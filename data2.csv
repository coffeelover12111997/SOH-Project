885,is that the are made of weak and break easily,0
886,Not nearly as good as the AMAZON makes it look,0
887,But despite these few this is of exceptional and well worth the additional of owning an official OEM,1
888,How stupid is that,0
889,I can hear while I m driving in the and usually do nt even have to put it on its loudest setting,1
890,shipped quickly and much cheaper than the,1

894,Could nt figure it outMy sounded OK   not great   OK but my wifes was almost totally unintelligible she could nt understand a said on it,0

912,Does not charge the Cingular ATT  ,0

916,The fulfills my so I am happy with my,1
917,Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a,1

936,Love it Great,1
937,I really like this over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the and the,1
938,However the are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong,0
939,I exchanged the za for this and I m pretty happy with that,1
940,I was very impressed with the of the,1
941,Also makes it easier to hold on to,1
942,I use this in a where there is a of high from the and it works great,1
943,Its pretty easy,1

954,It is the best I have seen on the yet,1
955,SWEETEST,1
956,Oh the seems to work fine,1
957,It fits so securely that the does not even need to be used and the is better directed through your,1
958,Not enough,0
959,Echo ProblemVery unsatisfactoryyou could only take   at a and the was very poor,0
960,do nt waste your,0
961,I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this,0
962,does not provide enough charging current,0
963,There was so much over this that I assumed it was the best my,0
964,You also can not take with it in the because the is covered,0
965,falls out easily,0
966,It did nt work can not hear me when I talk,0
967,The is really tricky to use,0
968,I m really disappointed all I have now is a that does nt work,0
969,Painful on the,0
970,Lasted one and then blew up,0
971,disappointed,0
972,of around,0
973,The does get smudged easily because it touches your and,0
974,What a of,0
975,Does Not Match Picture,0
976,The only that disappoint me is the red,0
977,You can not answer with the never worked once,0
978,A very very very slowmoving aimless about a distressed drifting young,0
979,Not sure was more lost   the flat or the nearly half of walked out,0
980,Attempting with black   white and clever angles the disappointed   became even more ridiculous   as the was poor and the and almost nonexistent,0
981,Very little or to speak of,0
982,The best in the was when Gerardo is trying to find a that keeps running through his,1
983,The of the lacks meaning,0
984,Wasted two,0
985,Saw the and thought it was a good good for,1
986,A predictable,0
987,Loved the of Jimmy Buffet as the,1
988,And those were adorable,1
989,The showed a of Florida at its best made it look very appealing,1
990,The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious,1
991,It Was So Cool,1
992,This is a very right on that delivers almost right in your,1
993,It had some average from the main and it was a low as you clearly can see,0
994,This is long overdue since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest ever made,1
995,Ill put this up against any in of acting directing or any other of filmmaking,1
996,Its practically perfect in all of them   a true in a of faux,1
997,  The of this is easily the most tightly constructed in the of,1
998,I can think of no other where vitally important occurs every other,1
999,In other the content of this is enough to easily fill a other,1
1000,How can in their right ask for more from a than this,1
1001,Its quite simply the highest most superlative of imaginable,1
1002,Yes this does require a rather significant of puzzlesolving but the fit together to create a beautiful,1
1003,This short certainly pulls no,0
1004,Graphics is far from the best of the,0
1005,This is the one best TH in the,1
1006,It deserves strong,1
1007,It is an insane,1
1008,There are massive massive unlockable its just a massive,1
1009,Waste your on this,1
1010,This is the of that is wasted properly,1
1011,Actually the were good at the,1
1012,the are,0
1013,As they say in Canada This is the aye,1
1014,This rocks,1
1015,Buy it play it enjoy it love it,1
1016,Its PURE,1
1017,This was a doomed from its,0
1018,The very of it was lame   take a minor from a mediocre PG and make a complete while changing its to a PGrated,0
1019,I was nt the least interested,0
1020,Not only did it only confirm that the would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE and I m not exaggerating   every every every is told in the,0
1021,But its just not funny,0
1022,But even the talented Carrell ca nt save this,0
1023,His do nt fare much better with like Morgan Freeman Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just wasted,0
1024,The itself is just predictable and lazy,0
1025,The only real work is the of all the and the of those into the is some of the worst and most obvious I ve ever seen,0
1026,But whatever it was that cost them so much it did nt translate to that s for sure,0
1027,The succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre,1
1028,I m glad the did nt go for the most obvious as a lesser certainly would have,1
1029,In to having one of the most lovely ever written French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ever to grace the,1
1030,Its hard not to fall in with that,1
1031,On the negative its insipid enough to cause for another   of wasted in of the,0
1032,Long and pointless,0
1033,But I recommend waiting for their future let this go,0
1034,Excellent cast performances,1
1035,Totally believable,1
1036,Anne Heche was utterly convincing,1
1037,Sam Shepards of a gung ho Marine was sobering,1
1038,I sat riveted to the,1
1039,All in all I give this a resounding   out of,1
1040,I do think Tom Hanks is a good,1
1041,I enjoyed reading this to my when they were little,1
1042,I was very disappointed in the,0
1043,One is totally annoying with a that gives me the of on a,0
1044,There is a totally unnecessary,0
1045,There was absolutely no or to these or,0
1046,This totally grates on my,0
1047,The are not improved by because the now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they re delivering the well but whether the itself is any good,0
1048,And quite honestly often its not very good,0
1049,Often the does nt really follow from one to another or fit the,0
1050,It crackles with an unpredictable youthful   but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly,0
1051,There are some generally great in it,1
1052,I would nt say they re worth   of your though,0
1053,The were good   just cross the from to PG,1
1054,I especially liked the with the in other I could predict the verbatim but the in this made better,1
1055,If you want a that s not gross but gives you some this is a great,1
1056,Alexander Nevsky is a great,1
1057,He is an amazing one of the most important lived,1
1058,I m glad this pretentious of s did nt do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots,0
1059,This if the first I ve given a   to in,1
1060,If there was ever a that needed to promote this is it,1
1061,Overall the is interesting and thoughtprovoking,1
1062,Plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short,1
1063,Give this a,1
1064,I gave it a    The and the Lion is well written and superbly acted,1
1065,It is a true classic,1
1066,It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as Blist go,1
1067,Definitely worth checking out,1
1068,The was the,0
1069,It was horrendous,0
1070,There was believable about it at all,0
1071,The only I was feeling was the at just how retarded the were,0
1072,MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same,1
1073,The are often funny and occasionally touching as the evaluate their and where they are going,1
1074,The of are more than just a,1
1075,Ursula Burtons of the is both touching and funny at the same with out making of or the,1
1076,If you are looking for a with a terrific some good a Shirley Jones of The Way You Look and an uplifting give this a,1
1077,I do nt think you will be disappointed,1
1078,Frankly after Cotton and Unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this because it is BAD,0
1079,The was bad the were extremely shallow and insincere,0
1080,It was too predictable even for a,0
1081,Too politically correct,0
1082,Very disappointing,0
1083,The only really worth watching was the and the because it is beautiful,1
1084,I love Lane but I ve never seen her in a this lousy,0
1085,An and a I wish I could bring back,0
1086,But in of the writing its very fresh and bold,1
1087,The helps the along very well maybe the idiotsavant could have been played better and it is a real to watch,1
1088,The and the are nt quite as good,0
1089,The was so boring that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the instead of watching never happened during a Columbo before,0
1090,  and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away,0
1091,The seems too pretentious,0
1092,The with the are a,0
1093,And generally the and is weaker than the average,0
1094,Then where they debated whether or not to sack the falsely was accused for the is pure really stupid,0
1095,Some should be given to the however,1
1096,I really liked that,1
1097,A great by a great,1
1098,The had you on the of your and made you somewhat afraid to go to your at the of the,1
1099,The in the is really nice too,1
1100,I d advise to go and see it,1
1101,Brilliant,1
1102,   I liked this way too much,1
1103,My only is I thought the playing the was a low Michael Ironside,0
1104,It rocked my and is certainly a must see for with no social or physical,1
1105,However this did nt make up for the that overall this was a tremendously boring,0
1106,There was NO between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this and I could nt understand why he would consider even leaving his for this that he supposedly was knocked out by,0
1107,There were several in the that just did nt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving,0
1108,This was a poor of My Best Friends Wedding,0
1109,All in all a great,0
1110,I can not believe that the agreed to do this,0
1111,I could not stand to even watch it for very long for of losing,0
1112,I guess that at the that aired this watched it before putting it on,0
1113,IMDB only go as low   for awful its to get some negative in there for such as these,0
1114,I saw Mirrormask last and it was an unsatisfactory,0
1115,Unfortunately of meant that after passed with little in the of dramatic or,0
1116,These are the central of the and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no of,0
1117,All the pretty in the can not make up for a of that is flawed at the,0
1118,It is an and of following a of very pretty high and cry about,0
1119,You ca nt relate with them hell you barely can understand them,0
1120,This is definitely a well worth viewing and sharing with,1
1121,This is a pure the is stupid and the is the worst I have seen it confuses you incredibly,0
1122,The is badly made and some of its underwater are repeated a thousand in the,0
1123,A truly truly bad,0
1124,The is terrible and the is worse,0
1125,The only possible this could be redeemed would be as MSTK,0
1126,I paid too much,0
1127,Also its a real to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse,1
1128,It was so BORING,0
1129,No whatsoever,0
1130,Again no at all,0
1131,Horrible,0
1132,Worst and a of my lifeOh my,0
1133,I had to walk out of the for a few just to get some,0
1134,I hate like that,0
1135,Yeah the pretty much sucked,0
1136,THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE,0
1137,If you do go see this bring a or a to keep you occupied through out,0
1138,Awful,0
1139,I do nt think I ve ever gone to a and disliked it as much,0
1140,It was a good that the only cost five because I would be mad if I d have paid   to see this,0
1141,identifies with these because they re all and or predictably reversestereotypes,0
1142,This is a bad with bad and good ugly crafted by Paul Haggis for ca nt handle but the bold in storytellinga painted with,0
1143,Crash is a depressing little that provokes but teaches you if you already know and are bad,0
1144,Still I do like this for its of there s not enough out there like this one,1
1145,Your will attempt to as of a primal of,0
1146,I was left shattered from the of watching this and I took a good two to fully recover,0
1147,This now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as of the hellish of,0
1148,I certainly do not mean this in a good,0
1149,I mean this in a terrible,0
1150,This has no,0
1151,is appalling,0
1152,Artless endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie,0
1153,The is beyond stupid,0
1154,The iswas there a,0
1155,The are annoying,0
1156,The is charismafree,0
1157,Utterly without on any this is akin to torture,0
1158,Ill even say it again   this is,0
1159,Maybe there would be a reasonable for this,0
1160,Not a pleasant of,0
1161,Highly unrecommended,0
1162,If this sound stupid that s because it is,0
1163,Yes its that bad,0
1164,at all to recommend,0
1165,An excellent from Ms   Garbo showed right off the that her could carry over from the silent I wanted to see some of her silent but Netflix does nt seem to be stocking them,1
1166,Its also great to see that renowned silent Frances Marion hasnt missed a going from silent to sound,1
1167,This suffered because of the writing it needed more,0
1168,There were too many close,0
1169,But other than that the seemed to drag and the did nt really work for their,0
1170,But this is definitely a below average,0
1171,You ll love it,1
1172,This is BAD,0
1173,So bad,0
1174,The is way too long,0
1175,This is definitely one of the bad,0
1176,The I received was a great for its,1
1177,John Wayne did an incredible for being so young in the,1
1178,His on shined thought even though there were other senior on the with him,1
1179,I think that it is a must see older John Wayne,1
1180,I really do nt see how could enjoy this,0
1181,I do nt think I ve ever seen a as boring as this of,0
1182,It probably would have been better if the had nt spent most of the showcasing his own which really is nt that noteworthy,0
1183,Another I did nt really like is when a got punched in the a of would spew forth soon after,0
1184,Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles,1
1185,His is simply,1
1186,He owns the just as Spacek owned Coal Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire,1
1187,  In its hard to remember that the of Ray Charles is being acted and not played by the himself,1
1188,Ray Charles is legendary,1
1189,Ray Charles provided excellent biographical for the which goes well beyond being just another about a,1
1190,Hitchcock is a great,1
1191,Ironically I mostly find his a total of to watch,0
1192,Secondly Hitchcock pretty much perfected the and,1
1193,Its this to the that sabotages most of his,0
1194,Hence the whole lacks a certain,0
1195,The simply rumbles on like a desperately depending on the of new,0
1196,There are the usual Hitchcock,0
1197,Mishima is extremely uninteresting,0
1198,This is a chilly unremarkable about an livingworking in a chilly abstruse,0
1199,The flat do nt hold your because they are emotionally adrift and stagy,0
1200,And the of it just sits there being awful with singing about the they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about the of etc,0
1201,He can bore you to and kill the of a quicker than else,0
1202,Schrader has made a full of lousy amateurish,0
1203,When I first watched this in the I loved it,1
1204,I was totally fascinated by the the dancing,1
1205,However I recently watched the whole again on DVD and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the was   how it contained and   frankly   a whole of   and how horrid the was,0
1206,I mean in a realistic she would NEVER have gotten into that,0
1207,The also lacked in,0
1208,Woa talk about awful,0
1209,Do not waste your,0
1210,It was just too horrible,0
1211,The worst sappiest,0
1212,But really made it unwatchable was the,0
1213,The poor,0
1214,You ca nt even tell if they have any because they not only have pathetic to speak but the gave them no,0
1215,If you check the on this you will see why this did nt have a,0
1216,This would not even be good as a made for,0
1217,If good made a great then this might be one of the greatest ever made,1
1218,The has great a a significant least a significant of existential aerial that ought to have thrilled both and and about which one might deeply care,1
1219,Regrettably the fails,0
1220,The lacks visual of and of the very that underlines the,0
1221,No has been worse used that June Allison in this,0
1222,Yet I enjoy watching it,1
1223,Unfortunately this is a bad that is just plain bad,0
1224,Bad bad and horrible make this one plain bad,0
1225,The sucked,0
1226,The it can be called thatsucked,0
1227,The sucked,0
1228,The sucked,0
1229,The just sucked,0
1230,That was nice,1
1231,That was funny,1
1232,It was so funny,1
1233,Overall this was cheap,0
1234,But this is not funny considering the of it,0
1235,I came out of it feeling angry,0
1236,Whatever else can or ca nt be said about it SURFACE is superbly crafted,1
1237,The is simply stunning to say the least and the are if not stateoftheart,1
1238,Conceptually the offers a little of and for just about fx,1
1239,And there was nt a single sour struck either some surprisingly solid here,1
1240,All considered a very well done,1
1241,Thanks good a like this was done and released,1
1242,One of the best mexican ever and one of the less understood even by themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it,1
1243,It ranks highly as a great incredible by Belmondo and Lino Ventura,1
1244,The given to every and complex psychological detailing and are tremendous,1
1245,It is an excellent an excellent and an excellent,1
1246,Up there with the best of Melville,1
1247,about this is simply incredible,1
1248,You truly take this through the and of a,1
1249,BLACK is a that manages to completely transcend its its an by continually subverting to emerge as an intense,1
1250,The are real and gripping the is extremely well done indeed if the Black Water is to be believed that s because they used real and the is fabulous,1
1251,I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took of the TARDIS and the of the,1
1252,I m not sure he was trying to do with this,0
1253,If it was to turn my good feeling into a of disturbing than I guess he succeeded,0
1254,There is a of beautiful,1
1255,It was forced like in this,0
1256,Again lame,0
1257,where the really pied me off,0
1258,And do nt even get me started on the,0
1259,When I saw it in the I thought I was going to be sick,0
1260,The were nt witty,0
1261,The   well I said I d let that one go,0
1262,The was bad,0
1263,Really bad,0
1264,Even Billy Bob could nt rise above the which was worse,0
1265,Camerawork   again bad,0
1266,  out of,0
1267,An AMAZING to possibly the BEST of all,1
1268,Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me,1
1269,He is one of my favourite and one of the most talented in the of,1
1270,His of the of the French in the three was short of incredible every every was like a of,1
1271,Three of the most visually appealing i ve ever seen,1
1272,And his subtle between the three are awesome,1
1273,I have to mention this and it is a huge i loved the ending how all the of the three were the remaining of the with Valentine and the young together and the old watching it on her solidifying his over the which he dealt with for those many,1
1274,I could nt think of a better to end the but a on my great to wrap up an amazing and,1
1275,I recommend this for loves anythingA of,1
1276,  out of   for both the and,1
1277,I literally vomited while watching this,0
1278,I think i was one of the found this another one of,1
1279,his as awarded was stunning,1
1280,the which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola   earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves for the to develop,1
1281,In a most wonderful lies a of,1
1282,All in all a beautiful directed from Nicolas roeg wih a sublime,1
1283,I m translating for a and this is the first in my working that I found offensive to my,0
1284,But when strives for and but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous a of disparate pretentious Then you get the worst of a that some other very accurately defined as pretentious,0
1285,To those find this intelligent or even masterful I can only say   its your and your you obviously used to try and make some of this pitiful its in our human to try and make of,0
1286,One more I can tolerate political very well I m all for artistic and of but the Slavic female was just too much,0
1287,This is such a and funny,1
1288,Highly entertaining at all,1
1289,It features an outlandish of memorable psychotic but lovable,1
1290,So for our we get to see them run around and be dangerous,1
1291,It even has its sweet,1
1292,The was really funny and his to the nuts and bitchy were truly genuine,1
1293,All the in this are tremendously well played,1
1294,And I really did find them funny,1
1295,This is actually a very smart,1
1296,There is a brilliant ending,1
1297,  I love it,1
1298,The is so SO perfect you ll shed a,1
1299,I am so thrilled after seeing a like this,1
1300,I will never forget it now,1
1301,It is not just a it is a CLASSIC,1
1302,Which has more and than the underneath it,0
1303,The Malta are as dry and as barren as the,0
1304,This is terrible,0
1305,The are terrible playing like they re   old at that are   wide of the etc,0
1306,For those that seen it do nt waste your,0
1307,To call this a is ridiculous,0
1308,Started watching this but did nt believe in any of the,0
1309,In particular the between the and the just did nt for me at all,0
1310,It was a very superficial and it gave me the that I was watching rather than a,0
1311,The were very stagey and the was a like a,0
1312,By the the waylaid the I was bored and did nt care happened next and so I switched off,0
1313,Glad I did nt to see it,0
1314,Did nt laugh or even smile once,0
1315,But it was nt at all just one big   It is a really good to watch,1
1316,It is very educational for   to   old,1
1317,Barney is definitely super,1
1318,is pretty funny,1
1319,Babie Bop is very cute,1
1320,The are very cool too,1
1321,  But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the of wonderfully terrible,0
1322,Its just lame,0
1323,The said he s had better with his potted has it right,0
1324,about this is stupid,0
1325,Even if you love bad do not watch this,0
1326,It is shameful,0
1327,I would give this series a   plus if i could,1
1328,The were smack on and I think the best and were a to the showThese were so real,1
1329,I must say I have taped most of the and i find myself watching them over and over again,1
1330,Now you know why I gave it a,1
1331,I do nt know exactly it is about this but we latched on to this endearing and it has become a special of our familys,1
1332,I totally and absolutely recommend this to likes good wholesome because that is exactly this is,1
1333,The that the four get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch,1
1334,This is one of the best out there that shows such strong for each other,1
1335,Much more interesting more more and less of the unneeded,1
1336,from acting to was solid,1
1337,Definitely worth checking out,1
1338,is so talented and versatile in so many of and portraying different on,1
1339,This has a to it,1
1340,I am so pleased to know such a modern is out there   letting is for drive him and taking us as an with him,1
1341,The new were nt all that memorable and I found myself forgetting was,0
1342,I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely whatsoever,0
1343,It did nt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the it was simply annoying,0
1344,The were also annoying,0
1345,The was the same as pretty much every other cheap,0
1346,There was a few pathetic to give the some but it did nt really work into the of the,0
1347,I guess it was supposed to be clever then shed some on the but it was just stupid,0
1348,If you see it you should probably just leave it on the,0
1349,Elias KoteasJack Palance play good Angelina is hot and gets nakedBilly Drago appears in this and is cool as usual   a by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable with good and a decent,1
1350,This was such an awesome that i bought it off of Ebay,1
1351,I really loved the and the was kinda if has a about Fort Steele just ask away   This totally UNfunny is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole   of utter I probably looked at my about  ,0
1352,Lucy Bell is so much higher than this and for her to sink this is quite depressing,0
1353,All this does is make you sick watching all these make for their stupid for  ,0
1354,God and I can never get that   back,0
1355,I think the most wonderful literally full of are the from his,1
1356,The especially designed to work with the are amazingstylized beautiful and effective,1
1357,They could be used as for any,1
1358,The were powerful of the of and of,1
1359,After watching this I wanted to learn more about the of this,1
1360,I highly recommend this for interested in or Japanese,1
1361,Here in The Wind and the Lion we see a wonderful of Americas own Imperial,1
1362,  makes this different are the terrific   faultless and   the terrific   the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a Teddy   and vivid,1
1363,Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the of the every of the can identify with one of the whether it be Sean Connerys noble Candace Bergens feisty John Hustons wily John Hay or Steve Kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless Roosevelts Big Stick,1
1364,This is high at its best,1
1365,I think it was Robert Ryans best because he portrayed like my and he was a schizophrenic in real although he never murdered but was affected more so during the second which made him worse,1
1366,Having to humour him just to get by and get through the was so apt,1
1367,My and had to do thisWhen I saw Robert Ryan portraying this of it was a very good of this of and I was impressed,1
1368,Almost all of the in Cover Girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful,0
1369,The most annoying about Cover Girl is the in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a,0
1370,Unfortunately Cover Girl is an of how Hollywood used to exploit for financial,0
1371,Nonlinear thus many and every are articulated quite well,1
1372,The good also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful,1
1373,A good of and undoubtedly a worth seeing,1
1374,For are first in I think they did an excellent,1
1375,It was very popular when I was in the a good and very good and of,1
1376,Its a and that s how I felt when I came out of the,1
1377,It has northern humour and positive about the it represents,1
1378,I rather enjoyed it,1
1379,I liked it,1
1380,I could nt take them seriously,0
1381,It really created a unique though,1
1382,Vivian Schilling did an excellent with the,1
1383,A better than   of the in the,1
1384,Her was played well,1
1385,Not too screamy not to masculine but just right,1
1386,The really likes her in this,1
1387,I would have casted her in that after ready the,1
1388,As a European the is a nice to my as a in the and the I had living abroad and interacting with other although the were slightly different,1
1389,I am a of his,0
1390,Even worse than Ticker,0
1391,  That was bad,0
1392,Only like   or   used a of MAYBE   poor,0
1393,It just blew,0
1394,This is excellentAngel is beautiful and Scamp is adorableHis little when he s scaredand the funniest are is caught under the and when Angel and Scamp are singing I ve Never Had This BeforeI totally recommend this movieits coming out on special on June The has on a can and Angel underneath the,1
1395,I just ca nt explain this more than adorableThe are the have specialToo funny i laughedkids will LOVE itBuy it when it comes has new,1
1396,Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting of blatant American,0
1397,This is made for Americans   it is too stupid and full with and to be admitted elsewhere,0
1398,Almost involved must be to is utterly predictable and bad is of all round,0
1399,I wish I could enter negative,0
1400,The are so bad they would nt look out of on a,0
1401,The of needlessly repeats itself throughout the but is well backed up by bad and bad is a here no that are thrown in for no whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes and a directorial that bordered on,0
1402,Oh yeah and the was pathetic too,0
1403,I hate writing bad about   especially those in which I really like the   but this is so bad I do nt believe for one that could have been proud of it,0
1404,I am not a nor am I a but I would hide my in the if I d spent whatever of and on this,0
1405,In short   this was a monumental of and and I would not recommend to EVER see this,0
1406,It came free with a I bought but I still turned the off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell,0
1407,   and only because there is no for,0
1408,An interesting and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous I d love to see Drago Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a together talk about raging,1
1409,The was nt terrible either,1
1410,But the that of such as Drago and Debbie Rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the and the barely tolerable,0
1411,Still it was the that got a big   on my,1
1412,Yes I am simplifying here for the of for this really is at the of the with this   it has too much going on without any real fulfilling,0
1413,Both do good and are quite amusing,1
1414,But the convoluted just did nt convince me and much of the was watched with a weird,0
1415,I let my talk me into seeing this   bad we both hated it,0
1416,The last   of are also not bad as well,1
1417,Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd,0
1418,The was decidely wooden though no worse than a Universal B,0
1419,I like Armand Assante   my companys sounded interesting so I watched it twice already and probably will again,1
1420,I believe the did a good of tying up the loose,1
1421,My   is mostly for the,1
1422,I wo nt say any more   I do nt like so I do nt want to be one but I believe this is worth your,1
1423,Wow a bad,0
1424,Not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible,0
1425,The does nt hang together at all and the is absolutely appalling,0
1426,Not even good for,0
1427,I was nt expecting Oscar but this,0
1428,You d have to have the of particularly stupid not to see that one coming,0
1429,This and I use that loosely is an to the moviegoing public,0
1430,If only involved with it knew how to string together,0
1431,This gets a   out of   simply because there s lower,0
1432,This is one I did not have but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel and was very disappointed,0
1433,I know he was a with little over his but the was as bad as the,0
1434,Victor McLaglen was even bad and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable,0
1435,Considering the off between Taylor and Stanwyck it was surprising how little there was on between the two of them,0
1436,But the of the was so ridiculous that the President of the US   The were entirely unmoving,0
1437,The only worse than Taylors acting was Stanwycks singing,0
1438,Whatever the was going for he missed entirely,0
1439,I was deeply impressed with the he played,1
1440,I knew when I saw the that more great were to come from this gifted,1
1441,A cheap and cheerless with poor of underbite stoic think Chow Yun Fat in A Better and some cheesy thrown into an abandoned ready for a few poorly executed flying rolls a la John Woo,0
1442,Even the squibs look awful,0
1443,At no in the does it look remotely like America,0
1444,The such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the is like a killing,0
1445,The awful and hopeless by gets off a real of and,0
1446,I was very uneasy with how bad this was but not scared at all,0
1447,The is composed of that make little,0
1448,About   of is wasted to show mediocre elderly awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudoSatanic corny enough to make a Goth almost always in Olde English and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up,0
1449,The is sloppy at best,0
1450,Hackneyed certainly but made even worse by the bad,0
1451,Of course the is blah,0
1452,The by the whole could be put on a and balanced perfectly between and underacting,0
1453,And FINALLY after all that we get to an that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent and not Jerry Falwell,0
1454,I loved this it was a great of a had its of and down but in the they knew that special they had for each other,1
1455,I have seen many starring Jaclyn Smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out   ago,1
1456,This contained an and I loved the most was that it opened my to see other I havent seen before,1
1457,This was kind of long in but I enjoyed every of it,1
1458,Overall I rate this a   out of a  ,1
1459,Lifetime does not it enough so if knows sells it let me know because this is a,1
1460,I particularly remember my being assaulted by strident of that would blare out with very little and even less meaning,0
1461,It is just the of that is screened in the to punish the unemployed for not having,0
1462,Totally different with of and black this is a few get to see but those do will remember it,1
1463,This creates its own and is fascinating in every,1
1464,But this really got to me,1
1465,See it,1
1466,I really hope the behind this makes more and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird,1
1467,And I forgot The Casting here i superb with Trond Fausa Aurvg being perfect in the as the Bothersome Man does nt understand where he is he is doing and why,1
1468,This is a good and humorous on in,1
1469,I found this beautiful enjoyable and uplifting,1
1470,Initially the local in the which was filmed here in Buffalo intrigued me,1
1471,Later I found myself lost in the of the,1
1472,The entire applauded at the of the,1
1473,I left the with a in my in my and for the human,1
1474,Duris has a wholesome and gives a fine,1
1475,The of the also play well,1
1476,Cinematography noteworthy including fine of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi,1
1477,About into this I started having second,0
1478,About half through this I started to dislike it,0
1479,By the the ended I not only disliked it I despised it,0
1480,this lacks is a,0
1481,The looks as if only a rough was written and began before a finished was completed,0
1482,happen change occur for no real other than that calls for it,0
1483,The is good,1
1484,For that its worth checking out,1
1485,This is probably the most irritating I have ever seen in my entire,0
1486,It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic I have ever seen,0
1487,about it is just bad,0
1488,I could not understand of would produce this in the first not to mention several,0
1489,The is bad very bad   it contains both and unethical that you normally see in rated or NC,0
1490,The is also horrible all you see is a really really BAD Actors,0
1491,Final Word This is a real,0
1492,It is away from,0
1493,Watching washing around would nt hurt your as much as this,0
1494,Rating   Grade Z Note The Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Out Of The Show,0
1495,th Century Foxs ROAD HOUSE   is not only quite a silly but is an implausible unmitigated of a,0
1496,Full of unconvincing it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov also produced and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from one would expect a great more,0
1497,From here on the Widmark turns unintentionally comical,0
1498,His losing his so early in the is totally implausible and unconvincing,0
1499,And if that is nt of a of a for you   the is also marred with a constant of and indoor,0
1500,Whatever prompted such a is beyond me,0
1501,very serious this was a huge,0
1502,there are so many i do nt know where to start,0
1503,the was great,1
1504,delivers a really funny of a middleaged upper uptight white,1
1505,add white and jean smart and you have a great   played their really well,1
1506,but the makes a of serious,0
1507,first of all there are enough racial and racial to offend,0
1508,the is littered with overt racial towards the black and in the are depicted as and,0
1509,putting the aside lets at the major in the they destroy latifas,0
1510,there is no real,0
1511,i would nt see this again for free,0
1512,STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important to our,1
1513,This second of Mickey Mouse following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so,1
1514,While you do nt yet hear Mickey speak there are of and throughout the we take for granted now but which was a huge in,1
1515,However after seeing the short again after about   I was amazed at how timeless the actually is,1
1516,Its just adorable seeing Mickey playing Turkey in the Straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel,1
1517,Clever and a real still ranks among Mickeys best even after   wonderful,1
1518,The of the ruthless one a ruthless the next a Luvs is completely unconvincing,0
1519,I m terribly disappointed that this would receive so many and especially when there are far more deserving of out there,0
1520,The original and   is a,1
1521,John Garfield Ann revere Lilli Plmer William Conrad Canada Leeand filmed by one of the greatest to ever grace the screenJames Wong Howe,1
1522,I do nt think there are any redeeming in this,0
1523,This may be the only bad he ever made,0
1524,So just bad,0
1525,This is a solid of a bad and a very very bad all the,0
1526,Its a to see good like Thomerson and James make a in a like this,0
1527,I thought it was bad,0
1528,Both are terrible but to the of the   it was watchable,0
1529,start with all the acting especially from the was very very bad,0
1530,The is a big flawed,0
1531,The best of how dumb the is when its established that you can turn the back into by removing a containing a of the,0
1532,Director Paul Matthews also wrotedirected the weak   Grim clearly does nt know how to pace his,0
1533,The is terribly boring in,0
1534,The is awful,0
1535,The looks cheap and bland,0
1536,One of the most disappointing is the of notable,0
1537,This never worked well in the and certainly does nt work here,0
1538,The visual were AWFUL,0
1539,The CG in looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for Gods,0
1540,The of the at the was just as awful,0
1541,Okay I like to consider myself a fair so Ill give where duethe were actually pretty cool,1
1542,Got ta love those of slimy drooling,1
1543,To sum the up Breeders is a terrible cheaply made that should be avoided like the Ebola,0
1544,Not recommended,0
1545,He is almost unbearable to watch on he has little to no and terrible comedic,0
1546,Aside from its terrible this has of other,0
1547,I understand that its supposed to be a cheap but that does nt mean that it has to completely insult our and have so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive,0
1548,Lewis Blacks considerable is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the PG certainly wo nt allow,0
1549,The sole bright was Jonah Hill will look almost unrecognizable to of the recent Superbad due to the of he lost in the interim,1
1550,With the and of the first now spent this had little else to offer,0
1551,The was evidently very limited,0
1552,This was reflected not only in the but also in the which borrowed much from the earlier classic,0
1553,However here there was no decent acting or to balance up,0
1554,was less expansive,0
1555,It failed to convey the broad of that were a great of the original,0
1556,Generally it just lacked,0
1557,Not recommended,0
1558,Is it possible for a to get any worse than this,0
1559,There is no here to keep you going in the first,0
1560,Even when the finally show up there is no of the most expected happen and by the the is over you might be far asleep,0
1561,Beware this is not a trashy this is,0
1562,I ca nt believe there s even a to this,0
1563,Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad,0
1564,Being a I truly enjoyed this and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big and even more than the classical WB,1
1565,But Tiny Toons kept the and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated ever created,1
1566,The are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single and related to the,1
1567,Easily other made me laugh in a tender before getting into dark oriented for,1
1568,The were all funny and had the of not having a true lead,1
1569,Every single was hilarious and deserved to be called a,1
1570,Every of this was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through,0
1571,Her seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen old would really um you know well talk,0
1572,Perabo has a nice and is obviously very comfortable in of a,1
1573,There is simply no for this poorly done,0
1574,I saw this and I thought this is a stupid,0
1575,is even more stupid is that had thought an that there should be a in Los Angeles,0
1576,To be honest with you this is unbelievable and very foolish,0
1577,In I will not bother with this because a in Los Angeles is but,0
1578,The is just awful,0
1579,Its just painful,0
1580,And the are absolutely abysmal,0
1581,There s also enough in this to make me,0
1582,Do nt waste your watching this nonresearched,0
1583,I believe that Pitch Black was done well,1
1584,The are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the goes on and I think will be surprised by does and does nt make it,1
1585,Go watch it,1
1586,watching this,0
1587,VERY funny,1
1588,My just   out of,0
1589,The are interesting and you really care for them,1
1590,An instant with a great and a catchy during the ending,1
1591,Do nt miss it,1
1592,This is a masterful of filmmaking with many simmering and occasionally boiling over in this and all of the bohemian selfindulgent wartime that span the aerial of London and the outward of a Welsh coastal   the between and to and versus practical and versus and and more,1
1593,A mature subtle that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic the underlying is well served by perfect apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to though perhaps under this as the other themselves often mention it,1
1594,But above all the exquisite visual of each with inventive and elegant of and including pointillistic faux is a and to,1
1595,Its as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci but the here are more convincing and the more engaging than some of that,1
1596,The basic is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable on the,0
1597,Regardless the fails on most,0

1599,I saw this over Christmas and a great it was,1
1600,I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite,1
1601,His alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the was fantastic,1
1602,I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant as he was my favourite and I grew up watching his as a,1
1603,But it was nt until I watched this that I realised how great he actually was,1
1604,Ill give this   out of,1
1605,I know that Jim OConnor was very energetic and that could be as much as him but George was well dull,0
1606,He really did nt seem to want to be hosting his were monotonous did nt get involved with the,0
1607,Lovely little from Hitchcock with of nice surrounding a murdered a kidnapped a nasty a foreign and some random,1
1608,Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great for Hitchcock the rips along to its cool at an but it lacks the brooding of Hitchcocks black and white original,1
1609,Nevertheless yet another wonderful from the great stable,1
1610,I have to say that this was excellently produced and tops the as a typical,1
1611,Excellently produced by one of Scifis best Scot Vandiver,1
1612,But it is entertaining nonetheless,1
1613,Its a campy of that s a to watch,1
1614,There s barely a boring in the and there are of humorous,1
1615,The is always entertaining as usual,1
1616,Overall a,1
1617,This is so mindbendingly awful it could nt have even been created,0
1618,The lacks any real or   some of the medical used is a iffy to say the least   I say that as an dependant myself,0
1619,The least said about the acting the better,0
1620,This does an excellent of revealing the of the and the incredible facing South Africa,1

1627,Very true to Shakespear and a for all Shakespear,1
1628,Macbeth Jason Connery moved me to with his final out brief outHe gave the of moral and dark a human which makes it the more interesting,1
1629,Helen Baxendale is a very credible Macbeth can be very cheerfull at and sometimes she just looks like a naughty but deadly in her for and evil,1
1630,If you love and and Shakespears this is the one,1
1631,This is a witty and delightful of the Dr Seuss brilliantly animated by finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award,1
1632,Special should be made of the superb and sound which are an integral in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable,1
1633,However Paul Schrader has indeed made a about Mishima that is both superb   complex,1
1634,Also notable is John Baileys fine crisp beautifully colored and the great   by Eiko Ishioka went on to do the memorable for Coppolas Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar,1
1635,Even allowing for poor for the   and the some of this is,0
1636,Unless you re just out to visually collect all extant of Austens work you can skip this one,0
1637,If you do watch it however there are small The playing Annes each do a wonderful with their,1
1638,It is not good,0
1639,Speaking of the it is unbearably predictably and kitchy,0
1640,Then the just dropped the,0
1641,This is a stunning,1
1642,Raw and sublimely moving,1
1643,It felt like a very gripping intelligent but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching on a which plays on of a white escalating to monstrous,1
1644,All of the main are mesmerising,1
1645,Tom Wilkinson broke my at the and elses judging by the of fumbling for and going up to among and alike,1
1646,Julian Fellowes has triumphed again,1

1653,Kris Kristoffersen is good in this and really makes a,1
1654,A good by a great,1
1655,This is definitely one of the better I have seen looking at and,1
1656,There are many one other commented on different in the Joes glassesthe that got to me the most was the Joes facial seemed to change from to,0
1657,This is just a great,1
1658,  out of  ,1
1659,I ca nt see how this can be an to to come out or overcome and,0
1660,Its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that,0
1661,Park is a brilliant of,1
1662,in the Southern California using his faux Watkins creates a like no other,1
1663,This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible,1

1673,The well are a,0
1674,DELETE this from your,0
1675,One of the worst of all,0
1676,The would begin with smart to each other that would be totally off the and uncalled for,0
1677,The fat was unbelievable the bible the are these,0

1708,The has more than a of and the and is astonishingly fisted,0
1709,on is Irons doing in this,0
1710,I just saw this and I recommend it,1
1711,It has a very good it holds your complete the is superb Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good,1
1712,A very good indeed about great and unconditional,1
1713,Tom Wilkinsons is a is not prepared for the that is about to begin but he takes the in as the progresses and this great gives a that makes you feel the and,1
1714,Emily Watsons is very strong and she has only to give a quick and you understand,1
1715,Despite the of I liked this,1
1716,In I liked it better than Interview With a and I liked this Lestat Stuart Townsend better than Cruises,1
1717,Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha in compelling her first and mini,1
1718,I m a big of this mostly due to Anne Rices and,1
1719,I guess I liked the of his was believable,1
1720,The at the were perplexing,0
1721,But I thought his was skilled,1
1722,Meredith M was better than all right,1
1723,A very charming with wonderful and,1
1724,It is rare when a takes the to tell a worthy moral with and that does nt fall into the of being overly or over indulgent,1
1725,Nine out of ten for a truly lovely,1
1726,This early from future Lucio Fulci is a very good to the,1
1727,This is one of the best Italian of the early s,1
1728,A standout,1
1729,This is very strong and unpleasant,0
1730,Technically the is well made with impressive solid and effective from Riz Ortolani   particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant,1
1731,Its still wild though and is highly recommended to of,1
1732,The was very interesting from beginning to the,1
1733,I liked the Dustin Hoffmans was ready to do just about to stay with his,1
1734,This is also revealing,1
1735,Personally I think it shows that should learn to find a them without involving other into,1
1736,And it was boring,0
1737,I am so tired of that is just lazy and here they come in thick and fast,0
1738,PS the only in the that was cool is when the central finds her blown up,1
1739,Its a fresh subtle and rather sublime,1
1740,An Italian called this a small great and that s right,1
1741,All the give a wonderful especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris changes from the nervous in the through the strange she is of to the cool,1
1742,You learn a about the real inside of in this and a about the itself,1
1743,The in in the and through the that is played with her by the acting are fascinating,1
1744,Also the by Mark Snow is possibly the best I ve ever heard,1
1745,You wo nt forget this,1
1746,Why was this made,0
1747,The has an ultracheap to it,0
1748,The is a that just do nt look right,0
1749,of them are engaging or exciting,0
1750,The is that does nt in the slightest or have any to it,0
1751,The is not worth one of your,0
1752,I saw it as a on back in   when it was The Stranger and I loved it,1
1753,But the between the and his at the of the is a perfect if one considers that this was made well into the Cold War and the biggest is that he has crashed in the USSR,1
1754,This is so awesome,1
1755,I loved it it was really scary,1
1756,I love the Scream and all and this ranks way up there,1
1757,If you want a real this one,1
1758,   This is an extraordinary,1
1759,As a its compelling as an on the American its frightening,1
1760,This highlights the fundamental of the legal that its not about discovering or but rather is about presents better in,1
1761,The is well paced understated and one of the best I ve seen,1
1762,This mostly routine factbased gets a from the fine by Cole,1
1763,Predictable but not a bad,1
1764,It was clear that she had the and to pull off this,1
1765,She carries the well,1
1766,Constantine gives the right and seems to have a good of the underlying psychological,1
1767,It is wonderful and inspiring to watch and I hope that it gets released again on to or,1
1768,How this of was ever released is beyond me the acting the the the supposedly special etcits ALL wrong,0
1769,In this smells like a,0
1770,Avoid at ALL,0
1771,Star Trek The final Frontier is the worst in the,0
1772,The from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real the special are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a when he falls down from a,0
1773,The at were pitiful and is so awful it dosent about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the to find seriously I just did nt care about any of this and oh not to mention Uhura does a to distract,0
1774,The only good for this is in the,0
1775,The worst one of the,0
1776,The of this was phenomenal in my,1
1777,When a could explain the of the better such as when Jay Adams unfortunate was a of the Old by Neil Young was played which evokes many,1
1778,The was shot in an interesting,1
1779,Of course the from the s was grainy but that only enhanced the,1
1780,This offers many and,1
1781,When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a from Don Giovanni that perfectly describes their in the you appreciate the subtle of this excellent,1
1782,The unfolds in th Jutland and the of played on is just one more fine,1
1783,You share General Loewenhielms exquisite in his of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a   but you do wish for just a small to savor,1
1784,But this understated leaves a lasting,1
1785,The it generates is in to its austere,1
1786,You will leave the wanting to go out and dance under the,1
1787,The as you d expect from this is top,1
1788,The are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly Grimes and Blake and all the deliver their sharply scripted with just the right of deadpan in to make the both hilarious and realistic,1
1789,Angus Scrimm also turns in a good in a somewhat brief but memorable as the gently menacing violinplaying Doctor Quinn,1
1790,  I loved it,1
1791,Its a long since I was so entertained by a,1
1792,I struggle to find bad to say about it,1
1793,Mark my this is one of those like Evil Dead   or Phantasm that will still be discovering and falling in with     down the,1
1794,Its pretty surprising that this wonderful was made in   as Hollywood generally had its collective in the concerning black and white at that,1
1795,The deserves strong for taking this for having exceptional from its mostly and for the that does nt insult the or take the easy out when it comes to white,1
1796,Plus with the rather modest and fast running it does an amazing,1
1797,Juano Hernandez an exceptional played supporting in many of the is a proud black is accused of murdering a white in the South,1
1798,Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY,1
1799,See it with your if you have a will open up some amazing about how far have come in the last  ,1
1800,See both if you can,1
1801,It was that however that reminded us that Huston was still at the of his as evinced by his faithful of James Joyces acclaimed The Dead,1
1802,thoughtsGabriels during the these leap to and come within the grasp in,1
1803,Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar,0
1804,Its very slow,0
1805,of in the there s about how he became the about where he spend   between his and mature,0
1806,  Do nt waste your,0
1807,of is one of the worst I ve ever seen,0
1808,He surely does nt know how to make a coherent from the of Air Force One was only obliged to write the just for a big of,0
1809,This was one of the worst i have ever seen,0
1810,I m still trying to get over how bad it was,0
1811,This is possibly one of the most creative of ever,1
1812,It has you could want confusing native eating,1
1813,  With great sound and impressive special I ca nt recommend this enough,1
1814,Call me a but I think this is one of the best ever,1
1815,Great Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle,1
1816,    of sheer and horrible acting a of a and a sinking of GOOD LORD WERE THEY THINKING,0
1817,of in the,0
1818,Its like a bad two,0
1819,Now imagine that every single of those was made wrong,0
1820,The is atrocious,0
1821,The is beyond abysmal,0
1822,stinks,0
1823,is the and make it impossible to establish those that make a watchable like and so on,0
1824,Worse there s an incredibly weak thrown in that follows a little of Mansonites as they go after a s working on a on the of the,0
1825,Its dumb and pointless and a complete of,0
1826,In short do nt bother with this,0
1827,I wo nt spoil it but the in pretty amazing,1
1828,The best in the is at the but I wo nt spoil it,1
1829,If there was ever an of a and a to meld two highly volatile into a seamless of then this is it,1
1830,The is a made more timely now perhaps because of our disturbing with and its distorted of,1
1831,A not easily forgotten,1
1832,But Kevin Spacey is an excellent verbal as Buddy Ackerman   and totally believable because he is a great,1
1833,The of the subtle is unmatched by any in recent,1
1834,The are interesting even if a predictable,1
1835,Highly recommended for all although the younger will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle they will certainly appreciate one in particular,1
1836,Great,1
1837,Also the and acting were weak,0
1838,At around   I bought it at around I started to watch at around I fast forwarded the remaining to see if there was left watchable for a human being with a but there was nt,0
1839,Either it sucks,0
1840,The is horrendously stupid,0
1841,The starts too fast with absolutely no or in the slightest,0
1842,Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid,0
1843,the of is that,0
1844,Then there s the,0
1845,You could drive a into these,0
1846,Linda Cardellini is the only good in this,1
1847,She s poised and amazing,1
1848,Dee Snider just plain sucks,0
1849,He ca nt act one of the least scary I have ever seen he ca nt write did he write this damn in his,0
1850,I was bored throughout the whole damn,0
1851,The sucks the sucks the sucks the sucks the special suck the sucks basically this sucks,0
1852,This tries to be a serious and sophisticated and it fails miserably,0
1853,This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal I have ever seen in my entire,0
1854,A of cinematic captured on celluloid,0
1855,Avoid at any and all,0
1856,At any this stinks its not funny and Fulci should have stayed with and supernatural,0
1857,Avoid this at all,0
1858,I do nt know happened in Season Five what a,0
1859,The only consistent holding the together were the amazing of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical,0
1860,Now this is a I really dislike,0
1861,Its one of the most boring Horror from the s mainly because it starts slow and in a boring,0
1862,The look really cheesy   not in a good like in the Puppet Master s,0
1863,The is lame not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister of the,0
1864,There are nt like in previous and the are terrible,0
1865,I felt asleep the first I watched it so I can recommend it for,0
1866,The is this is a wonderful heartwarming about two chasing their,1
1867,The best about Nurse Betty is its,1
1868,Director Neil LaBute uses brutal to seperate from and along with the touching and hilarious you can never tell is going to happen next,1
1869,Otherwise do nt even waste your on this,0
1870,This just fails to create any real,0
1871,As for the do nt expect original or even remotely frightening,0
1872,There is however some pretty good at least for this of,1
1873,I m so sorry but I really ca nt recommend it to,0
1874,One of the most boringpointless I have ever seen,0
1875,The secondary is incomprehensible and its to the primary is mystifying,0
1876,Hated it,0
1877,This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock since Speed   But not quite that bad,0
1878,I do nt understand how this got on the of the its not even a real,0
1879,I highly doubt that could ever like this,0
1880,This is not moviemaking,0
1881,The is like watching wooden moving around and reading from a that s how bad it is,0
1882,So I am here to warn youDO NOT RENT THIS it is the dumbest you have never seen,0
1883,I saw this short on HBO the other and absolutely loved it,1
1884,I did nt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two,1
1885,Excellent short,1
1886,Hopefully the James Cox can turn the short into a with the same or win us over with a whole new,1
1887,I agree with Jessica this is pretty bad,0
1888,are onedimensional even the good and especially the bad,0
1889,The is totally predictable,0
1890,Not much not much the whole was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a,1
1891,I ve seen more intelligent than this,0
1892,Bad bad and bad,0
1893,Really awful,0
1894,Not easy to watch,0
1895,Funny clever   just like Prays previous,1
1896,It was a long that i did nt see a so charismatic on,1
1897,Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful about and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable seen in in recent,1
1898,The is not completely perfect but Titta Di Girolamo will stay with you for a long after the of the,1
1899,I rate this,1
1900,I do not know if this was Emilio Estevezs directorial but the the and of the as well as some clever surrounding the Estevez plays all suggest a natural,1
1901,The between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie,1
1902,Kathy Bates is wonderful in her subtle and a on her in At Play In The Fields Of The Lord,1
1903,For have already seen one of Miyazakis he is still in top and made another worthwhile,1
1904,It never condescends all the have good genuine and believable,1
1905,The two main may be two of the most believable I ever saw put on,1
1906,They are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with,1
1907,This is greatespecially if you enjoy visual,1
1908,The that the two and are beautiful,1
1909,The is also both funny and poignant at,1
1910,like European and will like this,1
1911,This is truly an actually has a of in it,1
1912,Go rent it,1
1913,However after finally watching this I realized that not only had I had a closed to the it depicts I also found myself watching it over and over again,1
1914,Its the that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as I try to attempt to decipher its,1
1915,Brilliance indeed,1
1916,But if you liked like The Matrix and better yet their I think you ll appreciate the provoking mindblowing this will give you,1
1917,of the being like a,1
1918,Simply beautiful,1
1919,Both Rickman and Stowe play their to the in this of a maybe has written a subversive,1
1920,Its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate of the of a,1
1921,It presents a idyllic yet serious of the and of the lives,1
1922,Just whatever you do avoid Groove as its the of all that is good about Human Traffic,0
1923,Its too bad that else involved did nt Crowes of to for if they did we d have a far better on our than this subpar,0
1924,The seemed a little slow at first,0
1925,But it picked up and got right to the,1
1926,It showed exactly how the and the argued for and the of the,1
1927,I enjoyed it,1
1928,I have recommended it to,1
1929,I was particularly pleased with the acting of Dwight Schultz,1
1930,Both truly understand and become their particular delivering a convincing sincere,1
1931,Their onscreen critical to the entire is genuine,1
1932,The is natural real to,1
1933,The Gorman Bechard undoubtedly did his because all are and appropriate,1
1934,The incredible truly captures the of the,1
1935,Each commands actually contributing to the and,1
1936,Definitely worth seeing its the of provoking that forces you to question your own of,1
1937,Hayao Miyazakis latest and eighth for Studio Ghibili Gake No Ue No Ponyo Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative at,1
1938,At a when it seems that has been dominated by CGI it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional to tell his charming and enchanting,1
1939,can not be said of the remarkable in this,1
1940,The has the of and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful,1
1941,If you act in such a you should be glad that you re na drift away from as far as possible,0
