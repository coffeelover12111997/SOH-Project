0,0,  in   we bought a new taurus and we really loved it   so in   we decided to try a new taurus   i did not care for the style of the newer version   but bought it anyway i do not like the new car half as much as i liked our other one   thee dash is much to deep and takes up a lot of room   i do not find the seats as comfortable and the way the sides stick out further than the strip that should protect your card from denting it drives nice and has good pick up   but you can not see the hood at all from the driver seat and judging and parking is difficult   it has a very small gas tank i would not buy a taurus if i had it to do over   i would rather have my   back   i don t think the style is as nice as the the    and it was a mistake to change the style   in less than a month we had a dead battery and a flat tire br br  
1,0,  the last business trip   i drove to san francisco   i went to hertz rentals and got a   taurus   thinking it looked comfortable and professional   i found the seating to be uncomfortable for myself   as well as for my passenger now   seating comfort may not be important to you   but it is to me the fuel usage was fine   the car did get us there with no problems   but   it was such an uncomfortable ride for both of us   it is not as though i am hard to fit into a car   i am     weigh   pounds   and i am usually quite comfortable in most any car   but   the taurus seemed especially uncomfortable   for anyone who is thinking of renting a car for a long trip   i would suggest that the taurus     not be on the list of   be sure to get this there was a large trunk that allowed us to pack a lot of materials needed for the business end of the trip   driving it was a breeze   and everything   worked   right   i have no complaints about the standard making of the car   except in the comfort area   how important is comfort to you   on a long trip   being an uncomfortable driver is distracting to me   and it made the trip seem unnecessarily longer than it should have felt   i make this trip a lot   the saturn would have been a better choice for me   as i have rented this model quite often   it offers comforts that the taurus simply does not have if you are planning a long trip   or to buy a car that you intend to be comfortably seated in   check out the taurus on a longer trial basis than you might another car   you may find the same thing happening to your comfort  
2,0,  my husband and i purchased a   f and had nothing but problems   we have owned the vehicle approximately two years and it has spent at least half of that time in the shop the first problem was the valve covers were leaking   this problem took three days in the shop   when we went to pick it up   we found that the mechanic at the dealership did not replace parts that he had to take off   this took an additional week   because of the poor design   fixing this vehicle was not found to be cheap   nor could just any mechanic do the work next    within one week   the serpentine belt came off the pulleys and sheared off the air conditioning power plug   this also took nearly a week to fix   cause of this problem was unknown next   the clean air pump broke   again within a week   this took about four days to fix   when i picked up the truck after the air pump   i didn t realize at the time that the mechanic had not hooked back up a hose to the transmission   so   after driving it for three days   my transmission needed to be rebuilt   due to unavailable parts   a new transmission replaced the old   which was mated to a junk yard transfer case   this repair took about   days truck vibrates at about   miles an hour   so we spent     on a new front end   tires   balancing etc   this did not help the situation within two weeks the serpentine belt was replaced for the second time since i bought the vehicle   the truck had    miles when i took over so i expected some problems don t get me wrong   but newer vehicles are said too have    mile s i noticed a large loss of power after said repairs   then began the costly fixes and diagnostics to find cause of power loss   the gas mileage at this point is about mpg never increasing the belt replacement continued till the present date at a belt every month   the truck went into the shop again for transmission leaks to a dealership where the problems found mounted   once again unavailable and discontinued parts this is not even close to being all of the problems   but i think i ve said enough     
3,0,  i feel i have a thorough opinion of this truck compared to most who post evaluations of their vehicles   my truck has been owned by me since new and currently have k miles   i ve been meticulous with maintenance and treating my truck with normal duty activities   never exceeding the manufacturer s recommendations this is information regarding my vehicle and the excessive amount of problems found during an inspection   sept    it s reference for anyone else who has had the same problems or looking for information regarding warranties and extended warranties   you are welcome to give some feedback   vehicle    f   l x xlt w   off road    tow package    rims   everything factory install   all the top options included   extended warranty   purchased s version k mile bumper to bumper coverage when new    deductible per drive in occurrence   driving conditions   never taken off road   never towed anything of significant weight and never used inappropriately toward the last   miles of my k mile purchased extended warranty bumper to bumper plan   the passenger side power door lock failed and the abs light turned on   i brought it in to the dealer for an inspection along with some squeeking of the front end   thought it was a tire rim leak   problems found    all   tie rods   inners and outers   bad    lower ball joints   bad    abs codes c and c   ecu and hcu controller and module assembly   bad    passenger side door lock actuator   bad    power steering pump   bad   air conditioning warranty replaced back at k miles   all items above were replaced under the purchased extended warranty bumber to bumber plan   except a kit for the module assembly on the abs   i will dispute that today   but had to pay for it to get it done   i am shocked that this much damage was found for a vehicle at only k miles proclaimed to be   built tough   yet only offering a k mile manufacturer warranty   if i did not have the extended warranty   i could only guess the bill to pay for this the extended cab seating is extremely cramped   my friends refuse to be a passenger in the back   the rear bench seating is hard   very uncomfortable   general motors seems to have very comfortable and roomy seating in their comparable models   the ignition is hidden and difficult to find   the stereo is second class for sound and tuning stations   especially am   factory installed tires have no significant grip traction after    miles   i recommend getting a spray in liner to help prevent the large dents and scratches that have happened in my truck   but not trucks that have been sprayed   the metal can t hold up and appears thin for the bed i do like the exterior look of the f   the height is fantastic   i can see all around while driving   it certainly upsets small vehicle drivers behind me   tailgating me and assuming i m a slow road hog in the left lane   but when trying to pass   they see the road jammed full of cars in front of me   bumper to bumper   accelerations and towing torque are very good   although now i sense a loss or hesitation on a occasions when i have to suddenly put the petal to the medal to avoid accidents expect to pay the value of your truck in maintenance costs from the dealer   they make their money on repairs and maintenance   very expensive   i m not complaining about this   but you buy and expensive truck   expect to pay for the maintenance  
4,0,  as a mother of    all of whom are still in carseats   the only logical thing to do was to trade in my sx for a minivan   as the minivan is only one of a handful of vehicles that have the room my family requires   in addition   we bought a new one so the mechanical difficulties would be minimum i love the fact that the van seats so many people   i never have to worry about bringing   cars   even if i have me kids with me the van seats added passengers   it does so in a roomy way as well i like the way the windstar handles   it has great acceleration   i like the fact that you are able to see way infront of you while driving   but these features are almost always indicative of all vans   or at least most of them i hate the fact that this vehicle has broken down   times leaving myself and my children stranded on the side of the road   each time we brought it back to the dealer where they said they fixed it   each diagnosis was different   the engine lights continues to go on   to this day   this makes it difficult if not impossible for me to feel safe in the windstar   thankfully   my husband is quite mechanical the windstar handles well   it is easy to steer and control   much like driving a car   some vans have steering that is difficult the suspension on the windstar leaves something to be desired   i have the privledge of feeling every bump the brakes are sound   i have yet to have them fail or squeak severly people who should buy this vehicle are those with alot of children or who need to transport alot of things   anyone who enjoys sports cars    fast vehicles   should avoid this car br br  
5,0,  the winstar is a car that i would not recommend purchasing   i have driven this van several times and i can t get used to it   the handling is horrible do to it s swaying feeling   it actually feels like the car is going to tip over in some turns   the side passenger window creates a blind spot   which i think is dangerous   where the side window meets the windshield is where i think the problem is   when braking it also feels like the driver doesn t have control do to the car having a difficult time stopping quick   this car doesn t stop efficiently   it doesn t handle well and it also doesn t provide the driver with a very good frame of vision on the passenger side   i feel that this is a safety hazard not only to the driver and their passengers but also to everyone else on the road   not recommended by me br br  
6,0,  we bought this van in    after having been a rental since it s   birth   initially we loved it   it was everything we had dreamed about and more   there was plenty of room for   and rode extremely nice   even in the very back   we had heard nothing but good about this van   it s safety ratings   ease of driving   etc   it was the gl model   and had rear heat air and stereo controls   the front seats were bucket   while the two in back were bench   everything about it was wonderful until we had around    miles on it and the transmission went out of it   things seemed to roll downhill from there   we replaced the tranny and a few weeks later the interior of the sliding door fell off   it had constant problems with the ignition switch and was always dinging whether or not the keys were in it   the lights were on   whatever   the interior lights stayed on all the time as well   the door ajar light was always on   no matter what was done to ensure that all the doors were closed   no lie   a few times this van even started itself when the keys weren t even in it   the gas mileage was only about    mpg   the air conditioning would literally run you out it got so cold   we never did have any problems with the air or heat   it rode very nice   and drove very nice   but all in all   i d say it definately wasn t worth the money paid   and was more of a headache than it was worth  
7,0,  i bought the focus wagon for it s cargo space   it s great for camping and the hardware store   the ride is smooth and quiet   and it handles quite well   it has a solid feel compared to our lancer   i wish the gas mileage were a little better   it does have nice features like an adjustable seat belt height in the front seat   big door pockets   seat warmers   the windshield wiper is still the best on the market   the biggest problem i have is that it leaks terribly in the back   i plan to take it in to get that fixed   i have had to clean the trunk carpet twice with a bleach solution to kill the mold mildew that has set in   the other issue i have is that the vent allows too much engine heat through in the summertime   this is a bummer if you are expecting cool air in the spring or fall to come through   the sun visors are almost useless as they do not go all the way forward   they sag too low and block too much of the road   i went from a escort wagon to this car   the focus feels like a luxury car compared to the escort   i will give this car a chance   if the leak can not be fixed   i ll look for another car  
8,0,  you ve probably heard about the giant   excursion sport utility vehicle   which carries a significant price tag which relates to its size   according to safety experts   when you spot the excursion on the road   pull off the asphalt after having wet your pants in fear and hide in the gutter to avoid any chance of making contact with a machine so big it feasts on coupes for snacks   and sedans for entrees   the excursion isn t a utility vehicle meant to haul large families and large things that smaller vehicles can t   only about    will be built the first year excursion s strong point   its huge size   is also drawing criticism   it took a   horsepower v   to maneuver the   foot   excursion over winding roads with minimal strain   not sure if the base    liter    h p   would have fared as well   estimates that the    liter will deliver   to   mpg city highway   the    liter   to   mpg   and the    liter turbo diesel   to   mpg with boat attached   the v   performed admirably   which   after all   is why excursion exists   to provide those   who need to tow big   heavy things   a big   heavy vehicle   once the boat was unhooked   the v   managed twisty   hilly roads without coming up for air   but even without a boat   excursion isn t going to run from the light   the suspension has a tendency to be firm but has been adjusted to prevent bone jarring movement on uneven pavement   handling is surprisingly pleasant   the steering offers   low effort movement   to balance out the size and weight without being so loose you don t feel in control   but don t expect to take a tight corner with ease as you would in say   an explorer   and the turning radius is   well   let s just say you ll need three to four lanes for a u turn   excursion comes with four wheel   anti lock   disk brakes   even with normal braking   be sure to apply the pedal earlier to account for its size   there will be some who complain excursion is too big   they probably will be the owners of tiny vehicles frightened by the excursion   in my test drive   the excursion never grabbed another vehicle and slung it from my path in back   the standard trailer hitch and associated hardware was designed to sit low to keep vehicles from submarining under excursion in a rear end impact   excursion is garageable   if the garage is at least   feet deep and the door at least   feet high   inside   excursion has three rows of seats to handle eight passengers   nine if you decide to go for a front bench seat rather than a massive center section with a writing top    cup holders for front and rear passengers   and enough room inside for tape cd coin holders plus the optional six cd changer   entry to the third seat is easy   press the handle and the second seat back lowers and the bottom slides forward for wide open entry exit in back   however   once in the third row   you are directly over the rear axle   putting you in touch with all the road harshness   other features include a full size spare inside along the side wall that still allows a decent amount of room   and folding second and third seats increase cargo capacity   the third seat is on rollers so it can be removed or folded against the back of the second seat for more cargo room   and it contains tons of room behind the third seat for luggage or golf clubs without removing it   other goodies include   cup holders    power plugs    coat hooks   second and third row reading lamps   rear cabin audio controls with dual headphone jacks   overhead console for garage door opener and eyeglass holders   despite excellent glass hatch visibility   there s one glaring problem in back on excursion   it stands so tall i lost sight of a bmw z   that pulled up behind me at the light   which means objects such as pets or kids that are even smaller won t be seen when you back out of the driveway   offers a sonar reverse sensing system on the windstar mini van that beeps to warn of objects when backing up   it should already be here   but it will be offered on excursion   hopefully   soon   if you have kids   you might want to wait for it   dual air bags are standard with belt minder   which sounds a chime every   seconds as a reminder to buckle up   the excursion is offered at a starting price of     for wd   and     for wd     
9,0,  if you thought that the gmc suburban was big   wait till you see the   excursion   this vehicle dwarfs even the biggest of all suv s   and in the race for the biggest and the baddest suv s takes the cake   outside the vehicle closely resembles the f with its front and grill   there is plenty of chrome to make it glitzy enough   it s big   the step in height is high even for a tall individual   and it takes quite some effort to get in   the tailgate is gigantic with two doors that swing wide out to the sides   once inside   you will be lucky if you can get inside   you will notice an abundance of space   but it s not much more than the smaller suburban   it s comfortable   but again a caravan is just as nice in the inside as my opinion   the limited version has a leather and wood interior and seating for up to nine   although most cars are outfitted for seven on eight people   it is comfortable and there enough space even in the way back   the vehicle is powerful enough for passing effectively on the highways and is comparable to the suburban in accleration   but the handling   the handling is terrible   it s a truck   it s a truck disguised as a suv   it s hard to maneuver   and the turning radius is horrible   if you are in the market for a vehicle with a lot of room   and with all wheel drive that can handle in the snow   a much better choice than the excursion is the caravan with all wheel drive   it s better on your wallet too   with a better price and its much better gas mileage br br  
10,0,  i went for a test drive in a   excursion with the eddie bauer trim package with a friend who is looking to buy an suv pretty soon   i ve always owned coupes and just one sedan in my lifetime   so this was very different for me   when i got behind the wheel so he cound ride in the back and check it out   i has a mix of feelings   i did feel like i was in tank or something because i was ridding high and felt the sheer magnitude of the truck as being something that was confidence inspiring   however   i didn t feel like i ws in control of the vehicle   stoppng disances were super long and if something or someone happen to dart out in front of the truck   there was no way to safely swerve and aviod a most likely fatal collion with the victim   the truck rides nicely for it s size   the feel is very firm considering how large it is   the interior was done very nicely in leather trim   but i didn t at all like how it s simply kind of a dressed up super duty truck interior   if you re paying over k for this thing   you deserve a little more exclusivisity   the exterior styling is very nice rough and rugged   the taillings are a little too similar to the econoline vans   but that s okay i suppose   my friend lives in a rural area and is involved in shipping large equipment on trailers   so it s the right kind of truck for him   however   i think people that simply buy this thing to use as a status symbol are pretty shallow and basically stupid   i don t see the logic is sayign you ve got the biggest and baddest truck out there when you have to pay over    to fill er up and use it to do things like go to the mall and take drive to work in alone while burning gasoline galore in gridlock   i d imagine parking this thing is a nightmare in tight urban spaces a parallel park might require one of those guys at the airport that guide the planes in with lighted torches   this vehicle also inspires a sense of false security and superiority in the event of a collision   people just simply think   quot if i crash   the other guy will die haha quot that might be true   but you ll pay later aside from the legal consequences   depending on if it was your fault you will have to live with the fact that because of the vehicle choice you made   you may have cripple   injured   or possibly even killed someone out there   the thing that s most frightening about this truck is that people who buy it in the city tend to be the type that chat away on cell phones all of the time that habit combined with the desructive potential of this thing can and will lead to many tragedies   you d think that the problem of teh wrong type of buyer getting this thing would be solved by the high gasoline prices   but that doesn t seem to be the case perhaps if we see prices over     per gallon   bottom line   made a good truck here   but it can t play big brother to control who buys people really need to become aware of the fact that suv s do have dangers associted with them   i e   rollovers are more common   and make better choices   in the hands of the right buyer this truck is great     
11,0,   this segment added later it appears as though is finally coming to terms on its suv line   they admitted that their suv s were not as safe and environmentally friendly as they should be and will take steps to make them safer for the occupants   other drivers and the environment   another interesting twist   just this week decided to reduce production of excursion by    that is not a small percentage   i saw this happening long ago   this is the first step in dropping the line all together   any guesses on the value of the excursion you just bought when that happens   maybe william jr read my epinion and decided to take action all i know is there is one more to add to my do not buy stock list the purpose of epinions is to post an opinion that may help someone make or not make a purchase   i hope my opinion will prevent someone from purchasing an excursion   i don t own one   and wouldn t   i m not sure if i d even test drive one   i haven t yet anyway   this shouldn t detract from my view however   for example one need not be a cuban or cuban american to have an opinion on elian and whether he should go home or stay here   opinions are after all one sided   some will agree with me   some will not   personally   i take the stand of i really don t care if you buy an excursion or not   but if you do buy one take responsibility for what may happen high gas prices   tough   kill or injure someone in an accident   gt   go to jail   do not pass go   do not collect     shouldn t have built it in the first place   the managers at should have looked a little further than   quot today quot   to analyze buying trends   especially ones set by texans   we as a group are statistically not the smartest of the bunch   i just live here   was born in indiana   traditionally   all new trucks are tested and marketed in texas first   instead of building the biggest on the block   they could have made a different statement   has done this many times and always looses their shorts on it   to this end they should have realized that fuel prices couldn t be cheap forever   infact it should be at least     a gallon anyway   we ve been spoiled by cheap gas that the automakers don t market fuel efficient vehicles here   but yet you can buy several cars that get    mpg in europe   even the suburban   which is still not great   claims to get   mpg on the highway much higher than the estimates of around    the dealers tell of   in the dallas fort worth area   dealers are offering more than    off on them   which means that they aren t selling them   within   years i don t think the excursion will be built any longer   excursions don t have to post gas mileage at all   they don t have to even conform with epa regulations   and by stating that is it a lev   low emission vehicle   must be a comparison to a coal burning power plant   there is no way you can burn so much fuel and produce as much pollution as a honda   come on the excursion s gas mileage doesn t even bother me that much   heck   not too long ago   i owned a   cadillac hearse   yes it had dead people in it at one time   it only got   miles per gallon   i not once complained about it   what irritates me is the people whining about fuel prices who do drive these vehicles   when ever there is something on the news about gas prices there is always someone griping but has a big ole truck my big issue is the safety issue   clearly these trucks are dangerous to other cars   the automakers just last month publicly recognized this fact and are making steps to prevent deaths   why couldn t they have done this earlier   i could care less if a stupid person kills them self   in any vehicle   but when they kill someone else that really bothers me   especially so when they purchase a vehicle that they are not capable of driving unfortunately this is many times   quot soccer moms quot   they want a sense of security and safety   they have an excursion full of arguing kids   they have an added distraction of a cell phone and other stuff   yes   they are completely safe to its occupants   but what about the guy in the miata she just plowed through   any vehicle which has to have a bar put under the front and rear bumpers to keep it from   quot monster trucking quot   over smaller cars is inherently not safe to others   no matter what you do one good thing i saw was that there was a guy in california that was charged and convicted of manslaughter for killing someone in an accident because he had a big suv and a phone and went through a red light and killed someone   finally a jury that did the right thing br br  
12,0,  suv s   sob s and pms great what a deadly combination   now the old mad woman on the cell phone has something larger to hit her target w   i can t eescribe how angry i am w   these tanks going down the road just waiting to slam into my   off show truck   i wanted to see what this was all about so i test drove one   there wasn t one blind spot there were five   i just can t see how anyone would want to drive one of these   i feel that if you are going to spend     on something why not buy some thing stylish and comfortable   i mean come on cadillac offers night vision now how cool is that br br  
13,0,  hey everybody   i don t own this car   i haven t ever driven this car   but i do have opinions about it   and i might as well share them my car is a saturn sl   go read my review   a car that is constantly subjected to being blinded at night by suvs and trucks coming up behind us   this is an annoying problem   maybe one that saturn should address   but still something of a concern   and i love trucks   i wanted a truck   before i got my car   and maybe someday i ll get one anyway   i m not in any way implying that there s any reason not to make trucks but the excursion   named big truck by some of my friends   is simply too big   if you live where i live   you just don t need this vehicle   most likely   and you re endangering all of us by just driving it   i d like to know why half of the parents in my town bought their excursions   whether it was for safety   or trendiness   or because minivans just aren t cool anymore   i d like to start a discussion about these mammoth suvs so that they don t just keep getting bigger and bigger   so that eventually cars and trucks can be of compatible sizes and not create major problems for each other just by sharing a road the excursion is intimidating   and maybe that s what s appealing to some people   if one is near me on the highway   i want to get away from it   i do not believe they can see me   in my smaller car   and i don t want to get crushed   i ll do whatever i can to avoid an excursion   and i m no meek flower of a driver   these cars are apt to roll over   can t stop quickly   and the blind spots are tremendous i have seen the most amazing sights concerning the excursion   one day i was in a parkinglot behind one   and i sat mezermerized as big truck tried to fit into a rather wide space   it took more than seven adjustments   back out   pull in   back out   for big truck to park crookedly   and there was absolutely no room for me to squeeze by   then   another day   in another parking lot   i saw a ten year old kid try to hop up into the passenger s side of the truck   he missed the seat and fell right onto the ground   i don t doubt that this happens all the time   i had a hard time not thinking about my tiny grandmother trying to get into this tremendous truck   a simple footstool   like the one she uses to get into our plymouth voyager   wouldn t be enough to even reach the excursion s step   big truck is much too big please   excursion lovers   don t hunt me down to run me over with your truck   i m not trying to take away anyone s fun or anyone s vehicle   i just wish that people would think a lot harder before buying into the excursion club   the power is appealing   the size is apalling   buying this truck makes you responsible for driving in a whole new way   if you need an excursion   surely   go buy one   if you have to cart around ten people and a boat and luggage and some furniture all at once   by all means   get this truck   but please   keep in mind that not everyone on the road is in a big truck and that we have rights as well   just don t buy this truck without a lot of heavy thought  
14,0,  i bought this vehicle to have a safe vehicle to transport my three young children on the california freeways my excursion is a   wheel drive v   i have had two major problems with this vehicle    the back end of the vehicle bounces from side to side whenever driving over a drain or small pothole in the road   i nearly lost control of the car driving on the   freeway at mph   has test driven the vehicle   acknowledged the problem and has refused to take the vehicle back   i think it is because they are nervous about receiving all of their vehicles back   any   wheel drivers experiencing the same problem a test driver from the dispute settlement board has driven the vehicle and another   quot like vehicle quot   and found the same problem   i am hoping that the board rules that take the excursion back    all california excursions have a   quot flutter noise quot   that sounds like five holes in the exhaust   this information is in the auto s   quot technical service bulletin quot   available at the dealer of purchase   is aware of this problem and has no answer for it the dealer has informed us that this car really maintains control only when it is filled to capacity with adults and is towing a heavy load   they recommend lowering the tire pressure to below recommended levels   we have had and been extremely satisfied with the lynx   sable   explorer   bronco and expedition   i would not at all recommend the excursion to anyone br br  
15,0,  so it is the new fad for mothers to drive   expeditions   suburbans   land cruisers and now excursions ok maybe it is nt a new fad   the   quot death trap quot   excursion is exactly how it sounds   it is a monster but is it really worth the extra   quot room quot   this thing is an incredible undertaking to drive   you must be constantly aware of everything around you   the truck barely fits within its allotted space   on the right side of the road   built off of the frame of the f   truck   the excursion has not particularly crash tested well either   i test drove one of these while helping a friend s family pick out a car   i must say that i can not recommend it   no pickup   not that any is needed   and terrible turning radius   the extra insecurities are simply not worth its size   whatever happened to the mini van   it s roomier   more comfortable   and more efficient   but it just does nt seem to be in style anymore   until then i believe every   quot soccer quot   mom feels its necessary to have a wd expedition   suburban   or excursion   when driving the excursion you will not be worried about your own safety   but those around you instead   make sure you can handle the ridiculous size before you join in on the large suv fad oh yeah and good luck finding a parking spot br br  
16,0,  now i m no granola munchin   hippie but this beast of a car is a hazard to the environment and everyone else on the road   while it may be roomy   can easily fit   people   this means that the suv must weigh   tons   the vehicle is over   feet tall and wider than most parking spaces   all of this excess means one thing   if you are involved in a accident with one of these you will probably be killed    it s like going up against a monster truck   don t let fool you either   these cars   suv s in general   do not have any emissions standards so basically these things pollute as much a big rig   with the surge in the popularity of these things that means that the earth is becoming polluted at an even more alarming rate   so maybe the environment or the hazards to everyone else don t phase you   you have your mind set on one of these babies   just check out the price and the gas mileage these things get   if you live in ct like me then the price of gas alone equals the price of the car in a few years if you drive at least   miles a day   all of these things means that this excess room is just costing everyone else including the owner   if it s room you want then get an rv or a van   just not a stupid   ugly suv br br  
17,0,  i am going to start this off by telling you that i hate big cars   they guzzle gas like nobody s business   this one is in the   mpg range   they are a danger to anyone not in them on the road   and   despite their ludicrous size   they never have any room for their passengers   s new excursion is the worst of them all   this monstrosity is like something out of a horror film   when i see it on the road i expect it to start roaring and try to run me over   seriously though   i feel like there is a genuine risk to my life when i am driving near an excursion   and they are a horrible risk to the environment as well br br  
18,0,   drive these cars i don t care how many damn children you have   or how many boats you tow daily   this not a   necessary   car for anyone these trucks are eyesores and harmful to the environment   i m so far from an being eco terrorist   but these machines are inefficient   gas guzzlers that make the air nasty to breathe   bigger   better   deadlier   these are not safe cars   the momentum that a truck of this size has will give a whole new meaning to   whiplash   indeed these are long   too   long and tall   dangerous   because regular cars can t see the road ahead of them   and even worse that people have no idea how to handle these things   why are these machines classified as class   b   vehicles   like yugos   volvos or fiats the only thing that makes me madder than the cars are the morons who feel the need to drive them   soccer moms have traded their piece of cak mini vans   which i m actually starting to miss sharing the road with   compared to these suvs   explorer owners trade in for the expedition and the excursion   it s an endless cycle of mechanical penis envy   yuppie materialism   and blind faith in   safety excuse me   i ve got to go   i ve got gastanks to urinate into    where s my stepladder  
19,0,  our big search for a larger vehicle started when i found out i was expecting another child   at the time   i was driving an old volkswagon bug and i had two children already   we looked at quite a few brands   the only one i didn t feel comfortable with was s   i had heard a lot of negative feedback on those cars   when we saw the aerostar on the lot   my husband wanted it right then   it was clean and comfortable with a sporty look   i wanted to look a little more   i researched it online to make sure we were getting a good deal   we had looked at   drove   and researched over a dozen before thinking about narrowing down our options   when the dealer lowered his price to what i felt was an awesome deal   we decided to buy it   for not wanting a to begin with   i would have to say that this vehicle has been one of the best we have owned   it is very dependable and comfortable   the air conditioning and heating works well   it even has a windshield wiper on the back window   that is something i never had on any of my previous vehicles   the engine works wonderful   not a squeak or grind anywhere   though it is compacted into a small place   i am sure it wouldn t be that hard to fix if something did go wrong   i don t know much about the specifics of the engine   but it will change from car to car   so the specifics aren t as important here as the quality   recently   we took out the back seat and went shopping for a very large toolbox for my husband s work   i couldn t believe we fit it in there with one of the back seats still in   i guess we don t need a truck after all updated     my mind definitely changed within the   months we have owned this vehicle   within a month   the door started having trouble closing   in about a month after that   the screws started falling out of the door and the panel was loose   the latch to close the door started sticking also about a month ago   the front passenger door has some problems also   the panel started falling out there as well   though i have a lot of children   we do no more wear and tear on this vehicle than a mini van should be able to stand up to since it is made to carry children   i don t feel we are overly hard on it   yet   the van keeps falling apart at an unbelievable pace   i will stick with my gut instincts next time and stay away from vehicles br br  
20,0,  we bought a   van used in    we fell in love with the beautiful conversion package   it was very unique   we received many   many complements and offers of purchase over the past few years   but our problems began within two weeks of purchase   the abs system went out so we took it to be repaired and within the next two months it was out again   so to the shop it went   it was repaired again and lasted until the end of    in   the abs system went   the rear end started going out   the air bag went out   and the transmission was slipping   this van was babied the whole time we had it   so we do not understand why all the problems   we knew people with older vans who had    plus miles and not a bit of trouble   ours finally had hit    and was going out of commission   we have now traded our for a mercury villager and absolutely love it   the was nice for show   but that was about it   i will miss it   but now i don t have to fight the wind   put up with a slipping transmission   or worry about my airbags deploying when needed br br  
21,0,  we bought a   extended cab x because of its low price   and granted   it s a smooth ride   an attractive vehicle and the engine has started even on the coldest of mornings   but we live in the mountains and a four wheel drive vehicle is a must   after just two years   the hubs on our went out and cost us over    in repairs   the mechanic told us that is notorious for these hub problems   a result of poor engineering of their shift on the fly x mechanism if you can live without a four wheel drive   then the low cost factor of the may outweigh this consideration   but if you re into off roading or just need to plow through winter snows   don t buy the x br br  
22,0,  for generations the men in my family have insisted on purchasing trucks   and usually buy the f   series   sometimes the trucks where loaded with extras   but most of the time they bought just a plain unusual pickup truck with standard transmission   power brakes and power steering   and what they thought to be   a good solid engine and transmission true enough   when first purchased   these trucks looked great and were great to drive   the exterior was flawless   shiny   eye appealing   and had lots of showoff value   the performance during the first year of use was near perfect   and   of course   the owner was very proud to show off that new truck to his fellow hunters   fishermen   farmers   and offered everyone and their brother free rides but now   time has passed   and several years down the road and   lt    miles later   their tune has changed drastically   all the trucks have lost their luster   the paint is peeling off   numerous rust spots all over the cabs   roofs   and around the wheel covers   and the owners are frustrated and certainly don t have the money to have a new paint job   the standard transmissions all are failing miserably and the truck is often in the shop being repaired   the universal joints are going out   wrecking havoc in the life of the offshore worker who must be at work on time or face loosing a week s paycheck   but the most common problem that has appeared in every truck that they have own is the sudden stalling out in traffic   push the gas pedal and the truck just stalls out and dies   rather than go forward   the trucks can never be trusted to go into first gear and leap forward with any amount of speed safely my advice is to talk with long time truck owners and way the pros and cons heavily before buying a truck that you expect to perform for many years to come br br  
23,0,  i thought it was odd that the front and back brakes as well as the rotors all went out before hitting k miles   also   we had to call the ceo of our local dealer because their service center said that the factory warranty wouldn t cover the cost   the repair bill was     but the ceo saw it our way after much arguing   and we didn t have to pay it   i guess they didn t like us too much   because when we picked up the truck   there was bird poop all over the inside of the truck   and it had a flat tire   we owned a   f   offroad prior to this one   and like this truck   the window mechanism on the passenger side tends to go out early on   this truck has been in the shop   or   times since we ve had it   not quite   year old   just the deal with the brakes sucked   the radiator had to be replaced at k miles   and the transmission was leaking fluid like crazy too   it is a comfy truck with a lot of room   looks good   but the reason i won t buy another is simply because of the service   the crappy way we were treated     
24,0,  i was driving a   honda crx that was about to die   and needed something quickly   so i hit a dealer specializing in used police cars   figuring i d get something inexpensive and interesting   i picked up a   police package   formerly owned by the connecticut state police   since the car was only going to be driven a few hundred miles a week   price was the main concern when the car was running   it was a lot of fun   good acceleration   lots of   quot luxury quot   features that the honda didn t have   and interesting responses from other drivers   unfortunately   the bad outweighed the good the police package was the only crown vic in   with a carburetor   not only was it a carburetor   but an engineering nightmare known as a variable venturi   the one i had was going bad   the local dealer wouldn t touch it   saying that the best that they could do was replace it   at a cost of     i did manage to find a mechanic who specialized in them and only charged    to rebuild the one i had   eventually   all of the major systems on the car were replaced   one at a time   just to keep the car operating when it was running   the handling wasn t particularly good   the breaking was poor   and the ride was soft   i can t even imagine what a standard crown vic would drive like   the acceleration was awesome   but at less then   miles per gallon   stepping on the gas was an expensive proposition if you re looking for an inexpensive luxury car   don t stop off at the local used police car salesman   the sticker price isn t even close to what it will cost in the end br br  
25,0,  i just bought a used   crown victoria police interceptor and am not a very happy camper   i belong to a volunteer highway safety organization and was in the market for a new   used police car as my    taurus was on it s last legs   after spending several weeks searching all over trying to find a used crown vic police car to my liking and that did not break the bank i finally found one at a dealer located two hours away from my home   the dealer who specializes only in used police cars was highly recommended by a friend of mine who has bought three cars from him and has been very satisfied with the cars overall so   after two trips up to the dealer and looking at dozens of cars on the lot   i settled on a    crown vic police intercepter model with    miles on it and a rebuilt transmission   part of the catch was the price which was several thousand dollars less than i thought i d end up paying   this car seemed perfect in every sense for what i wanted and needed   the only problem was that i wasn t able to test drive it on the road because it hadn t been properly prepped   so i was limited to driving it around in the parking lot of the dealership   it seemed fine in the lot   but the lot and a road are two different dimensions when it comes to testing a car s handling   you may say that i should ve known better   but i figured that a car with a police package was supposed to handle well before making the final decision on the crown vic   the dealer suggested that i test drive a    caprice police car he just prepped for a sale latter that day   he mentioned that the caprices handle better than the crown vics   i took the caprice for a spin and the handling seemed nice and the engine was amazing   but   i had my heart set on the crown vic i ve just always liked the look of it much better   and figured that there would be little difference in handling between the caprice and the crown vic because after all   both cars had police packages   boy   was i ever wrong   the day i picked up my crown vic it had been completely checked over and prepped by the dealer   i was eager to take it for a spin on the open road to see how it handled before handing over the check   to my surprise the steering seemed unusually oversensitive and the car seemed to ride very awkwardly around bends   the dealer reassured me that   that was typical of the crown vics and it was possible that the car just needed an alignment   i figured that i d just have to get used to the different handling   so   i handed over the check and drove home with the my new   used crown vic   a few days later   i took it in to my trusted local mechanic to have it looked over with special attention to the steering s oversensitivity problem and my mechanic said everything seemed to have checked out okay   he couldn t find anything really wrong with the vehicle that might cause steering or handling problems and he came to the same conclusion as the dealer    that crown vics were just built that way well   now i feel kind of confused and upset because i had expected the crown vic   especially the police package   to handle much more nimbly overall   my    taurus with    miles on it   shot front shocks   a ball joint and tie rod about to go and power steering that gave out long ago still handled better for the most part than this crown vic   in a way i wish i had gotten the caprice   but i didn t know better at the time my advise to anyone considering purchasing a used crown vic police car   or for that matter any used car   is to test drive it thoroughly and see if you can live with it s handling   i ll have to try to learn to live with the crown vic s handling unless i choose to sell it which i m not quite ready to do yet   the reason being that in the last   hours i found some useful forums and sites on the internet that discuss problems with the crown vic police packages and some suggestions on correcting them   so to end on a little bit of a positive note   there still may be hope for this crown vic and me   but   i don t have a lot of free time in my life to devote to fine tuning a car to ride decently that should have been built that way to begin with   i will be far more careful next time before jumping into a car purchase based mostly on my preconceived conceptions and test driving limited to the parking lot   p s   one owner of the same year and version of my car responded to a message for help i posted on a used police car bulletin board and he suggested having the alignment done by a mechanic that is familiar with the special needs of a police package vehicle   he said that having the alignment done properly on his crown vic improved the handling enough so that he decided to hang on to it   i will update this review as soon as i have the alignment done on my car in the next week or so br br  
26,0,  the crown victoria is a breed that s siblings are dying fast   the only major competetors in it s category is the lincoln town car and the ill fated caprice classic   it s twin the mercury gran marquis shares many of the same characteristics as the crown vic   acceleration is very sluggish for a car of it s heft   the underpowered v   whines when the gas pedal is pushed   where it lack s in perofrmance it is justified by the comfort and roominess   all ergonomics are well placed and simple   this car is designed for the grandma that hates   quot all those gadgets quot   it s forward bench seat is comfortable and squishy   but firm enough to support your grandma s aching hips   if you are still in your prime years i would stay away from this car unless you like the bulky fleet car look     
27,0,  i purchased a used   high top with all the toys   t v   vcr   nintendo   remotes   queen size fold down bed   built in oak cabinets   built in coolers   all the goodies of the tiarra package   it was absolutely beautiful   i purchased it with the intention of enjoying it while traveling to florida from ohio   never did make it though   you see   it didn t like warm weather for some reason   it stalled every single time the temperature outside reached   or higher   i would have to pull over to the side of the road and wait about   min   then go on my way again for another hour or so before it would stall again   i had it to   shops which all said it was fine and no dealer within miles believed a word i said   i replaced computer components x   over    of my own money   and the problem never went away   i replaced brakes on it as often as i changed the oil   i wanted badly to sell the van but felt aweful at the idea of someone else getting as stuck with it as i was   i finally traded it in for a new van and the day i did   everything in it shorted out   the t v   wouldn t work   the vcr wouldn t work   the seats wouldn t move   and yet all the fuses were tested and checked out to be fine   the service men at   shops that day told me they could find no reason whatsoever for the things not being perfectly normal because it showed power going to all areas as if totally normal   what s worse though was the lousy   mpg i got   it was terribly expensive to drive   to insure   and to keep up   too bad too it was so beautiful br br  
28,0,  if you have a   econoline van and bought the vehicle used as i did you will find that the dealer or the factory will not be of any assistance to you if you find that the paint on the horizontal surfaces is falling off   i purchased the vehicle in   and within a year the paint started to delaminate from the body and even though there was a   secret recall    this is a factory related defect confirmed by internal service bulletin        quot microchecking quot   sent to dealers in april   and covered under your   quot owner dialog quot   program   to date nothing has been resolved   i have written numerous letters to no avail   all i can say is if you are looking at products   caveat emptor     
29,0,  as i was driving off the lot in my   explorer   i thought for what i just paid   nothing could be better   i loved everything about it   and drove it everywhere just to be driving it   a few days later   i drove to meet my family   and saw another   explorer parked in the yard   turns out my sister had just bought her one   and we will get to hers later   first let me explain that i drive   hour to work   and then   hour back   when i want to go shopping or to the movies   that is another hour   so i put a lot of miles on my car   the good this car has awesome bright lights   comfortable seats   easy access   and i love the two power outlets   great for a crowd with cell phones   the bad not long after i got it   the sprayer on the back window did nt work   and soon after that the back window would nt stay open   one day   as i was pulling out into traffic   the transmission slipped   and i was nearly hit my oncoming traffic   and that lasted for about   months   oh yea   it probably took about three days when the plastic around the seat broke   at one time   when my friend was in the back   we had the biggest laugh because she could nt get out because the door was stuck   i did nt think it was too funny   since it has done that since   you just have to shove your body up against it to get it open   just the other day   when i would try to put the car in park   it would stop between the r and p   you have to take it down and then shove it back up   not problem once you get used to it   even though   i never used the luggage rack   the paint came off of it   and still is being very slow about replacing it now the sister s explorer when she drove hers   she loved it too   funny thing is   she loved it until about three weeks ago   when she   her husband   her daughter   and me   and my two kids   we had driven up to san antonio in two cars   and were coming back in one   her explorer didn t have the third seat   so that left us with one person without a seat   as we were leaving san antonio   there is a red light on the bottom of a hill   and as we were coming over the hill   we had to slam on the brakes and swerve to miss a car   well twice the explorer went on two wheels   and just as he almost got it under control   we slammed into a rock wall   and them spun around in an ending position of the back of the explorer against the rock wall   everyone in the front seat was ok   just sore from the airbags   everyone in the back seat was ok   except for the   in cut from the center consol   and the seat belt marks   and for me   the idiot who rode in the back of the car   with no seat   was thrown from the back glass   and surprisingly   ok   the explorer held up   but was impossible to control   which given the facts that he just slammed on the breaks and got over   not really jerking that hard   the car was not safe my recommendation is to not buy the explorer   unless you are a gambling person update   now the back left window does nt roll down   and i am over warranty   and the plastic on the back glass is cracking   and when i drive through holes    there is this horrible sweaking noise  
30,0,  i purchased my   taurus gl wagon in    so far   i have spent approximately     on repairs   the main problem with this car is the automatic transmission   it suddenly broke down and had to be rebuilt for the car to be drivable   and that repair cost me around      there have also been a few recalls on the taurus   in my opinion   this automobile wasn t built right in the first place   so wether you like it or not   there s going to be a big repair bill about every    months on the other hand   this is a very strong car   i used it to haul all of my belongings and furniture when i moved from my   bedroom apartment into my new house   this car is as strong as an ox   but unfortunately it s not very reliable   if my taurus didn t break down every once in a while   i would   with no doubt   keep this car for a good twenty years br br

32,0,  i bought a   f   in late    i also sold it in early    here are the reasons why i drove the truck off the lot in november of    i liked the way the f   looked   i thought it looked pretty tough   i also heard a few good things about them from my friends   i didn t exactly baby this truck   but i didn t drive it too hard   i maintained it well   i never beat it to the point where it might break   one day   as i knew inside it would it broke   only   months after i got it   i was driving through the snow   about a foot or so of it   and i put the truck in four wheel drive   i noticed right away that something was wrong   it was pulling hard to the left and was very hard to steer   i brought it right back to the dealer and they said i needed new hubs   that was the first thing that broke   in addition to that   the speedometer broke   most of the levers inside   including my seat levers   window roll down levers   and many others   began to just crack like twigs   i then realized this truck was made with very little craftsmanship   like any other i ever owned the f   also lacked the power i wanted in a full size pick up   it didn t get up and go like my old chevys used to   being very disappointed with this truck i sold it right after winter and bought myself a   chevy pick up   i was much more satisfied with that then i ever was with my br br  
33,0,  i bought this vehicle last year because i wanted a professional looking vehicle that i could drive to a construction site   i am an architect   i found this explorer and thought that this vehicle would be perfect for work and recreation   i definitely thought this was a good looking vehicle   black with dark tinted windows   power windows and locks and the smoothest   most luxurious ride out of the other trucks i have owned   and i have owned quite a few   things started to go wrong when i learned about the recalls   the truck was recalled for a hood latch   cruise control problems   and then the tires   i was fortunate in that i did not have the recalled firestone tires   i wanted bigger tires than the ones that came standard with the truck and paid extra for them   i consider myself lucky on that note   as soon as the warranty went out on the truck i started to have more problems   the truck would shake when it was running and i took it in to have it serviced   i paid roughly    for exhaust manifold gasket problems   i got it back and as i was leaving the service station   i went to turn the alarm back on from valet mode and the button fell off into the dashboard   four days later my wife gets stranded at a meeting because the truck would start and stall when she released the gas   not only was she stranded   but she was angry and embarrassed as well   she was going to lunch with friends and had to be rescued   she doesn t understand why her   year old jeep which has    miles has never left her stranded and an almost brand new truck with less than one quarter of the mileage has left us stranded three times   the truck was returned for a third time and another    later i drove it out of the service station   thirty minutes later i was stranded again   the truck wouldn t start and it had to be towed   this is where i am now   i have a truck payment   no truck   almost     in bills and i still don t know what is wrong with my truck or how much it will cost to fix it   i have a brake light that doesn t work   an alarm button that is inside the dashboard and the rear windshield wiper doesn t work as well   all for the small price of      where else can you get service like that   but     
34,0,  i must say when my cousin pulled up in her new stang convertible i was impressed at first sight and then i came to a quick realization   she d been taken for a ride   she bought the car wanting something that would be an attention grabber   well   i must say that the most attention that the car has received has been from the mechanic at the dealership   in the first weeks of owing the car the odometer stopped working   which is not a big problem but still lead her to a day without a car   then the anti theft light started to come on for no reason   along with the airbag light which made no sense   the biggest problem remains   the oil light   if you park the car on a hill the light comes on   a week or two ago the intake manifold cracked with left her with a big towing bill and another week and a half without a car   it also lacks in power that one would expect from a v   when you ride in the car you can here the top rattling whenever you hit the slightest bump   the overall ride is not smooth at all   with the upkeep expenses and the gas guzzler quality that these cars possess i would not recommend this to anyone unless you don t mind spending all of your time in a rental car br br  
35,0,  i bought a    red convertible   the car of my dreams   of course i go for looks and not practicality   i did not research the car fully and i wish i did now   where do i begin   to start after the first week of use i had to get the radiator fixed   i got a flat tire and the power steering was messed up   i have had various tune ups over the two years that i have had it   recently   all of the oxygen sensors went at the same time   and my trip mileage counter and odometer are busted   they do not accurately measure the mileage   for example   a   mile round trip turned into a   mile excursion   i drove for   hours total and all it measured was   miles   and of course   my service rep thinks i am crazy   especially since i am a young woman   and   he tells me that to fix this problem will cost me alot   since it not covered by my warrenty   on top of this   i have leak from the engine   of what i do not know   and a leak when it rains from the top   i recently drove my car in a blizzard in upstate ny   i can t tell you what a miserable experience i had   if you want a fun looking car then the is the way to go   but if you are looking for a practical car that is reliable i wouldn t suggest it     
36,0,  i had and lemon lawed a   gt convertible   cute car    extremely good looking   driving it was awful   front end shook   brakes wouldn t stop   did not stand behind their product and   instead   implied it was all in my head   yet they had no answer as to why the brakes failed while i was driving it   they couldn t answer why   different dealerships refused to do anything about my complaints   they never checked the brakes further then to look at them   they never tested the lines or anything else   they insisted my front end problems were tire related   yet i had   different sets of tires on the car in the space of   years    the final set had about    miles and were practically bald down from    on the first set   which still is less then goodyear s    suggested mileage and i drive my cars baby like i do not beat on them or do anything such as that that would wear tires down prematurely   i had   trans ams prior to that gt and guess what i got after i won the lemon law case and had to buy back the car   you guessed it    another pontiac trans am   we won t even mention the fact that the gt doesn t come anywhere close to the t a and z in horsepower   i could get the same horsepower in a   cylinder   door car   i e   the m   that is offering in their supposed   quot sports car quot     i consider the gt to be a sick joke   every time i was at there were numerous mustangs being brought in for repair    too many to make it worthwhile br br  
37,0,  my first car for college is likely to be the last i will ever own   driving the tempo is like being behind the wheel of a death wish   by the time i had gotten rid of the vehicle i had experienced all of the following replaced a cv joint lost my gas gauge and odometer   well it was still there just dead all interior lights malfunctioned blinker arm fell off driver side door failed to open from the inside driver side seat back went into a state of constant recline had scalding hot water dumped from the heating coil onto my foot    i ve never taken a shoe off going down the hi way mph so quickly in all my life lost a c lost heater lost defrost   in a snow storm i might add lost the muffler the tie rod snapped on a curve at mph causing the wheels to be perpendicular to one another consequently ripping the tire off of the wheel near death experience   i could have reached out the window as i was flying through the air and written my name on the near by telephone pole   before i landed in some farmers field ball joint snapped   looked like the wheel had decided to take nap   this was repaired for free the mechanic said after   repairs your th is free   radiator problems don t buy this vehicle   i repeat don t buy this vehicle   don t take a free tempo   after repairs its extremely expensive   i d call it a million dollar car br br  
38,0,  i have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic   interior   power   warranty   options   etc   points of view   i believe an important   but always neglected area   though is from an undercar point of view   and let me tell you   most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear   there are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there   but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion   and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision   if a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles   i hope to help you decide based on my experience   which one will be better for you from the standpoint of strength of   and reliability of   one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole   the steering and suspension system   the tempo was for years   one of the most popular cars on the market   it sold very well   and there were tempo s everywhere   suddenly tempo s weren t all that hot an item any more   there are many good explanations for this   and one of those i will let you in on right now   the suspensions on the tempo were exactly the same as was on the escort   absolute junk   having the constitution of the united states on my side is a very good thing   because there is not one redeeming quality about the suspension of the tempo   and if they could the and it s engineers would sue me for telling you this   first off nothing is greasable on the tempo   and the tie rods   both inner and outer wear out at a rapid rate   as do the lower ball joints   the design of the suspension is such that there is quite an angle from where the inner tie rods screw onto the steering rack   down to the steering knuckle   and this angle dictates that there will be a small contact area where the ball on the rack end of the inner tie rod contacts the bearing surface   the smaller the area the faster it will wear   that s just basic physics   and that is exactly what happens   if the engineers designed it where the inner tie rods were more horizontally mounted   there would be more surface area contacted and it would not wear as rapidly   but now it s too late   they are committed to mass production   even when you replace the factory unit with an after market part   the name s still the same   rapid wear   the lower ball joints are another sore spot   not greasable and prone to rapid wear   the ball joints on this car are integrated into the complete control arm   so when the ball joint portion wears you have to replace the complete lower control arm   this includes both the bushing on the strut rod   and the inner pivot bushing   this could really be a good thing though   because you will get new bushings when you replace the ball joint   but if you don t need bushings you have no choice   and at over    each retail   it is an expensive repair to replace both sides   there are many problems with other portions of the suspension on the tempo too   like strut mounts and bearings   but suffice it to say i am not at all recommending any of you to consider a used tempo   it just isn t worth it   even if you got one really cheap   and got all of the front end parts replaced with lifetime warranty after market parts   they will wear out due to extreme angles of operation   and even though the parts would be covered with proof of purchase   and receipt from the garage you got it done at   the labor would have to be covered by you and the hassle of another trip to the garage and being without your vehicle is enough to shy you away from one br br  
39,0,  i have now had the displeasure of owning two of these   quot vehicles quot   the first was my first car ever   then when someone ran a stop sign and hit me   totaling that one   my parents bought me another one   i ll say this   that was all the motivation i needed to save up the money on my own and by my own car the worst part about the tempo was that i had the same problems with both of them   the oil leaks   the muffler rusting out completely   the shocks rotting out   i even talked to a tech to ask him what would be causing my car to smoke and smell bad if it wasn t over heating   as soon as i told him it was a tempo   he diagnosed it as an oil leak   and then he asked me if my muffler had fallen off yet   it hadn t at the time but did less than a month later   that oil leak   a week after it started smoking   and on the day i had bought the part to fix it   caught on fire   that s right   my car caught on fire in my friend s driveway   thankfully since we were there to work on the car   we caught it before it did any damage other various problems i ve had between my two tempos include not starting without recharging the battery when the temperature dipped below    which happened with two separate batteries   so it was definitely the car   busted alternator   the seatbelt not working   which cost    to fix and was required by law   one window s not working and being stuck up   two windows getting stuck down   sucked in the rain   a radio that didn t shut off with the rest of the car and had to be turned off manually   and   my personal favorite   the electronic fuel door release just stopped working   but that ended up working out for the best because at the time   the door itself had stopped shutting   i beg you not to buy this car   life is too short to make all of the mistakes yourself   sometimes you need to learn from someone else s br br  
40,0,  i had a taurus that was a deathtrap so i went to a dealership to buy a new car   thinking that they d have to take it   i was planning on getting a escort gt but they only come in stick shifts   so the sales person steered me towards the tempo   the price was good and it was shiny new so i bought it   i also bought the extended k warranty   before the car hit k the fuel pump went   repaired for free   then the starter went   repaired for free   then it went again   free   the third time was less then   months after    and they wanted me to pay a    deductible   the boyfriend type man convinced them that they did not want to charge me   the next time my car wouldn t start   similar situation to when the starters went   a friend suggested i put the car in neutral and let it roll    and it started   from that point on i was constantly rolling and starting it   looks stupid when you re not on an incline   finally the rolling technique stops working and i tell the dealership to put in another starter   they keep it for the day and say there s nothing wrong with it   the starter is    and do i really want it   i take it home   and it promptly refuses to start   i take it to the local car repair shop and they diagnose a starter cellanoid and fix it for      i also asked the dealership to repair the stupid clicking noise the heater fan   which is constantly on   makes   this is     and   of course i ve already had this fixed   the guy just shrugs and says   quot oh   these things keep breaking quot   like that means i should just keep paying for it   the car just turned k so i m not happy about all of these repeat repairs   since i m the one paying for them now     
41,0,  i bought this   tempo in june of   for vehicle for business purposes   it s the worst vehicle i have every owned    and it s not even fixable   to date no one has been able to diagnose what is wrong with this lemon   i m scared to go anywhere with it   you have to carry a cell phone when you do drive it for when you break down   i drive about   km to work and on a hot day   i may not make it to work and won t make it home   during the hot weather   it breaks down about three times a week on my way home   and usually the breakdown point is within the same   km area i bought extended warranty which to date has covered very few of the repairs   in fact   they just can t find what is wrong with the car   it quits when it gets hot   just like an old fashioned vapour lock used to    sometimes will restart within ten minutes but sometimes takes a couple of hours   it quits or won t start when the weather is wet   not even right after a tune up   it quits when you go through a puddle and splash water on the lower part of the engine it may or may not start if the weather is cold   and the service engine light hardly ever goes off   the codes are of absolutely no assistance to diagnosing the problems   last summer it was in for service several times a month   usually on a tow truck   and it is still not fixed the gas mileage is just about the same as my old beater   f supercab    ton truck   in fact   the last trip from halifax to toronto was cheaper driving the truck than the trip   months before driving the   tempo   and the truck made it no problems   the car broke down christmas eve in montreal and then again in toronto on boxing day i buy a vehicle expecting to get at least ten years out of it   my husband has a lot of mechanics tickets for heavy equipment and maintains our vehicles very well   as soon as i finish paying off this lemon this summer   it s going   i still have a year s warranty left on it but i just can t afford the gas   the downtime and repairs that aren t covered nothing the dealer represented to me on this vehicle is true br br  
42,0,  i bought this car thinking it would be a deal   because my friend owns one   and he said it has been great for him   well little did i know how absolutely terrible this car is   it breaks down every   miles   gets bad gas mileage   and it has this odor it s awful   i can t turn on the heater   because the element has broken down   the radio hardly works   i can only listen to kozy     which is fine   but it gets really annoying   the steering wheel sticks   i have had to call my friends and family so many times to come pick me up from work so many times it s embarrassing   and noone will buy it off of me because unlike me   they are smart and can spy a lemon   i have even left the keys in the car in plain view in high hopes that someone would steal it   but they wouldn t even do that for me   this is seriously the worst car i have ever had     
43,0,  i have owned my   tempo now since july of   and though is usually a   quot name you can trust quot   it is not in this case   this car has had constant problems with the brakes   which no one can seem to fix   with the engine itself   an oil leak that i swear was there when it left the factory floor   bad locks   bad door handles i could go on and on and on i thought that this would be a reliable family type car   big enough for groceries   yet not so big that it would be hard to handle   instead i find that this car is so unreliable and shoddily made as far as i am concerned   it should never have been built in the first place   due to financial trouble   i got roped into paying     a week for five years for this lemon knowing what i know now   i would nt give the first month s worth of payments for this money pit br br  
44,0,  i bought a used   tempo gl for my wife   at first   it was a good car   but then   things went wrong   i had to put several hundred dollars into the car in the past   years   the air conditioner don t work   i had to replace the computer   and it s still running bad   i guess i should have got the hint when we found all the paperwork on the car and there where several receipts from mechanic work done on the car   and i have seen several tempo s on the side of the road broke down   i also know that tempo s have an exhaust leak problem   i ve seen a lot of tempo s that are very load because the muffler need to be replaced   the car is a nice car   don t get me wrong   but i think there are mechanical problems with it that make this car a bad choice br br  
45,0,  this was my first car   unfortunately it s been a huge problem for me   in less than a year   i have already invested at least half it s worth   the first day i drove it over   miles it locked up and was unable to drive   my tailpipe and my muffler have fallen off   my mileage has constantly gone done   averaging about   miles a gallon   i ve changed the brakes   times in less than a year   and they still squeak when i stop   when you are in park   it feels like you are in an earthquake   it rattles   no matter what   the central air is tricky   you have to press off every time you turn off the car or when you turn the air back on it will be on defrost   my right window on the passenger side doesn t even open   the throttle cable hangs up and makes it so sometimes that you can t even make it go over   miles an hour unles you re lucky enough to hit that big of a hill   the trunk doesn t open unless you have the car on   the doors stick and you have to repeatedly press unlock to get it to unlock   the scariest thing is that when you drive sometimes the door flies open   no matter where you are   the inter state or a rural road   even when it s locked   i wouldn t recomend this car   it s too unsafe   two nice things are the comfy seats    especially when you are waiting for someone   and the roomy trunk   dependable seekers   look else where br br  
46,0,  i bought a   tempo after my hyundai xl completely died   it was one of two tempos on the lot   and the only two cars in my budget range   i was in college and working two part time jobs   i purchased the extended warranty for almost    and never used it   which was stupid because the seatbelt motors went bad after i had the car for a week   so my automatic seatbelts wouldn t work and made loud noises trying to work   i just didn t have the time to go into the dealership because i was in classes and working constantly   needless to say   they are still broken   and it probably wouldn t have been covered anyway   my extended warranty only covered major body work   it worked fine right up until the point that my extended warranty ran out   of course   i wasted    and i still have nearly    to pay on the loan on a car that isn t worth     the driver side window has to be manually forced down   and the driver side rear window squeaks when being rolled down   another con is that the back windows only roll down half way a couple of months ago   the gas tank started leaking   at first   i could smell the gas   and once   my friend witnessed a couple of gallons just pouring out into the gutter   i took it to a repair shop   and they told me that nothing was wrong with the gas tank   but they did find out that my rear right brake needed work   that wasn t a surprise   my brakes had been causing me constant squeaking and grinding problems for over a year   i thought that my brake problems were solved   yeah right   previously   i had paid over    at midas to get them fixed   and they ended up worse than when i took them in   i took them back   and they reported that there was absolutely nothing wrong with them   my brakes make constant noise most of the time   but that day   they chose to remain quiet after i took it in   anyway   i told the repair shop to fix the brake   it cost me over     and i couldn t tell that there was a difference when i took it back   since then   i still have bad brakes   and while i no longer smell gas or witness gas leaking   i get about   miles to the gallon   my car has begun to make a rattling noise   and the trunk catch is broken   i have to tie my trunk down   i m a student   and i can t afford a car that causes me constant problems   i ve heard about other tempo owners who were constantly paying to repair brakes   shops will tell them that there is nothing wrong with them until the brakes have been damaged so much that the whole system needs to be replaced   there have also been numerous reports about gas tank problems and cars catching on fire because of leaks   i m not repairing anything on this car   i m getting rid of it   the only other good thing about it is that it has a lot of trunk room and plenty of back seat space   not that i get to use that space   no one wants to ride in my death trap  
47,0,  my family purchased this car after our   taurus station wagon went out   we thought   well   since that was a good car   why don t we try this one   our mechanic sold it to us   he had used it   months   since that time   a muffler has come out   the transmission has gone out   the door quit working   the windows quit   and other technicalities   our family has big   tall people   this car is not designed for big   tall people   it is for little people        we are getting rid of it   do not get this car   we have spent lots of money on repairs and you will too br br  
48,0,  this car would make a great pic nic table   or maybe a great fountain in the front yard if you gutted it out   this car would be absolutely great   just as long as you weren t driving it   i absolutely hate my tempo   it was a great car for the first day   and i still think the interior is rather comfortable not roomy by any means   but comfortable   this is a very minimalist car no special features   pretty basic interior   pretty sluggish   etc etc etc   it s only great feature is that it s a cheap car to fix   and fix you will do a lot   this car makes more noises than a synthesizer   unfortunately they don t sound as good   watch out for the harmonic balancer   this happened to me after the first month   basically it makes a sound like a jackhammer in the distance   especially when making a turn   apparently this problem is so common   that when i took it to the shop   the mechanic ran upto my car before i left it and told me i needed to replace my harmonic balancer   apparently stuck a very cheap one in the tempo that cracks on a regular basis   ok   back to the car buy a taurus instead   in fact   if you can   don t buy a   so   to reflect on what i ve just written   this is a bad car   a very very bad car   don t buy one   you wo nt be happy   unless you are a really twisted person br br  
49,0,  about a year ago i sold my   stx x   i had good reason to sell it   it was so incredibly unreliable   it was a four wheel drive regular cab short bed   it had a   speed manual transmission    l v   engine   am fm cassette   my was a nice looking off white with tan cloth interior and bucket seats with console   it was a very attractive truck   but constantly needed some kind of repair   literally every month something went wrong with it   my father had given it to me because he knew i needed a vehicle and he wanted something newer   it wasn t terribly old though   it had about    miles on it and ran great   my father had the truck since new   and pampered it   two weeks after he gave it to me   the engine started smoking really bad   i took it in to the local dealer   they said it needed pretty much all new seals and gaskets   a    repair   a couple of weeks after that   the a c stopped working   a    repair   a month after that   i accidentally pressed the four wheel drive button and it got stuck on   i took it back to the dealer   i was told that there was too much grease on the front hubs and it was causing the four wheel drive to stick   wrong   when i took it in for the third time to get the stupid four wheel drive fixed   i was told that it needed a new x engage disengage   this solved the problem   within a month of that happening   the clutch started slipping   but didn t bother fixing it because i had already put so much money in to it and couldn t afford the clutch   at about the same time   the speedometer stopped working occasionally   i don t know if poor reliability like this is normal for a truck or not   but i will never buy a truck again   not to mention that it was rediculously slow on the highway   you could floor the gas pedal without any acceleration   it got terrible gas mileage too   i only had it about six months during all of this before i traded it in for a car   don t consider a truck unless you absolutely need one   trucks tend to be slow accelerating   gas guzzling   and unsafe vehicles compared to cheaper cars     
50,0,  we bought this truck back in   from a woman in our community   we got it with less than    miles on it at the time   now it has nearly     sure   it drinks   and drips   loads of oil and isn t very good on gas milage anymore   but that truck is made like a timex   presently it smokes from the wore out muffler and some other place on the engine   i have to ride the breaks when i m at a red light   and it never ever wants to start when it s the least bit cold outside   but my little truck is paid for and it s never let me down   with all of its problems it s never cost over    at one time to repair   mostly it s just replacing of belts and filters   or adjusting the corborater   since this truck has lasted so long with its problems   i would consider buying another truck in the future   i can t really recommend the new since i know nothing about s quality now br br  
51,0,  i made a big mistake and bought a   taurus se   i used to work at a large dealership and thought i still had lots of friends at the dealership   so i went there to buy my car   when i bought the car it had   km on it   i thought the price was a good deal   but let me tell you it was no deal the car has shown well in safety tests   probably because its always in the shop and not on the road   and is quite comfortable and roomy in the front and trunk is large and can hold just about anything   rates it as dependable and reliable   well the people who rate the dependability and reliability of this model must not own one this car spends more time getting fixed then it does on the road   the dome light stays on whenever it feels like   the heater went   months after we bought it   the cable that runs form the steering column to the transmission snapped right after the   km warranty ran out   there are power surges when you slow down for lights or stop signs   but the biggest problem is that the car has less than   km and now the transmission has blown   even though i know a mechanic that charges me less than the going rate for labor   this repair is going to set me back approx      with the cost of car rental for   days   i can say however that the car rides nice and smooth and the steering so far has been good   it corners well and does not shake and shimmy at speeds of km or more   this vehicle gets good gas mileage and does not burn a lot of oil however the bad out weighs the good   for a domestic car the repair bills are quite costly and the parts are not as easy to get as you would think   with the time is spends in the shop and the cost to repair   it just is not worth it when i spoke with the dealership one of the sales guys laughed at me and said that the taurus is just not a good car   thanks for selling it to me not only that but the place that my mechanic sent the transmission said that he already has   taurus s   and newer that have the same problem unless you like to spend a lot of money and love to read the magazines and check out the guys at the shop i don t recommend this car to anyone   i know that i will be unloading mine as fast as possible what the say about   found on road dead or fix or repair daily   definitely applies to this model br br  
52,0,  update   after this epinion was posted   the car   having about    miles on it   had the transmission go out of it   the trans would refuse to go into gear   the cost of the repairs were estimated at    i do also know for a fact   that a close friend of mine who was a fan   had also had a   taurus   and his transmission went out at about    miles   apparently   according to the dealership   knows that this is a problem   but will not really do anything to help their customers   i definetally can not reccomend anyone buying this kind of car original epinion while thankfully   i did not buy the taurus   i still must drive it   my fiancee has this car as her car   it being a   model   while the    l v has some pep   the rest of the car is all down hill from there   the exterior of the car is like the title said   a fish car   altho for   realized their blunder   and tried to remedy the situation   the round rear window and the low trunk looks very strange to me   the taurus s sister   the sable looks a bit better from the front   using some chrome accents   inside   there are a host of things that annoy both of us   first off is s attempt at stationary lumbar support   when you sit in either of the front seats   your upper torso   namely your shoulders are pushed forward in an awkward position   not comfortable at all   the power lumbar in an upper model may fix this   secondly   the   control pod   with the radio and climate controls is not well designed   first   the buttons are all similar   and close together   somewhat so making it hard to distinguish radio controls from climate controls   the rd thing   is that there is no good place for a portable cd player to sit   my first choice would be an aftermarket stereo   but it s a car   and the control pod limits the modifications that can be done to the stereo   so   we use the portable cd player in the car   in order to have a place to put the cd player   the armrest must be in the folded out position   which requires the use of a corded y adaptor for ciggaret lighter power   because the armest when open   will not allow the ashtray to be open   aside from these things   the taurus is a rather safe car   but   if it were my money   i think that i could find a better suited car for the money that it is worth
53,0,  when we bought this car we did not want to spend a lot of money   ours was the last of its kind on the lot   it s a    g   but we bought it new in     it s stripped down   it has an am fm stereo and power windows   but no power locks or trunk release from inside the vehicle    a definite negative   still   these issues were minor because we wanted a car with a good safety rating   and we needed a car that was relatively inexpensive   this car was both we felt we were ok because it was new and came with the manufacturer s warranty   year     bumper to bumper   we used the car primarily for cross country trips and it did quite well   but on our third trip   we noticed the transmission was very tough to shift into gear   we had    miles on the car   the dealer found that the transmission had a problem   and only fixed the portion that was causing the problem   some seals were bad   as well as some valves   i asked why they wouldn t replace the entire transmission   considering it failed after only    miles   he said they only repair the portions that failed   in my opinion   i have a defective transmission which is begging to fail and strand me   or my wife and kids   in the middle of nowhere   was not willing to replace the transmission   despite this major flaw   the transmission is still not working perfectly and the warranty has expired   the car has been fairly reliable   during the three years we ve owned it   we ve barely put    miles on it   all of the repairs done were covered by the warranty   see below   i won t say it was   free   however   because each time i took the car in for repairs   they kept the car all day and i had to make other arrangements to get to work     transmission    pseudo repaired    it works   but not perfectly    power steering pump    noisy and replaced    emissions switch    a light came on in the dash informing us to check the engine   had to go to a dealer   we were on vacation   and spent the morning there while the switch was replaced    weather stripping on passenger front door    seal was broken between the door and the car body    replaced
54,0,  since    when i bought my    taurus   i have gotten to know my auto repair man very well   i have spent more time waiting in his shop in the past few years than i have going out with my husband   this car not only has given me a ton of trouble   but it s always strange odd trouble   car troubles that no one has ever heard about   last year i had to replace the engine because i drove through a puddle   that s right   the engine   sometimes when i step on the brakes the rear defrost goes on   of course this is just the mild trouble other problems i ve had   include the interior lights never going out   causing the battery to die   sometimes the alarm goes off   while i m driving   i truly believe i could make a horror movie comparable to the amityville horror house move about this car   my point is   save yourself trouble and hassle and run don t walk away from that dealership br br  
55,0,  taurus   have to be the worse car on the road today mechanically   sure   it looked good   but not worth all the money you need to sink in to it to keep it running   i put a total of   transmissions in mine and even that one was on it way out when i traded it in   there are also   safety issues i have with this car   first one is the engine mounts fell off   yes   my engine flew to the ground just about   they did recallit butnot until after ipaid that expense   the second and more serious flaw is that on a   degree turn into oncoming traffic   the turn signal switch that is inside the steering column broke off inside causing me to loose control of all steering   they still have not recalled this even though i know many people this happened to and they called it in also   i would never purchase a taurus again   heck   i would nt even take one for free unless i owned a money tree br br  
56,0,  i will never buy a vehicle again   i bought my   year old taurus from a reputable dealer   they told us that the car was just off of a lease   it had never been in an accident   the brakes were new and we still would have one year left on the original warranty   we bought it the car and the story   the brakes had to be totally redone after just two months   the reason for the rust and corrosion was the car had   quot stood quot   too long   yeah on their lot   then there s the transmission   first it was a hard shift on my automatic transmission   they adjusted the computer   then it needed still more adjustment   this dealer couldn t fit us in for   weeks   so we tried another dealer   they wouldn t touch a car that another dealer had already touched   we called s   number   they said the second dealer had to take us   the dealer then said they were too busy to get us in   we called the original dealer and asked for a loaner as we didn t want to damage the transmission   they refused and said we weren t damaging the car   when they did finally see our car they said we needed a whole new transmission   they then said that the warranty had run out and besides it must have been something we did   we ve since learned that taurus has a history of transmission problems and obviously don t back their product   never ever again br br  
57,0,  in early   i purchased a   taurus sho program car from my local dealer   the car had been purchased and used by as a   quot junior executive quot   automobile   whatever that means   the vehicle itself was in great shape with only k miles on it   so my wife and i figured   quot hey   it s practically new quot   the car was back into the shop within the first two weeks to have the   quot football quot   replaced   the tape deck unit was not functioning properly   so the entire radio climate control unit had to be replaced   within a month   the car had k miles on it at this point   i had to take it back to the dealer to have the drivers side rear window replaced   it seemed a bit early to have this replaced   but it was under warranty so i didn t complain too much   things seemed to go fine for about three weeks   when the cd changer wouldn t register that there were any cds and wouldn t release the cd cartridge   this problem took about   visits    different cd units and the course of six months to finally get straighten   in the mean time   while visiting family in iowa at christmas time   i accidentally pressed the sunroof   quot tilt quot   button while looking for the map light   in the dark of course   the sunroof then refused to close   it took about   minutes of me standing in   inches of snow   and my wife trying from the inside to get the sunroof closed    to this day   the sunroof still doesn t close everytime you press the close button   upon our return   we once again took the car to the dealer for warranty repairs   a few months passed with no further problems from the car   everything seemed to work properly   one afternoon while leaving on another trip to charlotte   about   hours i took the car through one of these gas station car washes   when the sunroof leaked water on my wife   upon further inspection   we found that   while being closed flush on the drivers side   the passenger side of the sunroof failed to close the entire way   leaving about an    quot   gap   i stopped by the dealer   set up an appointment and we proceeded on our way   when we arrived in charlotte   we checked into our hotel and decided to grab a bite to eat before the concert   we drove maybe fifteen minutes from the hotel to a cafe   we spent about another    minutes eating   when i got back out to the car after eating   it was dead   nothing   nada   when i turned the ignition key   abosolutely nothing happened   the car didn t sound like it had a low battery   it didn t make any sound   i had to wait for about and hour and a quater for a tow truck to come   then had to wait another hour while the local dealer supplied me with a rental car   it was a operated rental agency too   i was further informed that expected me to cover the costs of the rental   and that my car might not be ready the next day   since it was pm and that i would be charged to take the rental out of state   and then they expected me to return to charlotte to retreive my car   i was floored at the apathy of   especially when my service records showed the unacceptable number of time that the vehicle had been in the shop for warranty repairs   over   times in   months   i bit my tongue and rented a car   crown vic    a day   luckily my car was ready the next morning   prognosis   the battery had gone dead   i don t see how   when it happened out of the blue   i had had no problems starting the car at the hotel   and then   minutes later    of the driving and recharging the battery   and nothing pulling power fromt he battery when the car was turned off   the battery is all of the sudden dead   with no charge   it was at this point that i starting telephoning customer service   who most of the time were rude and told me they had no further interest in me or my vehicle problems   after   phone calls and   months of complaining   a call to a lawyer   and hassling with the local dealer   who all they wanted to do was trade in this car and sell me another one   finally gave me a k mile warranty on my car   it took long enough for to show any signs of customer service   i was very diasappointed in the way that handled the situation   i expect that cars have some problems   but it seemd to me that   times for warranty repair in   months on a car with less that k miles was a bit unacceptable   so far   knock on wood   the car hasn t been in for anything other than routine maitenance   oil   brakes   etc in about   months or so   maybe the problems have worked themselves out   i can not recommend the sho version of this car to anyone who doesn t have the time or patience to deal with a car that is constantly in the shop br br  
58,0,  could things get any worse i loved how it looked   after that it was all down hill   besides the neat oval theme there is nothing about this car i liked   first problem was a short in the steering column   ever time you turn right the radio would shut off   then as i drove home from a long vacation   at night   made a right hand turn and the headlights shorted out    we ended up sleeping at a rest stop until the sun came up and comfort is not included with the oval theme   then i had problems with the tranny slipping and when you put it in reverse none of the electrical worked   and to think this all happened before i could make my first loan payment br br  
59,0,  we bought our   taurus used in    it had    miles on it and was the gl edition   unfortunately we were looking forward to getting another crown victoria but none were in our price range   as a whole the car performs well   it started everytime you wanted it to and did great in the snow   while driving around in suburban areas the car is a dream   it s a smooth ride   quite quiet   and the car itself has no trouble   however once you hit try to go on the highway things get a bit shakey   in the beginning it seemed hard to get the car to cruising speed   once at cruising speed things cool down a bit   but try to accelerate from cruising speed and the car will give out quite a shudder   this isn t the best car to be taking on long highway trips   other than that the car will perform well   next there is the interior   all the radio   a c and heating controls are in one area which makes it very easy to memorize   the dashboard is arranged in an orderly fashion   the seats are very comfortable although the drives seat could have more lumbar support   as a whole the interior is very roomy   there is enough room for me being   feet to sit in the front and my friend of the same height to sit in the back without us having our knees at our ears   unfortunately much of the interiors moving parts were made of plastic which broke of when over used   as a whole this car was ok   i never got used to how many miles to the gallon you could get in the taurus and the stuff you could fit in it   although towards k miles this car started needing expensive repairs it lived through a trip to washington dc and my mother who runs child day care in our house and used it many times to transport them   for this cars performance i wish we had gotten another crown victoria we still our   one which has    miles and still out performs the taurus
60,0,  i bought my   taurus lx from tom wood in indianapolis in april of    it was a demo and had    miles on it   listing for      i paid     for it   i asked the dealer twice to provide an owner s manual   none was ever provided so i switched dealers to capital city   i have had the taurus in the shop many times for non routine items   including   the cigarette plug broke   the overdrive switch broke   a component in the steering linkage failed   and the stereo is garbage   let me tell you about the    mach   radio is so proud of   it has intermittent static in the front speakers   and i have taken it to capital city five times to be repaired   the static is still there   the service department will not replace the stereo because they are afraid will charge them for the item if it tests ok at   in the meantime   both and capital city have ensured that my wife s next car will be a daimler chrysler   in fairness   i have a that is flawless   but my taurus is a piece of junk   i called to have them tell the dealership to fix the problem   and they gave me the runaround   goodbye   hello chrysler m     
61,0,  i honestly can t complain about the engine or transmission or any other major component of my   taurus gl   it has always gotten me where i need to go and has always started up in the morning   etc   however   about    miles after my    mile warranty expired   all sorts of things started to go awry   first   the passenger side window   automatic   of course   stopped rolling down   the driver s side went soon after that   and   now   none of my windows roll down   when you get into the car   the little light showing that a door is ajar remains on along with the dome light and all other interior lights   it s quite embarrassing driving down the highway at night with your car lit up like times square the parts   from what we have discovered   are only available through   which means big money   so   my husband messed with it until he got a couple of the windows working   i m still waiting for the dome light to go out or the battery to run down first   i m anxious to trade this baby in before anything else happens br br  
62,0,   the   taurus   was now in its nd generation   many car companies for   had revised their sedans to look more aerodynamic   so had to do something to stay on top in the style department   unfortunately this attempt resulted in a more blase look   the   taurus   while improved in some areas   never made it past st base in other areas    the   taurus   is not much different than the   models   the    liter    horse powered engine is finally dropped   but there still is an anemic   horsepower    vulcan v as its base engine   the   also weighs more than its predecessor   tipping the scales for the first time over   lbs   the next engine is the essex    engine   it too has   horsepower   but unlike the vulcan    it gets all its power at a much lower rpm   and has more torque   lb ft   the top of the line engine is the    dohc engine that was built partly by   and mostly by yamaha in japan   this engine cranks out an impressive   horsepower   and will burn rubber if you don t watch your right foot at a stop light   this engine unfortunately is only available in the top of the line   sho   models   and they only come with a   speed manual for this year   the axod transmission still   after thousands of complaints   comes in the gl and lx models with the ohv    and    engine   obviously did not listen to their customers very well i driving impressions i    t he lx equipped with the    is what most of the critics called   anemic    boring   and just   plain sad   this lack of power problem was obviously an issue that i did not share alone   this car not only was slow in the lightweight models of the mid s   but for   it s even slower with the added weight and no increase in engine power   the   taurus   of course is not a race car   however shouldn t   acceleration   onto the freeway at a decent pace be a standard amenity in an almost     family car   i think so   remember   when these cars were new they were not exactly cheap   some lx models were as much as      a good engine   with adequate power is not asking too much   is it   my test car   a   lx only had    miles on it   but felt like it had much more   there were tears in the headliner and vanity mirrors   the carpet was worn   the back seat had tears in the cheap leather   this car looked as though it had been through the war   there was even a time while accelerating up hill that the transmission totally slipped out of gear   i had to shift to neutral then back to d   after letting off of the gas pedal   the transmission let itself go back into high gear   and i resumed my way up the hill at around   mph on the freeway   very dangerous when the speed limit is    but i had no choice i interior accommodation i   the   interior   is not too bad   i ve never personally been in a   taurus when it was brand new   lets see   in   i was around   years old   but i can imagine what this car probably looked like   the leather probably looked plush   the headliner fitted like a nice pair of leather pants   and the transmission as silky smooth as my skin   that s me trying to be funny   anyway enough about probably s   this car is now   years old and it is pretty darn close to what many would consider junk   the interior does boast tons of room   trunk room included   there is   way power seats with lumbar support as an option for the lx   leather   a cold ac   an optional electronic dash   electric antenna    mph bumpers   front air bags   finally   abs is an option   the   speaker sound system probably would have been good   but it didn t work so i can t comment    exterior innovation i   the   exterior   looks much like the st generation s   the rear looks a little more square   there is modified tail lights and head lights   body colored bumpers and door handles   more attractive stock rims   and paint has been revised so it doesn t wash off as easy as the previous st generation models   when i say   wash off   in a number of cases this actually happened with first generation taurus i price i   the   price   for a   lx taurus will cost you around    dollars   in many cases these cars are being given away   or close to it    other cars to consider b i    intreped    eagle vision    lumina   a href content   epinions content   a    my review    honda accord    toyota camry    corsica    plymouth acclaim    dynasty    bmw   series    thunderbird   happy car shopping  
63,0,  my   taurus has    miles on it and is ready for the junk heap   it is just not a well built car   i purchased it in   for      and at the time it had only    miles on it   no the odometer had not been turned back   since then i have put untold amounts of money into this lemon and it is   nevertheless   on its last legs the radiator has been replaced twice as have the cooling fan and hoses   the brakes have been replaced twice in there entirety because brakes do not have the tell tale squeal feature to inform one that the pads are becoming thin   thus   you find out they are bad when you start to hear metal grinding at which time you realize you are about to owe an extra     just this year i blew both heads on the engine   needed a new battery   new engine mount   new sway bars   new struts   for the second time   new battery cables   new calipers   another new coolant fan   had to have my electric window fixed on driver s side when it froze and my transmission is shot but i haven t taken care of that yet   the only thing on this car that has been reliable is the body which has not rusted at all   and i live in ny with harsh winters and salt on the road   why do i still own this car   well i am lazy   i don t know about you but shopping for a new car is something i look forward to with the same zeal as root canal   it also is a process that requires many hours of time which i frankly do not have now you may be thinking that with all this repair i must have been very hard on the car   actually no   i garage the car usually   have relatively frequent oil changes and tune ups   and i don t drive like a maniac   the car is either built poorly   or has gremlins the   taurus has sluggish pep   and corners like a rhinoceros   there is also an annoying momentary hesitation when the gas pedal is pushed down   the brakes work fine between fixings and the car does have relatively ample trunk space   but the s cupholder is located directly below the radio so it is very hard to drink anything and change stations   also   the cupholder is incredibly poorly made   it has a thin hinged bar underneath that looks something like a   quot u quot   when you hit a bump that u sways forward   if you hit a few bumps it sways enough that it comes out from beneath the cup bottle and you have drink all over your legs   floor   seat and   in my case   my passport which is now partially stained purple and redolent of grape soda   another thing i find annoying   this is really a tangent as most cars have this feature   is that when you touch the electric window button the windows rolls down all the way automatically   whoever thought this up must not ever crack their windows which is the preferred degree i want them open   so what are the advantages of owning this car   well   as i m sure you are all aware   the taurus is one of the sleekest cars on the road with its sexy boxiness and sultry lack of curves   i find women often turn there head as i drive by   whistle and say   quot nice taurus quot    lt yeah right   there are no advantages to having this car that i can discern i would say   all in all   stay far   far away from this automobile br br  
64,0,  i purchased my   taurus in   based on my loan officer s opinion of what size loan i could handle   obviously   he didn t figure the maintenance costs into that estimate   in less than twenty four hours   literally   i found myself stranded on the side of a major highway   screeching into a pay phone that   yes   they most certainly would send a tow truck   the water pump was shot over the next seven months i got to know my mechanic very well   the transmission nearly fell out from under the car   and did manage to crack the planetary    planetary what i haven t a clue   but it cost    to replace   soon after i also replaced the heater coil   window   and the air conditioner    twice   in southern mississippi you have to have the ac   i hitched a ride to the mechanic so many times that i honestly can t remember every thing that had to be fixed or replaced during the last month of my ownership the transmission began slipping   again   and the wiring went completely nuts   i honestly don t know a single person who has purchased a used taurus   of any year   that didn t have major problems with the car   the car is very comfortable   and a dream to ride in   but you can never assume that you reach your destination   they re just not built to survive more than a few years br br  
65,0,  i purchased my eddie bauer expedition three months ago   i compared the tahoe and expedition head to head before making my decision   i hate to be a stick in the mud as everyone at epinions that has rated their expedition seems to really love them   but i personally think i may have blundered in not buying a tahoe what initially sold me on the expedition was the overall cost   my expedition was about    less than a comparable equipped tahoe lt   and i purchased it at a time when was offering a great apr on all expeditions   i secured a loan for     over   months   compared to gm s     the had more   gadgets   and my kids went nuts over the entertainment system with the flip down tv that came as a free option from on my particular model my expedition has the    v    i chose the    over the    for better fuel economy   or so i thought   the window sticker stated that my vehicle should get   city   and   highway   this couldn t be any further from the truth   with numbers like       i should average about    mpg overall   right   i average    mpg   thinking at first that the problem may be my driving   for a period i drove speed limits only   and attempted to monitor my take off s and such   and my mileage only improved by   mpg   this is my main beef with this vehicle   either i purchased a lemon   or is inappropriately labeling these vehicles   i d like to hear from other expedition owners to see if their expedition s had similar gas mileage claims one of my close friends purchased a chevy tahoe with a    v    he claims that he is averaging about   mpg   i drove a tahoe with this engine   and it is a powerhouse   even gm s smaller    seemed to have a lot more power than s    if you absolutely love the expedition and don t care about gas mileage   buy the    engine   it will get virtually the same mileage as the underpowered     and will make driving much more pleasurable   p s   if you do purchase an expedition or if you already own one   think about replacing your factory shocks with a pair of bilstein shocks   i did   and they made it handle    better   reducing it s rear end bounce and body lean  
66,0,  i always thought   windstar   was a dumb name   well   it s not looking so bad now that they ve updated the windstar and renamed it   freestar   why the new name   well   someone high up at decided it would be neat to begin all car model names with the letter   f   the and t bird get grandfathered   but all other car names that begin with a letter other than   f   will soon be history   why do this   well   beginning all suv names with the letter   e   seems to have worked well   also    windstar   had a lot of baggage    but apparently not so much to get rid of the   star   bit   the downside of this new strategy is that it seems to be resulting in some awful names   the upcoming mazda based   futura   isn t bad   but the upcoming large sedan   the   five hundred   makes no sense to me because there are no other cars whose names are numbers   and   freestar   what s that   at least if they name a car   freebird   they ll have a jingle ready to go aside from the new name   has made a number of changes to its minivan   the third row now folds honda style into the floor   a full battery of safety features is now available   including stability control and curtain airbags   the interior materials have been upgraded   and the   horsepower    liter v has been replaced by two engines   a   horsepower    and a   horsepower     both based on the     why bother upgrading the    to a     one reason might be to suggest that the problematic   head gasket blowing    is history   well   the basic engine is still here   but hopefully the    s weaknesses have been eliminated this model year has seen new minivans from toyota and nissan as well   reviewing the honda recently   i concluded that none of the existing vans was perfect   each had significant weaknesses   but i had not yet driven the new   i never thought much of the windstar   one i drove years ago felt much cruder than other minivans   but might the freestar somehow surprise me   i took one for a test drive to find out b styling   the styling of the windstar always looked awkward to me   something just was not right with the proportions   for the freestar most of the sheetmetal remains unchanged   the front fenders and hood are new   though   the new front end is more massive than the old ones and is cleanly styled much like s current range of suvs   with a large trapezoidal grille   thankfully the long side of the trapezoid is on top   with some windstars it has been on the bottom   suggesting a frown at any rate   the new front end seems to have done much to lend the van better proportions   the fender flares from the windstar remain   but they look better on the frestar s larger front fender   overall   the exterior styling of the freestar is not strikingly attractive on interesting   but it appears thoroughly tasteful   even somewhat handsome now   later in the model year optional   inch alloys will further improve the look of the van judging from the photos in the brochure   the toyota sienna is the new ugly queen in this segment the interior possesses little in the way of style   good or bad   unless you find the passat s interior stylish   because the freestar s interior is a blatant knock off of the vw sedan s   the basic forms are square   most notably the nearly square center stack   few curves are to be found   the instruments   with their chrome rings   are probably the nicest looking bit   most off putting is the fake wood in the sel trim line   the three lower trim lines   s   se   ses   have matte black on the center stack and a strip of faux aluminum dividing the darker upper part of the instrument panel from the lighter lower part   the rest of the interior is in the lighter shade   with the top of the line limited both pieces are faux wood   with the sel   however   only the strip is faux wood   it doesn t look so good   maybe the limited   with more of the stuff   will look better   sadly   if you want leather you need one of the top trim lines   so you ll be getting some faux wood with it aside from this bit of trim the quality of the interior is superior to the windstar s   the low gloss materials do not look luxurious   but do look durable   they aren t quite up to the passat s   but they were clearly an attempt in that direction compared to past fords   the leather has a thick   durable feel to it   the top of the dash is soft touch material   the lower part is hard plastic   typical of this class of vehicle   the various buttons feel a bit higher in quality than those of past fords   the controls are conventionally arranged   unlike the nissan there is nothing crazy here   overall   the appearance of the freestar s interior is at least mid pack   better than the nissan and gm   perhaps a bit nicer than the honda   and trailing only the toyota and maybe the chrysler   the latter comes across as classy overall   but does have some cheap bits    accommodations   the freestar at   inches is within an inch of most competitors   yet the interior is tighter than all other extended vans with the possible exception of gm s   it has been a while since i sat in the back of a gm minivan   the front seat is roomy enough   with good comfort   the driving position is not my favorite   as the bulky looking instrument panel is a half foot higher than the beltline   bottom of side windows   especially in a chrysler the view forward is much more expansive   but some people might prefer the more closed in feeling of the   as it might make them feel safer   as in the windstar the interior front door panels actually rise a few inches above the beltline   effectively reducing the side glass area   i suspect some market research lay behind this decision continues to offer a second   wide angle rearview mirror to keep tabs on the rear seats   a useful feature that toyota has copied the pedals in the minivan i drove were adjustable   with the pedals all the way back i had to position the seat all the way back   even though i m only     reducing rear passenger room   i like an arms outstretched driving position   but would likely compromise this when carrying adults in the back   the driver s seat itself is memorable for neither discomfort nor exceptional comfort   still   the front row is easily the best in the van the second row captain s chairs feel a little on the small side for adults and are a little too close to the floor to provide good thigh support   luckily these include build in armrests   for there is none on the door   get the bench   standard on the s   se   and ses   and i m not sure what passengers will do with their arms   the second row seats tumble forward to provide access to the third row   i found it nearly as easy to simply walk between the captain s chairs the third row is perhaps the most cramped of any extended length minivan   it sits low to the floor   providing no thigh support   and because of very thick sidewalls   the left one contains the rear a c   the shoulder room in this row is only   inches   more than a foot less than the second row and about a half foot less than you ll find in the rear seat of the typical midsize sedan   notably   the honda odyssey provides over ten inches more third row shoulder room   yet only two people sit in the s second row even with the bench   while three sit in the third row   i don t get it   legroom   or more specifically footroom   is also limited in the third row   the culprits are very thick inner pedestrals under the second row captain s chairs   between these pedestals there is only room for one foot to squeeze in   where should the second foot go   the second row seats adjust fore and aft a few inches to juggle legroom   however   although the seat moves the pedestals do not   so moving the seat doesn t help unless you move it so far up that third row passengers can put their feet on top of the pedestals   at that point the second row will have no legroom overall the freestar s rear seating and roominess is very disappointing   compared to the toyota sienna   it offers    inches less legroom in the front seats     inches less in the second row   and a huge    inches less in the third row   as moving seats back and forth shifts legroom from row to row   these numbers are cumulative   for a total legroom disadvantage of over ten inches   this despite the fact that the freestar is an inch longer than the toyota in both overall length and wheelbase the freestar s third row seat does stow into the deep well provided for it fairly easily   three clearly labelled steps are involved   one more than in the odyssey   the extra latch permits the seat to be rotated rearward   degrees to serve as a bench for tailgating while the van is parked   unlike in the nissan   the tether used to pull the third row into the well is long enough to extend outside the well   the split bench in the toyota is the easiest to stow   but the edges out the honda   and the nissan is by far the most difficult   and finger threatening   in the   unlike in the honda and nissan   the headrests do not have to be removed before stowing the seat   the downside is that they   and those in the second row   are not high enough in their lowest position to protect adults when the third row is in place the deep well can be used for cargo   it is a good size to hold grocery bags upright   preventing their contents from rolling about the entire floor   the maximum cargo volume    cubic feet   is about ten cubic feet shy of the extended minivan norm   probably those thick rear sidewalls again on the upper trim lines a center console is a    option   it isn t very tall   not even coming up to the level of the seat cushions   and contains only a sedan sized storage compartment   it is not very wide because the parking brake   like the windstar s   is between the front seats   the center consoles available in the chrysler and toyota vans are significantly larger   other storage compartments are located in the freestar s center stack   roof console   doors   and atop the center of the instrument panel   a fairly large glove compartment is also provided   there is plenty of storage aside from the optional console   but some people will still want it because of its handy location b on the road   the    liter s   peak horsepower trails all the gm vans     liter among extended length minivans   but it leads them all in midrange power   with   pounds feet of torque at a moderate   rpm   even the    produces   pounds feet   tying the chrysler    and leading all others   unlike the honda   toyota   and top line nissan   however   continues to use a four speed automatic   perhaps because its gearing is thus taller than the others   or because the revised engine still falls well short of honda s and toyota s in refinement   noise quality at full throttle   and willingness to rev   acceleration with the    feels just adequate   the japanese vans and especially the honda feel considerably quicker   that said   how quick does a minivan need to feel from behind the wheel the freestar feels larger and heavier than the competition   partly due to the relatively high instrument panel but also due to the chassis dynamics   the van understeers heavily in turns and generally communicates that it does not wish to be hurried   the steering is not overly light   unlike many past products   lean is moderate the payoff for this below average handling is excellent ride quality   this ride quality i suspect that s engineers derived their priorities from those of van buyers   i drove the freestar along a road full of chuckholes and very uneven expansion joints   cars generally ride poorly on this road   but in the freestar imperfections were heard only a little and felt even less   this ride quality was obtained through intelligent design   not simply through ultra soft suspension settings   as a result   the van remain composed over rough surfaces and did not bobble about b safety   like the windstar the freestar should ace crash tests   it offers traction control   stability control   front seat airbags   and curtain airbags in all three rows   as much safety equipment as can be found on any minivan   topping the others   the last as in the explorer is linked to a rollover sensor and functions as a canopy keeping people from hitting the ceiling in the event of such an accident   i doubt many minivans roll over   but if one did this would be good to have b pricing   the   price paid   listed below is the sticker price of the van i drove   to make the freestar more comparable to other minivans   especially the honda odyssey with its very limited feature flexibility   i will compare a windstar sel with leather   power sliding doors   side and side curtain airbags   traction control   stability control   and rear obstacle detection   the list price is     and the price after discount and rebate to about      heated seats and automatic temperature control are only available on the limited   which even after adjusting for major content runs about    more   those uninterested in the limited s two tone paint   turn signal indicators in the mirrors   message center   and so forth will be better off getting aftermarket seat heaters installed   those who love every last knick knack should of course get the limited note   currently in many regions the    package that includes stability control   traction control   and rear obstacle detection is free on limiteds and    on sels   i have included these discounts in my comparisons   the odyssey ex l lists for      likely because of the increased competition   honda increased prices only    from   and its dealers are now discounting these vans   but still not by much   edmunds suggests that the typical discount reduces the price to about      after adjusting for content differences   the honda lacks stability control   curtain airbags   adjustable pedals   and rear obstacle detection but has heated seats and automatic temperature control   the honda is about    more expensive   the honda is easily worth the extra money because of its superior powertrain   roomier interior   more comfortable rear seats   and less rapid depreciation the hot van is now the toyota sienna   the sienna s options are bundled much like the s   toyota s new system which puts everything into a huge number of packages is very confusing   but i waded through the descriptions to find the best one     of   xle packages   the list price of a sienna xle with package   and floormats is      and edmunds suggests no discounting   adjusting for equipment differences   sunshades   automatic climate control   heated seats    inch wheels   power liftgate   center console   jbl sound system   would narrow the gap by about      even with a     price disadvantage     with the limited   the toyota still seems the better buy   but the honda is better still the nissan quest sl is equipped between the toyota and the honda   it has curtain airbags   fold flat second row captain s chairs   rear obstacle detection   power passenger s seat   power liftgate   adjustable pedals   and fixed skylights in back rows   but it has no driver s side power slider and its automatic has only four speeds   it lists for      dealer discounts reduce this to around      adjusted for content the nissan is about    more than the   the nissan is a less refined vehicle with inferior interior materials   but it has a larger interior   many innovative features   and striking styling   so those who care about such things should check it out in reaction to the odyssey s relatively low prices   chrysler introduced value models of its minivans three years ago   a town    country ex with leather and side airbags lists for      the typical discount and a     rebate reduce this to about      the chrysler has a power passenger seat and power liftgate   and its third row does not fold flat   but is otherwise equipped like the honda   adjusted for equipment it is about    less expensive   the chrysler feels a bit more agile and is roomier   the has the trick third row   gm offers the least expensive extended minivans once discounts and rebates are taken into account    the kia sedona is cheaper still but is considerably smaller than the others   and at any rate only marginally competitive   the gm vans are less roomy and powerful than the others   but despite the oldest chassis here they handle fairly well   especially in their short wheelbase variants   their weakest area may be cheap looking interiors   the seats   appearance is especially disappointing   but leather helps a great deal   a fold flat third row is available   but only with cloth   a pontiac montana equipped as closely as possible to the above lists for      but the typical discount and a     rebate reduces this to about      adjusted for content the gm van is     less   for another    you can get a sport suspension complete with automatic leveling   a rarity in this class   i have not tested a gm van so equipped   so i can not evaluate this option   an old design but still worthy of consideration by those seeking the lowest price and good handling in an extended length van except for the toyota sienna on the high end and the gm vans on the low end   all of the extended length minivans are priced within a few hundred dollars of each other right now   all of them are arguably better buys than the   but only the honda is clearly a better choice i do not like how has made heated seats and automatic climate control   two popular features   available only on the knick knack laden limited   for those uninterested in all the bells and whistles the limited is about     less competitive than the sel   i also find it odd that the ses   with its slightly sportier exterior   can not be bought with many popular features   including leather b last words   the freestar was the only extended minivan i had not driven   i expected little based on my evaluation of the windstar   but was prepared to be surprised   i was not surprised   the freestar rides well and has a fairly nice interior   but its handling   room   and seat comfort are at best marginally competitive   i can not recommend this vehicle   the honda and chrysler seem the best products when price is considered   it so happens that both will be revised for    as i suggest in my odyssey review   if you can wait   then wait my reviews of related vehicles b a href content   chrysler town and country

67,0,  about a month ago   i purchased a new   explorer xlt sport    door not to be confused with the   door sport   major options i chose were leather   moonroof   and a   disc in dash cd player with   speakers   a few other nice touches that came with it are the auto headlamps and auto dimming rearview mirror   i didn t want the rd row seating and it was difficult to locate one that didn t have it   but my dealer came through and located one for me    i d rather spend the extra cash on leather instead of a rd row seat that s hardly ever going to be used   the sport package on the xlt upgrades the tires from    to    with different aluminum wheels   and includes side step boards   door handles that match the color of the vehicle   and platinum painted cladding and fender moldings   these cosmetic touches are minor but really do make the vehicle look a lot nicer   in fact   these features are also part of the much higher priced eddie bauer package i like the exterior styling of the explorer   it s simple yet tasteful   and not overly done with cheap looking plastic cladding or gimmicky stuff like that   it s not a hummer and doesn t pretend to be one   one exterior feature worth mentioning is the rear hatch   most suv s have a rear window that flips up in addition to the whole hatch opening   well the explore has this feature as well   but the window plus a portion of the door flips up which makes it easier to put stuff in the back since you don t have to raise a bag of groceries for example   above your shoulders to load through the opening   i am extremely pleased with the layout and quality of the materials of the interior   the quality of the leather is great   and the leather wrapped steering wheel feels solid   the gauges are nicely laid out   again nothing fancy   there is a compass and temperature display with the digital odometer   the cd player is mounted high on the dash   which i like   above the a c controls   there are   cup holders   an outlet to plug in a cellphone   and a very deep floor console that stores a lot of stuff   the pockets in the doors are spacious and formed so a large water bottle can fit   pretty cool   the audio system sounds awesome   and there are a lot of cool settings to change the output to suit different tastes and styles of music this suv rides so nicely that i have to remind myself it s not a car   of course   it doesn t ride as nice as a car   but it rides much nicer than any suv i ve ever been in before   it doesn t have that pick up truck feel that most suvs have   when you hit a bump   you don t bounce up and down for another   yards   the    tires really grip   and the month long snow storm that just fell where i live put the wd to the test   and this baby passed with flying colors   at first i was a bit skeptical about the hp v having enough power for an suv of this size   but that thing puts out enough torque to move it nicely and has a surprisingly nice growl to it   the size of the vehicle is nice   also   not too big   not too small   some friends have told me that they think the suv is huge   but i remind them that it s about a foot shorter in length than a taurus and the same width   and they are always surprised in general   i am very pleased with my explorer and think it was well worth every penny   i can t think of any one thing that i can complain about   as i mentioned   the gas mileage isn t great but it s better than i anticipated it to be   i always find it ridiculous when suv owners complain about gas mileage   if gas mileage is important to you   then don t buy an suv   to me   it s like a biker complaining about the safety of their motorcycle   anyway   before i get off on a rant quality appears to be job   at again  
68,0,  i recently wrote a review of the   explorer xlt   v   awd   i hate this car   which thank god   my lease is up this summer   i recently rode in a friends   explorer   xlt   v   awd   although made several minor improvements   i still think this auto is an overpriced piece of garbage   it is overpriced   underpowered   and is generally just a low quality   high maintenance suv   i have had many   many problems with my explorer   and my friend said the same thing   also   on top of all the problems   their service is terrible   i think if you are considering buying this auto   look elsewhere   i recommend looking at the jeep line   or go with an import   you ll be very happy you did br br  
69,0,  we have owned a couple aerostars   the   model had several flaws   the drivers seat was broken through normal wear and tear   the anti lock break notification light has never worked properly   yet there was never a recall or anything   and the worst aspect of both is that these two and most of these models i have seen   are more apt to rust then other vehicles   they are both have rusted out the bottom side panel between the front and rear tires   the   van has ran fairly well   however the   model has had numerous mechanical problems   many flaws have resulted from the mini vans   from the alternator not failing to a leaking gas tank   they also have shakey starters in them as well   and a fuel injected engine that will not start without pressing the gas pedal br br  
70,0,  we were fed up with the cost of repairing our old camper van so we set out to lease a truck   the    f   series appealed to us with a solid build   reasonable cost   and great looks   we got our new truck off the lot and within the first   days the transmission blew   apparently   someone hadn t installed a part properly   the warning lights came on first but the handbook did not direct us to stop driving    just recommended to get it in for servicing we ve had more trouble since   with those warning lights coming on without any other symptoms attached   the good news    we only have to keep the truck for three years and the problems are under warranty   the bad news    this truck spends as much time in the shop as our   year old camper van    it s hard to go camping when it breaks down   very disappointing br br  
71,0,  i have worked in the automobile manufacturing business most of my adult life   no one has more stingent quality standards to uphold than   i have supplied parts to every domestice manufacturer you can name   i have owned a for   years and now have a     x   i have loved both trucks   especially the   is built very solidly   when the door shuts it shuts to a great fit   you can hear it on the new   i am not sure i like the new body   i liked the look of the pre   trucks esp the    the area i know live in seems to be gm truck land   my friends that all drive trucks prefer the gm   by far   then the with the ram being close to the   there are more gms in this area then fords and rams put together   my friends report that they prefer the gms for these reasons   styling   do not like the body look of   or ram   perceived reliablity   fords seem to have the reputation of using much more gas per relative engine size   as the gms   all full size pickups are very expensive   most around here are xs   and gm is the most   slightly   however gms seem to hold their resale value and are worth much more worth the value   in this area if i was buying a brand new truck   at present it would be a gm     
72,0,  i have a   f   x with   eng   and c trans   in   miles i have lost both exhaust manifolds due to leakage   the transmission went out a spark plug rusted into the head and broke off the calipars have stuck causing poor braking the paint white vehicle developes small rust spots on it and mileage is   mph at best the service writer at told me that has had a problem for years with exhaust manifolds especially on   eng her own mid s developed the same rust problems when i bought the truck i told salesman i was going to use it as a tow vehicle   i tow a lb trailer and this eng trans combination with    gears has all it can handle   must be doing better with the newer super duties   on yah i was told by the dealer that has now fixed the premature problems with exhaust manifolds they do not use that eng   anymore   good fix     
73,0,  i don t even know where to begin   this car   while i had it   had so many problems   it seemed like everyday   there was another problem   first of all   to be fair i ll list the good parts about this car   its    liter h o   engine does produce a lot of power for a small engine   i have actually beaten v chevy s and fords off the line   and it cruises with no problem at high speeds   that s probably about the only good thing about this car   the car itself has a very bland boring design   it actually looks pretty ugly    don t ask me why i got it   the interior is very cramped and there are no back seats problems    leaking winshield and sunroof    car is so loud   you can t hear yourself think    when you turn the vent on   all you get is a smell of gasoline    interior smells horrible    handling stinks   and power steering squeaks when you turn    shocks and suspension are horrible   can feel every bump on the road    horrible gas mileage     mpg   and i thought this was supposed to be an economy car    frequent problem with the engine   overheating   burning and leaking oil    car spent more time in the mechanics garage than mine    half the options on the car failed   cruise control   ac   etc   ok   this is pretty much my message   stay away from this car   its not worth it   for     treat yourself to a vacation or something   you ll definitely need one after dealing with this car  
74,0,  while my   a href auto review c aac eedc prod   bmw is a   was being serviced i was given a rental for   hours via   a href content   enterprise a   in spite of my previous bad experience   this young man was very nice   although the situation was much different   and was giving the   women ahead of me choices   it appeared no one wanted to drive the   f    i grabbed it since we are rethinking our configuration of cars and i really don t like my husband s   a href auto review e a fdb prod   chevy s   pick up a b the car s features    this truck is the     door supercrew xlt   wheel drive styleside with an automatic transmission b   it has a    liter engine with   cylinders   this is a powerful   huge truck   the truck has a little more than    miles on it    remember it is a rental but in fantastic condition   i will attempt not to compare it with my bmw but i can t promise   i do have our chevy s   in mind   though these trucks are very different as well   the f has a   gallon gas tank with an estimated   gas mileage   of   miles per gallon in the city and   on the highway   it has so many features that are standard there aren t too many options that i would look for except perhaps heated seats   standard   not an inclusive list   includes automatic transmission   front independent suspension front stabilizer bar   clock   external temperature display   which i have on my bmw and really love   low fuel level warning   compass   and trailer wiring cargo tie downs   which we need because we tow a   foot travel trailer   a href content   sun lite a this truck has a   seating capacity of   people b   the front has a    split bench front seats which mean that the driver s seat is separate from the other two seats which are attached   the front driver s seat is also a little longer than the rest of the bench   a fantastic feature is   lumbar supports   for both the driver and the passenger via a round lever   it makes a huge difference   one reason i don t like the chevy is because it is so uncomfortable   i found the f to be quite comfortable there is cloth upholstery and in the car i am driving it is a soft material and in gray   what i had never seen is the compartment between the driver and the window passenger   if you only have   people in the front you can put down a compartment   i can t call it an arm rest because it really doesn t come out long enough to rest my arm   that holds cups and storage   this truck has quite a bit of   storage   except for the glove compartment   what looks huge is actually tiny once you open it   there is storage on the doors and on the roof for glasses and kleenex   note though that there is a   bump    it isn t huge like in a bucket seat car   where the middle passenger sits   the is so much head and leg room that comfort in the front isn t an issue    the back   has cup holders as well and a split bench   it is divided as in    and   rd   there are two head rests    rds of the back bench fold down but not all the way but enough to get to a place where there is a small holding compartment where the jack is kept   the other   rd seat does the same   there are also rear heating ducts the truck has remote power door locks   power windows   power mirrors   cruise control   front and rear volt power outlets   air conditioning   front and rear reading lights   dual illuminating vanity mirrors and a leather wrapped steering wheel   other specs include front head room     in   front hip room     in   front shoulder room     in   rear head room     in   rear shoulder room     in   rear hip room    in   front leg room    in   rear leg room     in   from edmunds i am driving a white truck   it looks nice in white   other colors are black   beige   red   burgundy   green   dark green   gray   dark gray   silver and a couple of shades of blue it has an am fm radio with a cassette player with   speakers and   watts of stereo output   the radio sounds terrific there are no side airbags   you may want to note   also please   note   that this truck is high   luckily it has handles near the   doors you can hold onto to lift yourself up   for many   though   the height of this truck will be a problem    how the car handles     the first thing i noticed when driving this truck which did not go away with time were the   bumps   i felt   i think the truck found every bump on the road or made up some on the way   that is a real negative for me because we drive for long periods of time and if we are spending this much money will spend a bit more for a vehicle that will tow and that won t get me car sick   the second thing i noticed was the   outside noise b   that seemed to diminish in time   of course it really didn t   i just noticed it less   i could   for example   use my cell phone s voice command without being told it was too noisy   the third thing i noticed was that it didn t   stop   like my bmw   ok i know i said i wouldn t compare   but this is a truck   it stops just like our chevy a bit too slowly for me   stepping hard on the brake will stop the truck immediately but just pushing on it will have it come to a slow stop   the fourth thing i noticed was the   steering b   considering how big this truck is it handles well   it corners much better than i expected   though i did move with the truck   for something this size i didn t expect the steering to handle so well   i easily passed cars that i was too close to and got into the lane again with no problem the fifth thing i noticed was the   acceleration b   ok it is a truck but with   cylinders i expect more power   i had to really give it gas to get up a hill at   miles an hour   i never feared for my life when merging onto the highway   there is enough pickup for me to say it accelerates well enough   i m just not used to having to put my foot down on the accelerator so hard to get it going   i could feel it go into gear as i accelerated as well    i could also feel the truck at   miles an hour b   i wasn t afraid of going to fast in this because it told me when we were above the speed limit    it shook a little bit   i had a maxima that did that and i don t like that   we travel in places where there are no speed limits so i d like to be able to do   without feeling it   the   safety   of this truck is not good according to hwysafety org vehicle ratings ce html summary lgpickup htm    the overall is poor as is the safety of your chest   head and neck   left foot is acceptable   right is marginal and the restraints   using a dummy   are poor    that is they don t keep you safe enough   the standard basic   warranty   including the drivetrain and roadside assistance is   years or    miles   the warranty for rust is   years   this is one of the worse warranties i have seen    at least comparing it to cars b in summary     i have said many times that if i looked at the crash tests on vehicles i probably wouldn t get into one   but these letters   p poor   are glaring   can i not recommend a truck based on that alone   perhaps but there are other reasons i can t recommend it   i love the lumbar support   though why it is manual i don t know when everything is power   then again in my bmw my seat lever is manual in spite of other things being power   among the things mentioned    the bumps   the noise   the fact that the middle person in the front has a bump under their legs   does that make it a   seater then   really   the fact that the acceleration isn t what i would like nor is the ability to stop   and the climb up it will get   stars since i like it better than my chevy which i don t recommend either   so it is an average truck   i am sure there are better   i love the   doors and the    pound towing capability which is what we need   but other than that   i know i ll look elsewhere if you have any questions about this car   feel free to e mail me   other car reviews i have written include    a href content     bmwi a a

75,0,  the expedition is one in a long list of truck based suv s   it s basically a short wheelbase f   with a steel roof in back instead of a bed   and a rear seat or two   so   despite their bulk   and popular misconception   they re actually not as unwieldy as your typical extended cab pickup is   because of the shorter wheelbase   also tosses in a few minor luxury features and softens the suspension to differentiate it from the pickup and also to somehow justify the whopping     price differential   expensive rear seats and roof   aren t they here are my impressions on the expedition exterior styling   while not glamourous or sexy   the styling works   it s a bit top heavy   due to the cargo maximizing design   and the wheels are a bit narrowly offset   with more body overhang than i d like   but who are we kidding   you re hauling around babyseats in the back   you won t be crusing the boulevard in this suv   interior   much like the f    it s functional   though it retains some of it s truck based look and feel   buttons are large and well placed   the guages are easy to read   and the center console is huge and very useful   cupholders are fine   which is one of my   quot must haves quot   interior materials are tasteful   better than the chevy tahoe   but there is still a somewhat plasticy look you have to pay     for an suv to avoid   my main problem with the interior   and this vehicle in general   is s incredibly uncomfortable seats and seating position   i am    quot   and can not seem to find a position which does not induce severe discomfort after a minute or two   the seat back is too hard   and there is a lack of proper side bolstering to hold you in when the body rolls in turns and roll it does   when i get the seat set where my legs are happy   i can t reach the wheel easily   this causes major back pain from overreaching   and when i get the seat set so my hands feel right   my knees feel crowded under the dash   the   models have been improved somewhat with adjustable pedals and improved seat materials   but they are still not the greatest   be sure to test drive the expedition well before buying   you may regret it if you can t get comfortable   rear seat room is cavernous   with plenty of room to put in car seats and full sized passengers   three accross seating is acceptable   at least for short trips   the rd row seats are a weak point   however   they come in handy when hauling large groups   but are best suited for children   the problem   as with most rd row seats   is that though they re best suited for small kids   it s hard to get the very small kids back there and buckled in   so again   it s best for occasional use   buy a minivan if you are always hauling a team around   the a c and stereo systems are acceptable   though nothing special   i would suggest aftermarket upgrading if you are an audiophile and skipping the included upgraded cd system   ride handling braking   this is never the strong point of an suv   but the expedition has a smooth ride   due to its soft springs and suspension setting   wind noise is acceptable   but handling suffers   at least on wd models   due to the excessive body roll   this is a subjective thing   but you tend to wallow in turns and it limits your ability to maneuver in emergency situations   braking is adequate   though it s no sports sedan   part of the safety factor of big suv s is negated by their inability to maneuver as quickly to actually avoid an accident   so drive within the vehicle s limits engine driveline   the   l v   is a tad underpowered by modern standards for a vehicle this size   but it certainly isn t a pig   the   l gets up and going faster   but adds to the cost and reduces fuel mileage slightly   if you re hauling a lot of gear and people   spring for the bigger engine   if you re choosing between a less opulently outfitted expedition and a loaded explorer   choose the expedition and the cheaper engine   it s a much better value   the transmission is smooth   with none of the lurching i ve found on chyrsler products   it s not in the class of a toyota tundra   however   but few other trucks and suv s are   when it comes to smoothness reliability safety expeditions have been fairly reliable   the one i ve spent time in has zero breakdowns or warranty problems in    miles   i would rank them above chrysler and gm products   though behind japanese and german makes   the dealer network ranks from great to pathetic   so ask around to find a good dealer   i have two excellent ones in my area   safety is a great reason to pay the extra money to get a full sized suv rather than a more practical compact     lbs of bulk and increased ride height goes a long way in protecting your family in a crash   expeditions have not been tested   but the similar f   has outstanding crash test results   some of the best around   in fact   missing are side and head protection airbags   but only the most high end cars had them when the expedition was introduced   expect to see them in the next re design   if you are looking for a minivan alternative and need seating for more than    the expedition is a good choice   the new tahoes have a slight advantage in the on the road experience   but i would be wary of their spotty reliablity   with the optional rd row seat   you can carry   on a long trip   but if you re like me and others i know   and can t get comfortable in the front seats   this vehicle is not the one for you   it s unfortunate   because this suv is a good value for the money so is the expedition really a beached whale   well   if you do not have a family or do not really need the extra space   there are some newer   smaller   better driving suv s on the market   they will be more nimble and cost less to operate   i am very impressed with the new acura suv   it s slightly more than a loaded expedition   but gives you a better   faster ride   more refinement   acura warranty and quality   and more maneuverability in parking lots   it s somewhat smaller   but the newer design means more safety features   side airbags   that somewhat cancel out the expedition s size advantage   if you need the size   but want more refinement   wait and check out the new toyota sequoia   not cheap   but resale value will probably be great   some other decent alternatives for those who do and do not require a full sized suv full sized or near chevy tahoe gmc yukon toyota sequoia   late   durango   smaller   but   seat capacity isuzu trooper    the best dollar value out there compact mid sized acura mdx lexus rx   escape nissan pathfinder br br  
76,0,  two years ago   i had been dreaming about owning one of those monsters i had been seeing on the roads   the expedition   i love big trucks and this one had just come out the year before   it looked classy   sporty and aggressive at the same time   so i went suv shopping   i drove the durango   the isuzu   and many others   many but the tahoe   i can not tell you why   maybe it was just the shape of it   it looked old   they had remaind he same for years   a big rectangular box on wheels well   i ended up leasing a brand new   eddie bauer expedition   i live in the south east where it never snows and i don t have time to go off road   so i decided to save money but getting the wd   this truck just has everyhting on it   awesome   speaker stereo   power everything   cd changer   turning signal integrated in the mirrors for aded safety   lit running board   third row seat   automatic lights   leater seats   power driver seat   etc   it is very very roomy expct for people seating in the third row seat   but let s not be too demanding   it   quot seemed quot   luxurious and safe and so big   i loved it   we had taken the    liter v whihc i highly recommend considering the size and weight of this truck   the standard   l has a hard time moving this truck in and out of traffic the   l is powerful and is enough   however   it is noisy   when you pus the pedal down the cabin fills with noise and it is quite disppointing for k luxuary car   after driving this truck for a year   and driving other cars and suvs   i quikcly became more and more disappointed   what i thought was luxury   was just a facade   plastic elements are of poor quality and are poorly assembled   there are too many large gaps betwee dashboard elements and doors   etc   second disappointment   after the excitment of buying the expedition was gone   was the lack of torque and power   drive an expdition   then a tahoe   and you ll understand what i am talking about   the chevy powerplant is a lot more powerful and efficient   it ll let you spin the wheels at a red light   the expedition is more like an   quot escargot quot   third and major disappointment is the ride mainly over bumps   holes   and the handling in curves   you might not realize it as a driver   but seat on the right side a few times and it ll become obvious   i was wondering why my wife kept comlaining about my driving   the truck bounces you all over the places when turing   braking a little hard   or drivig on older bumpy roads   it also tends to lie on its side when turning   a    dollar luxury suv should not bounce you so bad and force you to hold on tight ot the door handle and the dash board   unless you wnat a work out i do not feel as safe driving it now i have since driven a tahoe and ridden in a suburban   the engine is a lot more powerful and adequate for such a car   and the ride is a lot more comfortable finally   i will end saying that in a year i had to take my brand new k expediiton to the shop twice   thre parts broke in the sunroof    days without a car and the auto air valve broke make sure you ride the chevy trucks before giving up to the good looks of the expedition   and to the image of driving one good car hunting     
77,0,  the expedition is supposed to be a top of the notch vehicle   however   there are many little things that just bring down the whole vehicle   first of all there is no trunk space   if you have a car that is made to hold   people   there needs to be room to put all of their things   my family got the car because we have   people all of whom are involved in soccer   we need the large car to travel to our soccer games and tournaments   there is never room to put all of our bags   another problem is that when the seats are put down   they don t align properly   on long trips   it is so nice to be able to put down the seats and make it into a bed   but since the seats are uneven   the bed is very uncomfortable   another problem that just irks me is the windows   the back windows don t go down all the way   they go too low to be for child safety   you can t put your arms out of the window and they get an annoying dirt line on them that is hard to get rid of   if you haven t noticed i m speaking from the passengers point of view   but i have also driven it many times   the seats are rather hard and uncomfortable   i have a jeep grand cherokee which has extremely comfortable seats and the transition to the expedition is not a good one   the expedition does drive nicely   it shifts very smoothly   it has average gas mileage and is relatively smooth riding    except once when it hydroplaned on the interstate not good at all   all together i would not recommend the expedition   if you are buying as a car that you would like to be comfortable for your passengers   as i assume you are since you are buying a car made for eight   i would recommend something more like a suburban br br  
78,0,  my family has leased a   expedition eddie bauer version for   years now   we have been fairly happy with it considering there are   kids and   adults   we have had more than our fair share of problems with this   truck   which i will explain later on   this car is best used on the highway considering it gets horrible gas mileage in the city and its still not that great on the highway   i would suggest leasing this car instead of just plain buying it becuase you do nt want to buy this car and turn around and hate it like lots of people i know   there are several pluses to this car though    no one will ever cut you off or get in your way   and i mean never    very safe in crashes    good in wintry conditions such as snow but bad in ice since there is such a high center of gravity    seats     lots of storage space    fairly nice sound system    they are very inexpensive at the dealerships right now    removeable back seat now for the not so good things    insurance is sky high    horrible gas mileage    tons of mechanical problems    loud    drinks fall out of cup holders    antena gets scratched if you go in your garage so in about a year you have to spend money to get a new antena    vary hard to park    bad turning radius    possibility to flip over    cd player is in center counsol so you ca nt change cd s or anything while driving    hard to wash    very expensive to get repainted or get fixed now for the problems we had   windows got stuck and would not come up all the time during the summer    oil leaks constantly    winshield wipers wear out in about   months    paint peeled    tons of problems with our fule pump    leather on seats tor for no reason    winshield wiper on back window never worked and never will i suggest getting a smaller suv such as a cherokee or explorer  
79,0,  don t personally own a explorer   but can tell you it s not for me   i have ridden in a few in my time and i am not pleased at all   yes they may be roomy   yes they may have comfort options and extras   but not for me   personally   i am not all for extremely large vehicles   i believe barges should float on the water   not on four wheels taking up the roadway   granted   if you have a large family and need a sporty type utility vehicle   you may appreciate the roominess that the explorer has to offer   as a person who doesn t like not being able to see out of her personal car   i would not want to drive this   let alone attempt to back it up   park it   or heaven forbid   parallel park it   i wonder how many people have actually driven these monsterous crafts to take their driver s license exam in   i would speculate so bravely as to say that unless you drive a tractor trailer on a daily basis   you d probably fail the exam   personally know a mechanic who complains of working on these vehicles way too much   they are a busy operation and they see about    of these each week with many problems   don t consider them too dependable   for the price   i don t think i would be too pleased   if i were going to pay that kind of price for an automobile   i d just as soon go by a sports car   at least then i could see what was beside me   behind me   and yes   even in front of me     
80,0,  when my friends started to find out i was driving an expedition they all called me big   quot pimpin quot   shawn   cause the big suv s are supposedly   quot pimpin quot   cars   well when you look at them   yeah they are very nice in a monsterous way   they are hogs of the road   they need one of those signs on it that says oversized load   i don t like driving it cause its just too big   i always park it as far away from the other cars at parking lots cause i m afraid i might not be able to get out of the car   or worse yet not able to back it out of the parking spot   the worst part of the car is it s amazing ineffeciency with gas   i end up never useing the air conditioner   because the amount of money i m spending on gas is just so ludicrous   and it is taking it s toll on me   i live in southern california where the temperatures are soaring into unbearable levels   i can t complain about the amount of space the car has   it is very roomy   and you can fit like   people in it comfortably   this is defenitly a plus when your the designated driver at a pary or something of importance like that   if you have no need for the very large amount of space this car has   do not purchase it   however if you have to move around a bunch of kids every day   or you need a very large carpool   this is the car for you     
81,0,  we used to drive down the road and be jealous of all the people who were driving the new style so when we could afford one we bought it   it was sitting in the back lot   it was white and all the dirt had settled on it from sitting   with the shortage of mustangs around we were thrilled to find one but we couldn t figure out why it wasn t on the showroom floor   they didn t have any convertibles on display   only hard tops   it seems that south florida is the place for convertibles year round and that s what we wanted    later we had brand new convertible   cylinder   white top and white paint grey interior and   miles on it when we drove it off the lot   we were thrilled   it was our christmas present   eight days after we purchased our new car it was a rainy new years eve and i saw the car parked by the school   miles from home and nobody was in it   i thought someone had stolen it   a policeman drove by asking why the car was there   he thought it was stolen walking in the rain was my son and he said the car let out with a bunch of steam and the engine quit   so we had it towed to the dealership and they were closed but when they looked at the car they told us we did something to make this happen   but we didn t   they had the car for almost a month and a factory rep came down to look at it and there was a factory defect in the engine which caused the engine to blow   i wanted my money back and they said no   a new     car and a blown engine   that could effect the transmission etc   they did give me    back for the extended warentee but they let us keep the warentee   that was a deal   we had the car for   months and a humming in the middle to rear of the car started   it got worse   there was also a vibration with it too   we took it in many times anf finally i found out there was a defect in the torque converters and was keeping it hush hush because they didn t have enough torque converters to replace it on all the cars   i didn t want the car   luckily we live in florida with the lemon law and we got back every penny we paid for the car   i was thankful for that   i felt made it good so i used all that money and ordered a new   convertible laserred   cylinder   we felt it was a fluke that we had problems with the first the second we did eventually have problems with the torque converter but the dealer said there was nothing wrong with it   that s another story   see my write up about it and my   gt     
82,0,  my roomate recently bought a   explorer sport   the suv is really nice but it is too bumpy and can flip very easily   the front seats aren t very comfortable and the back seat is awful   i feel like i m sitting on a big pile of wood   if you are going to have   people in the back make sure one of them is a kid so they can sit in between the seatbelts in the middle of the seat   at least the child is small enough to where they don t sit on them   they hurt pretty bad when you sit on them   the back hatch or rd door is nice but really heavy   if you are a woman you will probably have to use two hands to pull it down to close it   now for the side doors   after a few months of opening and closing the doors they get to where you have to slam them shut   it starts to get very hard and annoying to close the doors   if you own and know about the   quot free quot   oil changes that you can purchase for   or   years   have all your paperwork with you the first and second time you go to the dealership to have it done   if you don t and doesn t have you in the system or says that they have never heard of that before   you will end up paying for it and fighting with to get your money back for that oil change   after   or   times it gets better   they usually have you in the system by then   the body of the suv is really nice but not nice enough for me to own one i ll have to stick with the chevy tahoe in this category br br  
83,0,    disclaimer i   attempts at a detailed analysis   based on the intensifiction of the fight between the two giants   call this bitter battle between these two giant companies whatever you want   call it the battle of the sturdy ceos   lampe and nasser   john and jacques   the battle of the cream of the creams   you may even want to call the breakup of relationship a divorce of co from bridgestone firestone   all of this has come after numerous fatal accidents and recalls of tires by both companies   the victims have filed lawsuits in the meantime   in what ways will this public battle benefit regular   poor and suffering consumers   their loved ones are long gone   no camp appears to take the blame for the lack of safety and the shredding and peeling of tires in last year s series of accidents   one of the protaganists seems to say something that includes the consumers whose heart   money and business both camps are looking for   there may be some grain of truth to this statement by bridgestone firestone president john lampe    business relationships   like personal ones   are built upon trust and mutual respect we have come to the conclusion that we can no longer supply tires to since the basic foundation of our relationship has been seriously eroded b which side to believe   how about consumers   safety in all of this b i co ceo fires back     we are deeply disappointed that firestone decided not work together for the safety of our shared customers   which is the only issue that matters   despite all the shots fired back and forth   consumers become spectators of this major disagreement   they are taking lessons   they want to know which side is truly interested in protecting them   giving them the assurance of safety on the roads   after all   they are the ones who buy the various explorers on which the firestone tires were mounted   jacques nasser decides to recall close to   million more firestone tires on its suvs   it has already made plans to replace the firestone wilderness at tires by signing a contract with goodyear   all of this news leaves john lampe with no other alternatives other than to ask for an inquiry of the explorer   this news is nothing but positive for the consumers and the plaintiffs of various lawsuits   if anything wrong is found in the explorer design   they will be able to use this new information against   on the other hand   ceo jacques nasser wants to continue believing that all the problems lie with the tire manufacturer    john lampe does not understand why his s tires fair well in other vehicles   but not on explorer   he admits that this is prone to rollovers   this may explain why he is asking for an inquiry   he has taken steps making sure the proceedings get under way i   at that point   mr   lampe met with transportation secretary norman mineta and submitted to him a pretty long report about explorer s steering problem that may have contributed to rollovers is blaming on defective tires    for sure   the battle has intensified   still   the questions that most consumers are asking are   how safe is the explorer   how safe are the tires b what has been known in this conflict   a   the federal government has files linking bridgestone firestone to   deaths and more than   injuries   based on these data   it appears that firestone had no other games to play other than to be forthcoming and cooperative to save its skin   we all know how last summer   bridgestone firestone agreed to recall    million tires that the government linked to the previous deaths b   has a lot of ammunition against firestone   and firestone has a lot against too   so much for the   year relationship that saw the marriage of blood and flesh over the years   plaintiffs of lawsuits filed against both companies are paying close attention to the tidbits of info that fall on their laps   who would not jump on them c    important features despite all the rumors    explorer has been a best seller   it is one of the s lines of vehicles that has had some great returns over the years   most consumers continue to buy them despite the existence of its competitors as found in gmc jimmy   blazer   jeep cherokee wd and jeep cherokee wd   the   explorer comes with air bag driver   air bad passenger   side impact door beams   theft deterrent system   window   driver side express door etc and all the standard features while this breakup may be a catalyst to many plaintiffs   lawyers   grin   what remains to establish to end all doubt is whether explorer is all that it s cranked out to be   it will be up to the inquiry team to answer this question   john lampe can t answer it himself   let s hope that the truth   the whole truth will come out without any problems   the public   the consumers are watching   they have already paid with the blood of their loved ones   they are suffering while they recover from last year s flurry of peeling tires accidents may the truth come out   this way   if any defect is found in the vehicle   it may be corrected to save lives on the roads   as far as the tires are concerned   let s hope that more whistle blowers come out like erin brokovich   it is said that alan hogan has been the erin brokovich in this case   may he continue to serve society and the regular joes with his moral values   we need more people like him around   don t you agree  
84,0,  my   explorer sport was my favorite vehicle that i ve owned   when it was running   the things that i liked about this suv is that it is very roomy and handles very well   these are about the only things that i liked   every month i had a problem with it   everywhere from that cooling system to the transmition   nothing but problems   not only was it always broken down but it also was terrible on the gas mileage   the two other cars that i have had for an extended period of time were a toyota pickup and the car i have now is an altima   i haven t had a problem with either of these vehicles   notice that they are both foriegn cars   i would not encourage anyone to purchase the   explorer sport unless given to you or you have too much money and you want to use it on repairs     
85,0,  i have a explorer sport and i know i am going to get some flack for writing this epinion but i feel i must voice my epinion anyway   i have read many other epinions about the explorer and many people seem to love this suv i however would never ever buy another one the vehicle is very attractive looking roomy quite comfortable and not that bad on gas but the construction is extremely poor   my doors   quot dropped quot   because the hinges were made so poorly   the inside door panel and handle construction is so poor that my handles actually broke off just from regular use which in turn caused my inside door panels to crack split and then break altogether when i take the vehicle out of   wheel drive i am instructed to back up a bit to totally disengage the hubs   what is that   i don t see other people backing up all over the place to do that   this can t be right but if i don t back up i hear crunching and grinding and i don t dare drive it what a poor system   i was told by the service department that this was normal for the explorer though and that i need to backup my abs system doesn t work properly either and i have had times when i wasn t sure i was going to be able to stop for school buses and such   i found this to be a very scary experience now i get a recall card in the mail saying the rear door   hatch   hinges are poorly constructed and could be dangerous   no kidding i have   years left to pay on the piece of junk and wish i had never bought it   if i could get out from underneath it i would in a heartbeat i would not recommend the purchase of and explorer to anyone and would never consider buying one again i have dubbed mine the exploder i consider it one of the worst vehicles i have ever owned br br  
86,0,  in march    i decided to buy a explorer sport after thoroughly researching information on suv s in my price range   for the first month i truly enjoyed my new car   i like the power it has but not the gas it uses but i knew it wouldn t get good gas mileage and i was okay with that   but what i hate about this vehicle is how many recalls it has had already   among the other problems i ve had with it   one month after i bought the vehicle the back window shattered out while it was sitting in the carport   when the dealer fixed it they in turn screwed up the back wiper so i had to take it back in   i m glad i wasn t driving at the time   then i got the recall for the secondary hood latch   then a recall for the cruise control   then a recall for the windshield wiper blades   because they would swish back and forth when you used the turn signal and sometimes even when you didn t use the turn signal   last week i had to take the vehicle in because it s running rough   it sputters then very quickly accelerates when taking off from a stop or backing up and the transmission feels like it s slipping   when i picked up the vehicle i had to go to the service person and ask them to explain the receipt   he told me that the problem could not be fixed as it is under investigation by   they don t know what s causing the problem and until they do they don t know how to repair it   once they figure it out they will be sending out   another   recall   that means i have to drive this vehicle with it running the way it is until then   it s embarrassing to be in this v sohc vehicle and have it sputter so bad you can hardly back out of a parking space   then have it catch and fly out of that space i don t think anyone should buy this vehicle     
87,0,  pros   looks nice when it s clean   reliable so far   sits up high like most suvs   it s not too big nor too small   priced fairly cons   poor gas mileage    mpg around town     mpg highway   the biggest single negative feature is the child restraints or lack of adequate restraints in the rear seats   child seats tip going around corners   i have advised of this problem and they have not seen fit to warn potential buyers i purchased this vehicle because it looked nice and i ve never owned an suv   i haven t seen many explorer sports on the road so far   probably because of the firestone tire recall that was all over the news some weeks ago   i m told that firestone tires on this vehicle are not affected by the recall because they are   inch tires exterior    i purchased a black suv and it looks beautiful when clean and shiny   unfortunately most black vehicles need a considerable amount of care   the design is just right for my taste   it s not too large   like some suvs   but it does take some getting use to judging distances when parking   the middle windows have a slight tint and the rear windows have a darker tint   the rear window is dark enough so i don t have to change my inside rear view mirror at night interior    i give the interior a   primarily because of the potentially dangerous child car seat restraints are none existent   my two and three year old grandchildren were tipping back and forth going slow around turns   the rear seating is for two people   only   seatbelts exist only for two people and no more   if i d noticed this when i was considering the purchase   i would not have bought the vehicle the interior color is grey with a synthetic leather which appears to wear on the drivers side very fast for only six months of use   engine    the v appears to have adequate power   as mentioned earlier   my only difficulty comes with the poor fuel economy   sorry   but there s no good excuse for poor gas mileage this day and age ride    the explorer sport is a truck of sorts and rides like one   obvioulsy not as smooth as a passenger car but i would have no problem taking this vehicle off road before i d take other passenger car   you will feel most small pot holes and cracks in the road handling    highway driving concerns me the most   i m very careful not to make any sudden steering control turns because i feel this vehicle will turn over like many suvs have to date   this is probably do to the higher than normal center of gravity   the   wheel drive worked well during a recent snow storm   the brakes are beginning to grab and make noises already reliability    so far this suv has been reliable   probably because i paid a considerably fee for extra protection at the dealership   like anything else   i ll get very concerned when the extended warranty expires   car are very expensive to repair value    considering the price   it s a fair value   not great   just fair extra features    i purchased a model with a   cd pioneer changer in the dash   the cd works great the verdict   i would not consider another explorer sport for my next purchase   there has to be much better products out there for a better price average score     out of   comfort   ok except on bumpy roads quality   little noise   but not too bad roominess   adequate handling   amp   control   good condition   new model year    model and options   satisfactory recommend to friends or family   no    
88,0,  in august of   i   russell   turned the age of    my parents told me i could have any car that was available to my choices on the lot   no special oredering my dad said   so as a   year old getting his first car   a new one at that   i was very estatic to look at my options   i knew that i either wanted a or an explorer   well my decision was made   the explorer was mine   after about   months of having my suv   my check engine light decided to come on   as soon as that happend no more than   hours later i took it to the dealership and it took them   weeks to fix it   it needed a tune up already   well in mid march my mach   radio system   factory   blew   the dealership did not want to fix this saying that it was my fault   and needless to say my sunroof stopped working   my leather seats started to tear   and keep in mind   i kept very good care of this car   very good   she was my baby   i do not think i liked anything about this car after having it for a year and a half   driving this car was an unbelievalbe experience   everybody where i live wanted to drive it   it was easy on the handling   very aggresive   and super fast   if you think that this was just a lemon then buy one   on my opinion i have   other friends that just have gotten new ones in the past year and they have done the same   i would not recomend this vehicle to my worst enemy   now however has come out with the explorer sport trac   this car is better by far   i have had mine for about   months now and she has gave me no problems at all   i recommend the explorer sport trac   not the explorer sport br br  
89,0,  my experience thus far with and my explorer sport has been subpar   reviewing an automobile   i d like to take the more consumer reports approach   and just list the good things and the bad things i ve experienced since january    good     my dealer was fast   and gave us what we wanted quickly     we got a surprise delivery of two very nice   folding director s chairs with the   quot outfitters quot   logo that we use regularly   it was a nice touch   especially with them not even telling us about the gift     it s a comfortable car with effective air conditioning and practical seating   the fold down rear seats are a very smart design   ok   the bad     it was a bit overpriced for what i got   i ve driven a jeep cherokee before this   with the old body style   and it was much cheaper and practical     the gas mileage is totally horrendous   i have yet to obtain the average mileage advertised on the window summary at the dealer   very bad times to be driving gas guzzlers   again   something the cherokee was much more efficient in     credit has been very crooked   we specifically asked not to receive their special warranty   but the creditors charged us anyway   and when we asked for a refund   they simply applied the   dollars toward the end of our loan   and they have not cooperated or tried to undo the situation since   so   we are in effect paying interest on an   dollar warranty we asked not to have   that was a major downer     the stereo sucks     the suspension sucks     it s value has already depreciated significantly from the time of purchase   and we are already after   months well into negative equity it s my first   and probably my last for a long time     
90,0,  i bought my first new car in    after many test drives of other suv s i chose a brand new explorer sport   i had it custom made and bought an extended warranty    miles or   years   after a year i started to have problems   i can t remember all the problems   mostly brakes   every time i brought it in i had to pay a    dollar deductible   even though i had a warranty   it was always something i brought my vehicle to a reputable garage in town every    miles to have the oil changed and i went by the book with all the maintenance that was needed    gave me a book with maintenance checklists   i never failed to miss a    mile maintenance   i even had the tires rotated when i brought the vehicle in for a oil change   i had the book checked and signed by the mechanic before i left   i never beat on the vehicle or drove it recklessly   i was at    in august    i was in town and the vehicle died   it was the transmission   i had to have it towed to a local transmission garage   they told me it would cost at least     to just get it going   not including anything else to do it right   i called and they wouldn t even listen to me   they didn t care that i had proof that i properly maintained my vehicle because a mechanic didn t do the maintenance   they said my warranty expired    miles ago   nothing we can do   i had just paid off the vehicle   months before and i was stuck with a piece of junk   i also have to say my tires lasted longer than the transmission    i just replaced the tires for the first time a few weeks before   no one at cared or would listen to me   i told the transmission mechanic to fix it quick to get it going   it cost me     to get rid of it   i traded it in for a honda civic and haven t had one problem with it in two years and my warranty has no deductible   i am currently looking for another suv   my employer is currently advertising any vehicle for purchase over    dealer invoice   even with this incentive i will never purchase another again   i can only recommend this vehicle if you have the money for all of the repairs or you buy an extended warranty without a deductible and trade it in before your warranty expires br br  
91,0,  most car manufacturers have a line of cars that are highly profitable because they have not had to change them in years   a few cosmetic upgrades here and there   and the vehicle is launched as a new model year the explorer has been around for over a decade and the   explorer sport is the most modern interpretation of this old platform   new grill   body cladding and white gauges can t hide a rigid rear suspension   poor gas mileage and some old demons such as poor build quality b engine   the dealer told me that the    v in the explorer was the german built powerplant designed to lower emission levels   very smooth but very thirsty b transmission   mated to this german powerplant was this new french transmission   after   months   this transmission failed and had to be replaced   this left the car at the dealership for almost two weeks   the flip side of this was that i had a nice little focus to drive b interior   wonderful seats and a nice update to the standard explorer interior including white gauges and faux brushed metal door handles   every piece seemed to be made from quality materials   however   in the   door sport model   the front passenger seat was difficult to slide back to allow access to the rear seats   very strange given the wonderful   door mechanism there was in a probe i used to have    the front passenger seat would slide out of the way   this would have been a nice feature in the explorer sport nice touches include the puddle lamps off the mirrors b problem areas   rear fixed window leaked and had to be rebeaded and replaced   rear windshield wiper failed   matte finish of the front door arm rests wore off in just   months   ancient rear suspension meant very bad handling in parking lots over bumps   as mentioned above   the transmission failed right in the middle of traffic and it took almost   weeks to have it replaced   the transmission problem lead to major arguments with the dealer   customer relations and the service manager b dealer support   um   non existent   the problem areas had to be escalated to customer relations to resolve   because the explorer sport ended up being serviced for over   days   i qualified for the california lemon law and i eventually moved to a escape   the dealer experience was so bad that this will be my last since i ve been driving fords in   
92,0,  you may think that a new design will improve the previous design not necessary with   explorer   the only change is the head and tail light i went to the dealer with a very positive attitude to test drive the new explorer   was i impressed when i left   not at all   the same opinion as last model the ride is very bumpy   it feels like sitting on wood   the engine sounds like a tractor trailer and cornering is a disaster   i felt very unsafe driving without the seat belt because i was sliding all over the place front seats are so so   but rear seats are very uncomfortable   you ll think that after all the complaints that people made about seat comfort that will make some improvement   but unfortunatlly they did not and   model is the same as previous except for little minor changes explorer does not have the car like ride as nissan pathfinder   toyota runner or grand cherokee   it has very rough bumpy ride does it really worth      please think again br br  
93,0,  i always wanted a truck   especially after owning a little ol   station wagon for many years   i wanted to go big   but could only afford small   and ended up with a   x xlt   at the time of purchase   and for the next few years   it was the greatest truck in the world   got me where i needed to go   and took everything else with it   the extended cab was perfect to toss bags or anything else in   and also housed a little bazooka tube for some extra thump when i wanted to turn the music up the v engine gave me a nice ride   though it was a bit underpowered   compared to what i drive now   and it turned out to be this engine that would cause me all the pain and suffering in the world a truck can cause you   it started innocently enough when my car suddenly overheated and stopped in the middle of the freeway one day   pushing my car into the temsco   i was told it was simply a leak in the radiator fluid line   which it was   and i was told they d fixed it   which they hadn t   so the next day   i drive from southern oregon to seattle   a good   mile trip   truck drives fine   though the whole way   i m scared out of my gord it s gon na die again   and alas    miles from my final destination   it does   this times its a wee bit worse than before   one of the heads has cracked   and will need to be replaced   this is done   and after a few hundred bucks down the drain   i come to find out not only one head is cracked   but both heads were cracked   and the other would need to be replaced   more money   both heads fixed   phew   except now my engine is loud with a constant ticking noise that just won t stop   and for the next few years   it kept it up   never could get fixed   until the truck was traded in for a toyota camry   it was really one bad problem that made driving the truck a chore and kept me from being happy to own it   and with the other problems i ve seen drivers have   i don t think you ll see me behind a wheel ever again br br  
94,0,  wednesday night   who goes out on a wednesday night   there s this reggae party that happens at one of the beach front hotels in my area   kind of a tradition for the locals   but i haven t been to it since    well   a bunch of my fianc s co workers talked him into going with them and of course   he wanted me to come   because i usually don t get off work until pm ish   i knew we d have to leave as soon as i got home   wow   almost   years and it hasn t changed much   because it s a beach party that involves cheap alcohol   it can be pretty amusing   but something about sitting outside when it s like   degrees and the food selection is limited to picked though chicken wings   ripe cheese squares and crackers doesn t really make me want to drink   but some of the people are interesting to look at   like that little hippie looking guy with a camel toe and a belt buckle bigger than his head   or how about that screaming lady who forgot a bra that the bouncers are escorting out   hmm   have another beer   i m glad i didn t drink   because my fianc   friends did   what s scary is one of them owns a   expedition and felt he could drive it home   in short   i got to drive a   expedition   the expedition   introduced as a   model   is the nd flagship to s high profit suv line that lead to introduce the excursion   which is still struggling   so much so that had to cut manufacturing in half about a year and a half ago   like gm   has a large selection in suvs and suv like trucks   but in a market flooded with costly suvs constantly being shoved down consumers throats   consumers are now starting to choke on the high gas prices and cost of ownership   the success of the   expedition is very important for and their recovery after last years    billion dollar profit loss   proving that not all consumers need    lb   gas guzzlers   that is   unless you re a soccer mom   it looks like suvs have taken over the reputation the minivan once had   one of the main selling points for the redesigned expedition is it handles much better off road and is not as   soft   and gm s tahoe yukon line   i wanted to find out who the expedition is really targeted to and how much it really improved over its predecessor b i exterior    at first glance   i mistook it for the   explorer   the expedition looks very identical to it with the same front grill   headlights   bumper trims and overall body shape   maybe this helped save money on the redesign   i m wondering why they look so identical when the previous models of the explorer and expedition looked nothing alike   i think some consumers are still weary about the explorer after the whole firestone mess   so maybe this wasn t a smart design move   the expedition is    inches or    feet long     inches or    feet wide     or    feet tall   it has a ground clearance of    inches and weighs in somewhere around    lbs   depending on the engine and if it s wd or wd   color options for the eddie bauer edition include white   dark green   black   light green   red and dark blue   there is no silver option yet and i prefer silver   but that s just me   but   you d think it would be an option because it s a basic color   color options for the xlt model include a plain beige   tan   dark green   black   dark gray   light green   red   blue   while   silver and light blue   all are plain   everyday colors   but i suppose it would look a little funny in bright yellow   aqua or even the iridescent blue honda offers   but i would still like to see some metallic orange tones and maybe a dark plum purple b con b   overall   the looks are bland   lacking the ability to turn heads   but clean   the expedition does sport a lot of black plastic on the exterior   like many new suv trucks   depending on what trim options you get   i m not really fond of that because it s a maintenance pain   requiring regular polishing so it does not turn white in the sun   i used to gripe about polishing the front and back bumpers on my old tercel   it took a lot of elbow grease get the plastic to absorb the polish and it was time consuming   the expedition has a lot more plastic than my old tercel   i recommend getting it professionally detailed every   months to keep up the plastic   but that can cost around    for a vehicle that size each time     interior    it s hard to say what people like in interiors   everyone seems to want something different   some look for leather   polished wood and a dial clock   i ve never figured that out   while others may want a unique layout with cool upholstery design   colored gauges and lots of light up goodies   but i think most want the interior to feel like a home away from home   whether it s conservative or bold   but it s not quite as easy to customize your car interior as it is your home   i think tried to please everyone with the expeditions interior   but did it with as little statement as possible and no real   boldness   and seemingly sucking the   sport   out of sport utility vehicle   i say this because it s a little on the bland side   according to s site and the one i drove   there is only one color option for the interior   so far   it s tan   or light beige   with a tan and black plastic like dashboard   because the dash is so big   there is a lot of negative space on it with no controls or vents   making it seem like an ocean of plastic   i would prefer more storage cubbies instead of wasted space   there s a large gap between the climate control panel and the stereo of just black plastic   the steering wheel is beige   but the background is black creating a strange mismatched feeling   the power controls are located on the door armrest area and were easy to reach   but did not get in the way   the captains chair for the drivers seat is nice   offering an armrest on either side   the leather is comfortable   but gets very hot in the sun   may want to consider a seat cover for the summer   the gauges are standard black background with back light   again   this is bland   old styling   it would be nice if they used a white background instead   like the escape or even get a little crazy with the new metallic tones   such as the matrix vibe duo   the climate control vents are large and round and the ac seems to cool down the cabin fairly quick considering the size   both the nd and rd row of seats fold down   creating   cubic feet of storage     con b   but   the seats only fold down   they can t come out   so they re still there taking up space   most minivans have an advantage in that aspect because both rows of seats can be removed creating more storage space   the storage space isn t bad   but not good compared to many minivans   the toyota sienna has    cubic feet   the honda odyssey has    cubic feet and finally the kia sedona has    cubic feet of storage with the seats removed   all more than the large expedition   the expedition only has    cubic feet of storage behind the rd row of seats   while the sienna has    cubic feet   the odyssey has    cubic feet and the sedona has    cubic feet   again susprisingly more than the expedition for head room   the expedition has    inches of headroom for the front row     inches for the nd row and    for the rd   while the honda odyssey has more with    inches for the first row     for the nd and    for the rd   in fact   even the new small to mid sized honda pilot suv has more head room than the expedition at    inches for the st row     inches for the nd row and    inches for the rd   if you re interested in the expedition for space and cargo capacity   looks like a minivan would be the better choice an optional feature is the rd row of seats can powered down by using switch in the back reached when the back is opened up   i m not sure that s really helpful and i wonder how that can go wrong in the future   i would rather the seats be removable to open more space   than powered down b i engines    there are two v engine options for the   expedition   the first is the standard sohc   valve     liter v with   hp and   lbs   of torque at    rpm   though it sounds powerful   sadly   it does not seem to carry the expedition s weight well   the chevy avalanche comes with a   hp engine that gets about the same gas mileage as this engine and it didn t seem much better   depending on wd   the gas mileage on this model varies from    to     however   you may not get this mileage right away   i have read from other owners that there seems to be a break in time of lower gas mileage for the first few months the nd engine is the optional sohc   valve     liter v with   hp and   lbs   of torque at    rpm   this is an improvement   but the gas mileage is between    to    depending on wd   this engine can tow up to    lbs   the gas tank capacity is   gallons   giving you   miles to   miles to a tank   depending on engine type and city of highway driving and can cost between    to    or more to fill up the tank   depending on gas prices in your area b con b   the gas mileage is a major gripe about the expedition   no improvements here   i realize something of this size needs power   but it s insulting when a v minivan that gets about   mpg can hold as much or more than the   expedition   about   years ago   was making noises about a hybrid   hp v engine that gets around   mpg and possibly a v version with the new hybrid technology   when it was first mentioned in    i think   the targeted release date was in    but that seems to have faded   possibly due to profit loss   but if can produce a mainstream suv with a hybrid engine   i think it would give them the market edge they need to recover the lost profit and change the standards for suvs   but   i guess that technology is beyond at this point and we ll have to leave it to the japanese to introduce the first us hybrid suv   can comply with car standards and have the new expedition can achieve mileage of    or higher   but choose to keep the expedition in the old   utility   class   where the gas mileage requirements are lower   they save money on manufacturing and the consumer pays more for gas   most consumers buying this model will not be using it for utility   but more as a minivan commuter car   in that aspect   someone needs to tell we re moving forward not backwards in technology b i handling    handling is one of the major improvements in the next generation expedition and i will say it s quite an improvement   road noise and wind shear seem to be non existent   it s a quiet ride   unless you have the stereo cranked   but it was almost too quiet   i found myself getting sleepy   maybe boredom played a role in this as well the power steering was very easy and somewhat responsive and the brakes seem to work well   but don t take that for granted   something of this size and weight has a lot longer stopping distance than a car   i don t recommend tailgating anybody in this because you may not have enough time to stop if they slam on the brakes   the overall handling was a little mushy because it felt like the body was reluctant to turn with the wheel   making tight turns a challenge   it has independent front and rear suspension   while i did not get to take it off roading   i would imagine it would do well b i standard features    b pros b   standard features include keyless entry pad and remote keyless entry    wheel disc brakes with abs   child safety seat anchors   dual front airbags   leather seats   eddie bauer   power steering   low profile roof rack     wheels     bench seats in the first row   xlt only   captains chairs standard on eddie bauer   rd row bench seats   tilt steering column   cruise control   cd cassette stereo   power windows   power locks and dome light b i optional features    an optional feature that proves the expeditions minivan likeness is dvd rear seat entertainment center   it offers    screen that folds down from the ceiling and a control panel with headphone jacks   a interesting feature   but i m sure parents will agree that if this kind of entertainment is needed   a gameboy or two is much cheaper and portable other optional features include safe canopy system   tire pressure sensing   power fold down rd seat   climate controlled front seats   eddie bauer only   wd   nd row captains chairs   power fold rd row seats   front hooks with wd only and moonroof b i safety    one safety concern about suvs   minivans and any vehicle with open storage area in the cabin is in the event of a bad accident   any large items in the cabin   such as a cooler   groceries   supplies for a beach trip or a sheet of wood   can hit passengers and cause injuries or worse   so if your in the habit of driving with a lot of stuff in the car all the time   you may want to rethink that or look into putting some kind of wall or separating barrier between it and the cabin that s strong and will not come loose easily   one thing mentioned in the ads is a safe canopy system with roll over sensor   what the heck is that   well   it s an optional safety feature that s basically a wall of side airbags lining the st and nd row of seats   the roll over sensor allows the airbags to stay inflated it the vehicle is rolling and will deflate when it stops rolling   i can t decide if this is comforting or scary with all the roll over controversy around suvs   but i did chuckle a little at the irony   if i were a better comedian   i could base a whole routine of this alone     con b   this system does not cover the rd row of seats   kind of cheesy   if you re going to advertise such a complex safety system for a so called large family vehicle   make sure it protects all passengers   the   model did very well in the government crash test ratings   however   the close relative   the f   did horribly in the iihs tests   because this is so new   it s too soon to get crash test ratings on it   i would assume would only improve from the   model     warranty    the   expedition has a   year     mile bumper to bumper warranty    year     warranty on the safety restraint system and a   year    mile power train warranty b i resale    like a minivan   i think most people buy a vehicle like this hoping they won t have to drive it for a long time   maybe just until the kids grow up or until the boat phase is over   mainly because it s expensive   uses a lot of gas   is a pain to wash and not the most exciting thing to drive   so it s important that a vehicle of this price range holds a high resale value   being a new   redesigned model   that can be a gamble   especially with possible gas problems in the future   i recommend taking a look at reviews of older expeditions from owners and look at what used expeditions are selling for   you can check listings nationally at cars     parting shots    despite the changes and improvements   the   expedition does not stand out from the competition   but comes across as another   run of the mill suv   the looks are nothing to get excited about   power is mediocre   while gas mileage is poor and space seating capacity are average   while it does have a promise of improved safety and improvements in handling and suspension for off roading uses   the     to     price tag and yuppie soccer mom feel may not appeal to the class that will go off roading   overall   the   expedition is a nice vehicle   in terms of some what luxury with refined off road handling   but i did not find it   fun   to drive   when i say fun   i mean something that handles with a little spirit   is easy to drive and park   and a little different   unique in some aspects from other vehicles in it s class   like the looks of the toyota matrix pontiac vibe   or the above average power and gas efficiency of the nissan sentra spec v   or even the new hybrid technology and looks of the toyota prius   but i did not find any of these qualities in the   expedition   i like something i can look forward to driving every morning   but i think i would look forward to the expedition about as much as i would to a bowl of bran cereal with skim milk   there is nothing   special   about it and i can see where it can be classified with the   tan minivan   in terms of excitement   even though it has more luxury qualities   it by no means has the reputation or demands the attention that one would get driving a luxury sedan   such as a lexus or an acura that i think luxury buyers are looking for   nor is it as fun to drive because it s more sluggish and the handling is mushy   i don t think luxury buyers want to be mistaken for a dreaded soccer mom   even if they are taking their kids to soccer practice   it gets a   star rating as stated in my avalanche review   my major complaint goes something like this   the newest expedition is another contribution to the suv truck power craze that has brought dreams of big bucks to the big detroit three and i must say i m not impressed   as an answer to the now outdated suv craze   we are starting to see a lot of these over powered utility vehicles that are being shoved down consumers throats with high price tags through extreme advertising   the problem   by using loopholes in the emissions standards   american and other auto manufacturers make more profit by selling vehicles   such as suvs and suv like trucks   classified as   utility   vehicles   designed for utility   not for commuting or everyday uses   problem is they re being advertised and sold as everyday use cars   the reason   selling a utility vehicle is cheaper for a manufacturer is because there is    mileage and emission standards required   however   consumers are the ones reamed with the extra fuel costs   but the manufacturers are saving money and that s what s important   right   these loopholes have allowed american manufacturers to become dependant on the profit from selling more utility vehicles than cars   a good example of this is s latest advertising campaign with bill talking   i ve only seen two versions of these commercials   for trucks and for suvs   just their   utility   vehicles   not for efficient family sedans or compact cars   because does not make a lot of profit on those   i wouldn t have a problem with large trucks and large suvs if they had more efficient engines and better safety ratings   it just seems that the consumers and the environment are the losers in this greedy game of profit   pardon my instantaneous rage   i just read a disturbing article on how america s gas consumption and emissions pollution has nearly tripled since   because of the suv boom and what the government is not doing about it   i like american vehicles as much as the next american   but it seems that the detroit three are shooting themselves in the foot by manufacturing all these trucks and suvs we don t need with old standards when gas prices are going up   the environment is becoming more of a concern and there is a big oil controversy on whether or not to drill in alaska   if the standards were tighter and they did not use the loopholes to manufacturer   america would never need to drill in alaska and gas prices would probably be cheaper now   agree   don t agree   the comment section is open        i came across this article that s rather disturbing today thecarconnection index asp article   other vehicles to consider honda odyssey    has more styling looks   more versatile space   better gas mileage   great crash test ratings   will seat    is cheaper and can even tow up to    lbs focus wagon    has lots of cargo space   head room   good looks   good gas mileage   american brand   is cheaper and comfortably seats   honda pilot    cheaper   smaller   better gas mileage   seats    tows up to    lbs   and has more head room thanks for reading  
95,0,  after owning a   expedition xlt for   years and being very pleased with it in every aspect   i expected the same from the   expedition   exterior looks great   except for being a follower of the new explorer   but i have nothing against that   i particularly loved the new interior design   the third row seating is a vast improvement in the new expedition   i did not have the power fold option for the third row   which is not a problem when letting the seat down   but getting it back up is a little tricky   i was pleased with the performance of the   vl and the independent rear suspension   the handling of the truck was much better than the old model   the wider mirrors were great just watch what you re doing when pulling into the garage but on to other things   my truck had a constant rattle coming from both the driver and passenger side doors   this absolutely drove me crazy   i took the truck to the shop   times for repair   with no success   the dealer called in a senior engineer from   but he never determined exactly what the cause was   so at that point   i was extremely disappointed with the workmanship of the truck   i hated getting into it each morning knowing i had to listen to the rattle for the   minute drive to work   we tried to get to buy the truck back   but we got the run around   they told us that it was a problem with the new design and they were going to develop a solution   but as of right then they didn t have one   to me   it seems they were telling us just to   deal with it   we have a really bad feeling about and the new expedition   i really liked the truck and thought i would never go back to a car or smaller suv   but i did   i now own a jeep grand cherokee   i didn t think i could love a vehicle as much as i love my cherokee  
96,0,  my daughter recently took over control of the family   explorer   plus i just dumped our van   with this   i decided that maybe my   seat explorer wasn t quite as big as i once thought   so   i am shopping for a full size suv   i hate mini vans   besides   i need   cars like a hole in the head first impression god this thing is huge   it looks a lot bigger than a tahoe   but in reality   its about the same size   i liked the choice of exterior color   although a rust color would look great   i did not like the major use of plastic   it gave it a cheap look drive train the wd unit i drove had the    v    plenty of power   the gas gauge was at a quarter of a tank when i started the test drive and was dead on e when i returned   i only drove   miles i did not like its handling very much either   it leaned a lot and seemed bothered by large cross winds   plus this one had an annoying rattle in the roof   also   it rode like a buck board   my bum was very stiff   interior i liked the seats and i like how the dashboard was laid out   but that is about all i liked   it was just plastic and some faux leather stuff   plus i thought the dvd system took up to much room   i did not stay in more than thirty minuets   and that is about all i could stand   durability if the rattle was any indication   it probably won t last very long  
97,0,  ok   let me start by saying   i really enjoy driving this car   it s low   fairly spunky   handles very well   and looks great   the front seats are comfortable   although a bit difficult to climb in and out of   the back seat is very small and not comfortable to ride in   but i generally don t need room for more than   so this isn t a problem for me   the trunk or hatch is pretty roomy   and can be expanded by lowering the back seats well   now for the downside   i bought this car in july of   for just under book value   i checked the title history and it had never been wrecked   since the time of purchase i have spent several thousand on repairs   my first problem was the alternator   after   days in the shop and a    bill   i had it back and working fine   next came the ignition system   requiring the distributor to be replaced for over     the next inspection required back brake calipers for around     my most recent problem is a bad headlight which sells for     anyway   these are just the major repairs   add this onto a new set of tires   a timing belt   oil changes   and other general maintenance   insurance   and well   you do the math   all of this happened in under   months of driving i have really enjoyed driving this car when it was working properly   it just hasn t done well at all for me   since purchasing this thing   i ve been in contact with several other     amp     probe gt owners with a similar story   taking all this into consideration   i obviously can not recommend this vehicle oh   by the way   mine is for sale if you re looking for one br br  
98,0,  i bought this vehicle used in    it had only    miles on it   a modest amount for los angeles   and looked to be in great shape   the previous owner certainly kept up the aesthetic quality of the car   so i test drove the car and after doing a little research decided to buy it well the problems started soon after that   the first major repair was when there was short in the electrical components of the car s overdrive   it would cause the car s rpms to ramp up in spurts   so i took it in and they had a hard time even finding the problem and then fixing it   several days in the shop and several hundred dollars later i got it back then i was driving home from work one day and a spark plug popped out of the engine block   i know it sound implausible but it happened   that required new wires   the exhaust pipe broke at a seam in the middle   that had to be soldered   it was leaking tranny fluid from the pan   all sorts of things that add up to a few hundred dollars and then the biggie   a complete valve job and replacement of the o sensor   it was leaking oil into the area of the spark plugs   i found out that this is a common problem of these    probes   that was    and six days in the shop and then there are the minor things   like the inner door panel on the driver side coming off   the power window switch falling off   the power attenae being power less   the window fluid sprayer is basically not working   there are a few noticeable rattles   so this car   at least for me has been nothing but a headache as well as a financial drain   when it is operating   it is fun car to drive   i love the look of it   and it certainly has some spunk with it s v   although i wish it accelerated a bit better   there is ample room in the trunk   but equally   quot un quot ample room in the rear seats for passengers   the driver side seat doesn t really go back as far as i would like   i would suspect for someone taller then me      quot   it would be a problem   but the seats themselves are quite comfortable   it corners on a manhole cover   i e   very wide   but it drives very comfortably   especially if you like a fairly stiff ride i bought the car because i liked how it drove and looked   my understanding is that the    and    models have a lot of problems    was the first year of their redesign   which may explain a lot of the problems   if you like the look and you like it when you test drive then if my experience is indicitive   then perhaps you need to look at a    or later br br  
99,0,  i bought my   probe gt used in   from a jeep dealer   stupid   i test drove the car and liked it because of the way it looked    it was sporty and fun to drive   it only had    miles on it   with a purchase price of      which i now know was about     too much   when we bought the car   there was a couple of cosmetic things that needed fixed   i e   passenger side door panel falling off   etc   these were fixed within a few weeks   about   months into our ownership   some other not so cosmetic problems started happening    brakes grinding loudly   muffler not muffling   normal wear and tear   but things that should have been checked before the dealership sold the car   we took the car in and   days later   these simple things were fixed in october of    approx    months after purchase   came the motherlode   the probe overheated one morning when i got to work   i shut the car off and fluids started draining from what seemed like everywhere under the hood   the dealer i bought the car from came to my location and picked up the car   after they looked at it   they assessed that the water pump had gone out   the oil pan gasket was leaking and it basically needed a valve job   thank god for extended warranty   i was without my car for approximately     weeks   total cost for that job was around     then when i got the car back   the   quot check engine quot   light was on   i called the dealership back and asked why the light was now coming on   when it was not before   they looked at the car again   and found   they thought   that the mass airflow sensor was bad     they replaced it   but it did not fix the problem   then they thought the o sensor was bad   another    some     replaced it   to no avail   finally they told me after another week   that they thought the egr valve had gone bad   but that it would not be covered under warranty    for the part alone   i explained to them that even though they considered this a   quot wear and tear quot   part   i should not have to pay for it   we went back and forth   i took the car back and drove it   engine light flashing in my face and all   until i contacted the better business bureau and a local television station   the dealership finally agreed to do the replacement i scheduled my appointment and took the car in   it took them about   days to get the part   when they replaced the egr valve   guess what     it did not fix the problem   surprise   surprise   so   they cleaned some vacuum lines   etc   still could not find the problem after about a week in the shop   they decided to send it to the dealer down the street and let them look at it   two and a half weeks later   i get my car back   but only after they put the car on their computer   it told them a part to replace   they replaced it and it didn t fix the problem   ultimately   i think   it turned out to be a problem with a vacuum pump   or something now    months later   yet another seemingly   quot impossible to figure out quot   problem has surfaced   on july      my car quit running   unexplainably   three different repair shops have looked over the car   trying to determine if it is an electrical problem   which i now understand these cars are notorious for having   or a fuel problem   no one can seem to figure it out   so now   i m back to the dealer on monday    i wonder if they can pinpoint the problem   i don t have a whole lot of faith i would not recommend this vehicle to anyone   unless you have money to just throw away   and a backup car to drive about every   months   for about a month at a time   and if you are just looking for a headache br br  
100,0,  i bought this vehicle from a friend in    he made me an offer i couldn t refuse   the car is beautiful   sporty and ahead of its time   overall   the probe is a great looking car   the body is very stylish today   even though it was made in    it s an eye catcher   there have been no major problems with rust   i love all of the options   ex   power sunroof   power seats   spoiler   alarm   ect   the probe gt has a lot of power with it s v engine   it also handles well in the snow and rain   the front seats are very comfortable and adjust to accommodate your liking   however   the back seats have virtually no legroom and are not designed for the comfort of backseat passengers   the ride is a little stiff and bumpy but generally speaking   it s enjoyable   unfortunately   i have had a lot of repairs made in the short time i have owned it   all mechanics i have been to say that it is a tough car to work on   not to mention   every little piece of the   gt is expensive to replace   in the   months i have owned the car i have had replaced or fixed   all   tires    throttle sensor   all spark plugs   tune up   muffler system front to back    i also had the transmission worked on several times   the mechanics couldn t find the problem until the third time i brought it in to them   finally   they had taken it to the local dealer and diagnosed it with a short in the transmission as well as being burnt up   the whole system was replaced   luckily   it was still under warranty from the person who owned it before me   he had paid     only a few months prior   one problem i have now is that the rpm s are very jumpy i think this may have something to do with the computer   as    gt s are known to have problems with this   i have no washer reservoir for the front windshield because it had cracked   i was told by that the reservoir alone would cost     i had the entire sound system replaced   the stock cd player broke only a few weeks after i bought the car and the speakers were already in need of replacement   the problem with this is that the eq only works with the stock cd player   i had called about replacing the old one with a new stock radio and the cost was     in turn   i replaced it with an after market stereo   which disabled my equalizer   but my new system is fantastic   i have a few squeaks and rattles that i probably should have checked out   but with the cost of everything on this car i m afraid to find out   once i regain some money   i will probably sell my   gt    i have a few suggestions for anyone thinking of buying a   probe gt   take into consideration the mileage   if it s high don t buy   find out how many people have owned the car   don t forget that it s a sports car it may have been be abused   understand that you most likely will have problems with this car and be prepared to dish out a lot of money   i would look into a different year and or model   another member of my family owns a first generation probe    and hasn t had too many problems   even with   k   they are fairly reasonable to fix too     
101,0,  i bought this car on december     since i have had nothing but problems   in may of    my transmission let go   this happened at   mph on the highway   transmission specialists rate the probe as a specialty car   therefore   the repair price was inflated     all the specialists i contacted claimed it was a very complicated job   i did find someone to do it for      the drawback was the probe ended up being in their shop for a month   next   the intake manifold gasket let go   again   i heard specialty car   again   i heard complicated to fix   i received a quote of       for the gasket   for the labor   i did find a decent mechanic who did the job for     i don t know if mechanics in others areas use the word specialty as an excuse to jack up the price   in my area it seems to be the norm   probes are known to have electrical problems   so far   mine have been minor just turn signals   just last week   i got a flat   of course this happens to any make or model car   the price for tires is higher than average   according to the tire dealer   the tires are specific   specialty i guess   to the car   i have very little faith in the car s dependability   i am just waiting to see what will go wrong next   i bought the probe because of her looks   she s a beauty   therefore   i am not surprised by the problems   i had hoped the co   had paid some attention to mechanical parts   i love the way she drives when in tiptop condition   she s smooth as a baby s butt and purrs like a kitten   upkeep   of course   will continue to remain a problem   it is fine for folks who have the budget to keep up with it   money is not the only factor   the inconvenience and the waiting associated with the probe going in and out of the shop is frustrating   it s a nice little car   but keep the excedrin handy   when i purchased this car it had    miles   i have heard the engines last till somewhere around     all one can do is hope if you re considering purchasing a probe please keep an eye out for its specialty problems    transmission and electrical   i really think it s best suited as a second car br br  
102,0,  i can not place this vehicle on my love it or hate it list because both are true   in    my husband and i decided to purchase a new car   he wanted something he could tow things with and keep his tools in   i wanted something with four doors so i would not have to fight with car seats   we searched around our area and came across the perfect medium   it had what we both wanted   we bought this   explorer   quot eddie bower quot edition suv   we were both happy with our purchase   we made our purchase in october of    by may of    we had to replace the transmission   i attributed this to my husband going four wheeling in a two wheel drive vehicle   this venture cost us    we shipped the truck to germany and for three years we prayed that we would not have transmission problems   we did   once   but my husband was able to fix that on his own   we did   however   have problems with the starter   we replaced it several times while in germany   this ran us     each time   we attributed that to the weather in germany all of this puts us in the year    we return from germany and embark on a road trip from pennsylvania to texas   our move involved towing a trailer   we were assured by the dealer and the transmission shop that the transmission would hold up for the trip they were wrong   we made it as far as odessa   texas   to be exact   we made it to mile marker   on i    that is where we were stranded because the transmission blew out   four days and    later   we have yet another transmission   it is under a   day guarantee   we are assured that we will no longer have problems with the transmission sixty five days later   my husband is on foot because the transmission has gone out again   we now have to tow the truck over   miles to get the transmission replaced under the warranty   another    we have to spend just getting the truck to the destination   not to mention the money of getting there to get the truck when it is fixed it seems everyone knew about the problems with a cs another review all together   starters   and transmissions   they just all seemed to forget until after we had all the problems   the above is why i hate the explorer this is why i love it it is paid for   i have the title for it   it is roomy   i love that it has the    seats   there is plenty of room for suitcases and tools all at the same time   the car seats all fit comfortably   i have had three bulky car seats in the back at one time being a short woman   i love the adjustment switches that allow me to be close enough and hight enough to see over the steering wheel   this is funny to my husband because he has to move the seat back before he can even get in the truck   when i am in my explorer   i feel as big as the other people on the road   i will be upset when we sell the explorer for the reasons listed above   you can bet that i will look for something larger so i do not feel like a   short   person on the road   i love my explorer   but i hate that i do not have deep enough pockets to keep it     
103,0,  i bought this car new in september    principally because my wife and daughter liked the forest green color   suv s were popular then   and my wife liked the idea of being higher than the rest of the traffic   the truck is somewhat bouncy   and if you are on a rough road   you really feel it   the good thing about the setup is the chair height   your knees are closer to a ninety degree angle when you ride   and that is a lot easier on your back than a sedan while the body style may be unstable in sharp turns   it sure holds a lot of haulage   i have used it to truck each one of my kids to college   i have found the truck to eat front brake pads   i average around k a set   i also think that there are problems with the design of the truck   the catalytic converter is in a place where it heats the transmission   and causes it to fail early   it is also near the front control arm bushing   and heats it so that it fails early   these are expensive repairs   the front suspension needed replacement as well at around k   the transmission failed in a catastrophic manner   and it cost around      to replace with a remanufactured unit   my dilemma is this   the truck still looks great   it has around k on it at this point   the engine is still tight   however   the ac delco remanufactured transmission is now starting the same death dance as the old one   right now   reverse is slow to engage when it is cold   this is how the other transmission started to fail   according to the transmission guy i deal with   this is a common problem with explorers   he has one   and his transmission does the same thing the truck is still expensive to keep up   it is always needing something like brakes   tie rod ends   exhaust parts and such   i have also detected weeping around the water pump   i don t know whether to sell it now   or keep it for the long haul   this truck is for someone who likes to make a good appearance   and has deep pockets for maintenance   it is not for someone who appreciates fuel economy or low maintenance cost   the   explorer is an early version   and there are a lot of bugs in it   some of the bugs were worked out in the   makeover   however   it looks like the biggest bug   the tendency to roll over   will not be worked out until the   model  
104,0,  i inherited bob t   named by my brother stands for big old brown truck   for my birthday   months ago   i paid a symbolic     and while i love it   i m ready to sell it i d always wanted an suv after a few years of driving my teeny tiny toyota tercel   so i was thrilled to get my brother s explorer   when i got it   it had just over k miles on it   at first i was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the seats were and with all the nifty little places to store stuff   like under the front arm rest   i was even more delighted to see that my gas mileage was much better than expected   i get about    mpg in the city and about   on the highway   the acceleration is pretty darn good   i oftentimes beat sporty little cars out of stoplights   once the initial delight wore off   that s when the problems started   now i understand that my bob t is   years old   but my brother took care of it well   so i didn t expect to be shelling out this kind of money   about   weeks after i got the truck   i had to replace the tranny   nice lil dent in my wallet   all seemed well for a week   but it started slipping again   i took it back to the dealership   and they fixed that problem to the tune of     about   weeks later   the brakes went out on me   back to the dealership and had the brakes replaced   my wallet is taking a serious beating by now   the brakes haven t worked properly since then   and no dealership or mechanic has been able to fix the issue just two weeks ago   i was driving down a busy street parkway and the brakes went out on me again   this time   i couldn t pump the brakes to get this behemoth vehicle to stop   i ended up losing control and hitting a guardrail   i didn t do any serious damage to myself or the truck   thank god   but to add insult to injury   as i was creeping back home from my little accident   the tranny slipped severely and i almost ran into the back of an ice cream truck   at that point   i just had the thing towed to the dealership and told them that it was now their problem   they   fixed   the braked and the tranny again this time to the tune of     my wallet can t take much more of this torture   the last time i drove the truck was   days ago when i brought it home from the dealership   i m a little scared to drive it i kind of look at it as a deathtrap now   so now it s a very nice driveway decoration   although i ve had some serious mechanical issues   i love this explorer because it can haul some major stuff   i was able to haul all of my stuff home from college in one trip   that s nothing to sneeze at considering i had everything but the kitchen sink in my dorm room   i love the feeling of being up higher than everyone else   and it s a great vehicle to take on camping trips with a whole bunch of friends my best advice   you want an suv   buy it new that way the warranty should take care of most any mechanical issue you can have   these are great vehicles   but older suv s like mine are best left for off roading and camping   not your everyday commute  
105,0,  i bought this because i needed wd and wanted something popular that i could easily resell   i bought it used at k and have put about k on it   in the   months of ownership   i have spent over     in repairs and have replaced the a c   the transmission   the wd gears and lots of minor stuff   the thing is my repair shop   to whom i am very loyal   explained they see the same repairs over and over on explorers   this is the   a c replacement and the nd transmission replacement i put a lot of highway miles on my cars and have had this truck in wd for less than   miles total   i change the oil and have it serviced like a good boy and they fellow from whom i bought it was a nutcase for servicing   this truck   as popular as it has been   is not engineered to last   i will not buy another one of these     
106,0,  my explorer was the first vehical i have ever bought on my own   the thing after i bought it was great   loved it to death   i owned the road in it and i loved working on it then one day the transmission went out   no big deal i thought   this happens after    miles   after that all was good for awhile till something else broke   when ever one thing would break   it would break something else   i spent over    fixing sensors that blew each other out   finally the last straw was when my engine blew   evidently a bearing went out and is causing the crankshaft to walk out of the engine   its off the road now waiting to be rebuilt then sold to some other unlucky person driving it was great   off road or on road i only got stuck once   i was dumb   and it hugged the road   in my buddies explorer   same year   we spun out on a dirt road goin   and was going sideways down the road   i figured we would have flipped over but it stayed stuck to the road   when we hit the clay embankment   injuries were non existant and the total damage was around     it took the beating with out a problem   i was in a fender bender in mine and all i had was a scratch on my bumper when the lady had to get a whole new grill and stuff   i think the problem was that my bumper hit her grill hood   too bad for the small car this is a great truck for someone who wants to rebuild it and modify it but not for someone with a small budget   me   the costs of keeping the engine and sorts working with this many miles on it was just too much br br  
107,0,  first   i would like to state that i did not choose to buy my    explorer   my parents bought this sports utility vehicle for me on my sixteenth birthday   with out any knowledge of this vehicle   they bought it blindly from an auction no less   one thing that you should never do   as i was looking up good and bad trucks to buy from consumer reports   it states that this years explorer was a bad choice to buy because it has many problems   i absolutely hate this vehicle for the fact that every time i would like to go somewhere   something goes wrong with it   every   miles   i have to fill the oil up one quart   and it is such a pain to deal with   then another thing that goes wrong with this car is that the windows   or electrical problems have started to arise   if you have ever rode a horse   it is the same feeling as riding in this truck   anyone who wants to buy this vehicle   would be a fool br br  
108,0,  it s    am and i am on my way to work in my economy toyota   cruising in the fast lane   i notice a excursion poking along in the slow lane ahead of me   as i get closer to passing it   i notice the wall of suv next to me getting closer to me   i slam on my breaks and the excursions back end barley misses taking off the front end of my toyota as it moves into the fast lane in front of me   did the driver even see me   were they even looking   maybe those big mirrors on the side weren t aimed low enough to pick up my car   if they d hit me   would they have noticed   now driving behind the mammoth   i can see the silhouette of the driver   the only person in it   through the back windows   ah   the driver is on a cell phone   i honked and flashed my lights   but i don t think they noticed   okay   this review is not just trashing the excursion   i m mainly writing it to bring up a few important points about large suvs to consider before purchasing   as you know   large suvs have been stirring up a lot of controversy lately that buyers should know about before purchasing   i recently purchased a new car   but considered an suv first and did a lot of research into them and promptly changed my mind first of all   there are lots off hidden costs on large suvs   like the excursion   of course   unless you have      to spend on one   you are going to have a high car payment   which is obvious   most consumers expect this   but did you budget the high fuel cost as well   a excursion weights about    pounds   because of this   it has a v or a v engine   which means it gets    miles per gallon or less   the v averages   miles per gallon   my toyota gets   times that mileage   meaning that an excursion driver is paying on average   to   times more for gas that a car driver   this will add somewhere between    to    a month to your car payment   still think you can afford this   then lets talk insurance   because the excursion is big and heavy   if the driver gets into an accident   like what almost happened to me above   it will cause a lot of property damage and injuries that your insurance will have to pay for   on top of that   there is a big risk that the drivers or drivers family of the smaller cars will sue you   which means you and or your insurance could be out a lot of money   they plan for this by charging a lot higher premium on suvs than normal size cars   you should get a quote from your insurance first now   on average   the excursion puts out over   times   or more with a v   the carbon dioxide of a normal sized car   this really angers people who care about the environment and causes them to do things to protest against this   one of the popular things is   suv tagging   where they ll put bumper stickers on your suv say mean things like your changing the climate and you don t care about the air   please check out the sites i have listed below for more information on this abcnews go sections us dailynews madtaggers html baaction org suvticket index html idontcareaboutair bumpers index shtml charm net marc chronicle suv may html poseur x org topten html this is a new trend and who knows where it will go   but do you want to constantly worry about your expensive suv being vandalized and then pay for the repairs   that s just more costs to worry about   like keeping your vehicle in your garage   not the excursion and most large suvs   they won t fit unless you have a custom garage   i bet that s expensive also   or just leave it out side all the time and worry about vandalism one more popular misconception about large suvs is that they are safer for families   for the most part   they are not   especially fords   the new vw beetle gets better crash test ratings that most suvs and trucks   do your research first

110,0,  i have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic   interior   power   warranty   options   etc   points of view   i believe an important   but always neglected area   though is from an undercar point of view   and let me tell you   most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear   there are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there   but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion   and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision   if a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles   i hope to help you decide based on my experience   which one will be better for you from the standpoint of strength of   and reliability of   one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole   the steering and suspension system   the contour   unfortunately   from an undercar standpoint falls into the category of a weak and suspect suspension   i just read a great review by mkaresh on the contour from almost every other viewpoint but the undercar   but he is an intellectual professional and i am a mechanical professional and i m quite sure he doesn t spend a lot of time on a dirty shop floor   in times past i could look at my schedule at work and accurately predict by what vehicles were on it where i would be able to take a break because i would be sure i would just be writing an estimate and not doing an alignment on that one   unfortunately the contour is starting to come into this category   to start off with one of the things about the contour that i don t like is that the ball joints and outer tie rods both are susceptible to premature wear out   neither are factory greasable   but to be fair   hardly any cars anymore allow for chassis lube   in as little as    miles i have seen contours needing both lower ball joints and outer tie rod ends replaced due to loosness   it is not an extremely expensive repair   but one would hope not to have to get that news at such a low mileage point   i am sure if you are the original owner things should be covered under warranty   but how many times has the dealer been very co operative with you and taken care of a warranty claim without any trouble    but if you are the second owner    another bothersome problem cropping up with the contour lately is the rear coil springs break   they seem very small in diameter compared to other cars in this class and are in fact weak   usually in replacing coil springs on most vehicles you need a spring compressor to remove and replace springs due to the extreme pressure   but i changed rear springs on a contour not too long ago and was able to push the spring down and start the nut on the strut shaft with just hand pressure   these were factory replacement springs   and hopefully an aftermarket spring will be stronger   the contour is only toe adjustable   not allowing for any caster adjustment nor front or rear camber adjustment   so if you give it a little curb shot and it gets knocked out of align   there just is no taking it to your tech and tweaking it back into align   it is out and will stay out   except for the toe angle   if you are considering a new contour read more reviews and weigh them out against this one to see if you can justify the purchase   if you are considering a used one   have it checked carefully by your mechanic for the things mentioned above   hopefully this will help you in making an informed decision   i for one would never own a contour   but i am basing this on just my experience from underneath   you make the call      
111,0,  so i had to drive a rental car for close to a month and i had two choices   the first was a minivan which i simply would not drive under any circumstance   the second choice was a contour   and i have to tell you   it was the worst car i ever sat behind the wheel in   first off the contour has all the visual appeal of grandma s car in my humble opinion   i suppose not a whole lot more can be expected from   yes if you haven t noticed i am a touch biased   but with that said   i can honestly say i have not liked the look of one single car since the early   s   and the contour is no exception   the interior is some what comfortable   but the look is very drab   there is no excitement to be found here   an awkward factory stereo consumes most of the center console and the rest is used up by oversized dials for the heater and air conditioning   one of my biggest problems with this car was the fact you couldn t turn the air conditioning on with the defroster on   now for those who don t live in cold weather   the air conditioner will take the moisture out of the air and defog your windows   very poor design   to top all the poor layout of the interior   everything was just cheap cheap plastic   nothing fit snuggly so the whole cab of the car had rattles   even at less then a year old and almost no miles this car was in poor condition   i hated driving it   now that i have pointed out some of the flaws of the interior of the car i will tell you how it drove   it drove like a suv   not only did it have a horribly stiff suspension when you hit bumps in the road   but the car leaned like a suv when you went around corners   you would feel like you were about to roll the car taking a corner any faster then    it s acceleration was less then stellar as well   even with a v in the car you felt like it would take forever to get up to speed   the throttle response was horribly slow as well   if you needed to get some speed to make a pass you better plan ahead about three seconds   not only did the car take forever to get to speed   it took just as long to stop   perhaps part of this problem is due to the incredibly cheap firestones the car comes with   i ended up having the abs kick in no less then three times doing pretty standard stops   when the abs didn t kick in   the car still took forever to stop due to its heavy weight   this car needs to go on a serious diet   now the gas economy of this car was just as bad as everything else   with my   mile commute every day i usually had to stop every other day and get twenty dollars in gas   when i picked the car up from the rental it had a quarter of a tank   before i even got home i had a gass light flashing at me   another improvement that needs to be addressed are the headlights   the high beams were average   but the low beams were nonexistant   if you drive at   mph at night with the low beams on   you are overdriving them   this car doesn t make a good commute car   it doesn t make a good fun car   its not built well enough to be a family car   i can t honestly think of anything good about this car   it would be a nice treat if stopped designing plain cars that are cheap to mass produce and design something that is better built   better to drive   more practical   and not so plain   agree or disagree with me if you like   but this car goes into my books as a total blunder br br  
112,0,  my mother owns a    contour special edition four door sedan   there have been six   six   manufacturer s recalls on various parts of the vehicle   she was only notified of this after the recalled item had effectively ruined another part of the automobile    ex   the wiper blades malfunctioned and gouged her winshield   she takes impeccable care of it   yet things are constantly falling apart   the shop fixes one thing   and another goes wrong   sure   all cars have their weak points   but it is ridiculous   definately not a car for someone who doesn t know how to do home repairs other than that it s a good little car   it has fast pick up   excellent braking   and the gas mileage is nothing short of miraculous for it s size   i m almost sorry to put it down   but consumers deserve the truth br br  
113,0,  i recently sold my     year old    contour svt   what am i buying instead   a   bmw ci   this commentary will explain my recent and difficult decision   first   let me praise s special vehicle team for creating an extremely fun to drive and practical sports sedan   performance in the svt is impressive based on a relatively small v    the engine is one of the top   most efficient engines in the world   measured by hp divided by liter   low end torque is not exceptional   similar to other competing cars in the same class   mid range torque is adequate   but high end torque is outright amazing   all of the fun and acceleration in this car is over    rpm s all the way to about    rpm s   it is not hard to chirp the tires shifting into second gear handling is also superb   nothing like a contour se   turn ins are sharp with almost no understeer   i always enjoyed highway entrance ramps in the svt   by the time i reach the merge lane i could easily be going    mph   one thing the svt is known for is its sweet exhaust note   at idle it is a low rumble   almost resembling a v    during acceleration   the exhaust really comes to life   if you are behind an svt you will hear it accelerate   as for the interior   it is basic and functional   the dash layout is not cluttered or overdone   i e   pontiac   unfortunately   it is very basic and almost seems to be missing something   this is a result of s   quot decontenting quot   on the interior since the inception of the contour in   as for the reason i sold the svt for a bmw   two reasons overall quality and refinement   my svt was in for small   pesky repairs on   occasions in the   months i owned it   it started with a squeaky clutch pedal   which is certainly annoying in rush hour traffic   next   the paint on the sill panel below the driver s side door was beginning to peel   this is unacceptable based on paint technology in today s cars   embarassing too   lastly   the airbag indicator light began to blink intermittently   upon further examination   the entire computer system was faulty and needed to be replaced   i sold the car with    miles on it before the warranty expired and these pesky repairs started coming out of my pocket as for the bmw   it may be more expensive than the svt contour   approx      with similar options   but it is a reliable   refined sport sedan   it has a better ride   is quicker   equal handling   and i no longer have to deal with dealerships overall   i would only recommend the svt if you can live with pesky problems and have a well established relationship with the service manager of your local dealership     
114,0,  my parents currently own a    contour   the   quot sport quot   version   my dad says that this car is his biggest mistake he had ever made   i always warned him about those vehicles   where   quot quality is our    job quot   hah   this car has been recalled four times   now that is   quot built tough quot   it has comfort seating for people that are three feet tall   when sitting in the back seat   you find out how flexible you are and how far you can put your legs behind your head   good ol   engineering put the oil filter right above the exhaust manifold   so where does all that oil drain onto   the exhaust manifold   and does it stink for at least three weeks after changing the oil   yes   would i take this car if someone paid me to   no   i think i would pay someone to take it away   my dad does that now cause it won t start   piece of br br  
115,0,  have you ever written an opinion   only to have it be eaten by the server at the last second   i have tried to write this several times now   and with each revision   i get a little less amused i would up renting the contour because my minivan was getting new brakes   the choices i had   about driving my van until the parts came in   no way   borrowing a car from a family member   haha   or doing without   led me to call the local u rent it i was actually pretty pleased with the car   it fit the three of us well   there was an incredible amount of trunk space and i got really wonderful mileage   about   mpg   and then   as i revised   and revised   certain things began to stand out in my mind i am not a tall woman   i am not even five and a half feet tall   and yet   somehow   i managed    of the time to bang my knee getting into the car   i didn t need to readjust the seat or anything   it was back as far as it could roll   this is not a car for the nba   then there was the issue of the trunk   i like having space   but not at the expense of rear seat safety   the contour has one of the folding back seats that instantly increases the trunk space   i am always afraid of being rear ended and getting a passenger impaled as a result   i don t trust the seat latches   most of my driving was normal stuff   which is good   because the contour does not have enough pluck to get you onto the interstate and merging   nor can it accelerate up hill   this might be a good thing if you are trying to cure yourself of speeding   but it drove me nuts   the ergonomics of the air and radio controls were aligned in such a way that i had to wait and read the buttons to see what was where   i don t like reading as i drive   the arm rest between the passenger and driver s seat was interesting   if it was down   you could not use the drink cups   or the storage   and it was so high that i felt like i was resting my arm on a plane level with my heart there are some people this is going to be a great car for   i am not one of them br br  
116,0,  i have purchased   contours in the past   years   my reasoning for buying a contour was the price   i felt i was getting a pretty nice   roomy   some what sporty car for the money   i needed a family car but did nt want a van or suv   with my first contour i had very few problems besides the few recalls   in august of   our contour was in a accident   it had flipped hitting numerous trees before coming to a stop   yes i was very surprised to hear that a contour could be flipped by being ran off the road   but that still did nt bother us we decided to buy another contour in sept     from september to december of   we received   recalls   we returned   times for the same recall   we had numerous problems with our new car   yet we still had faith in our car   until just last week   our car was in another accident   trying to avoid a deer our car swerved as we tried to regain control of the car it also flipped   in neither of our accidents did our air bags go off   but yet they were both considered totaled   i ask how can a semi family car have been so easily turned over not once but twice     
117,0,  i was lucky enough to get to drive my best friend s   contour se for a week   and then drive it from new york state to georgia   i was pleasantly suprised with the overall performance of the car   it felt very solid   but was obviously not well built   the entire top of the dashboard is peeling up near the base of the windshield and it looks awful for a k mile car   also   the small pod that houses the power window switches on the driver s door feels very cheap and flimsy   when you press one of the buttons   the whole pod wiggles and creaks   as if it is going to fall into the door if you press too hard   i was not impressed with this   however   the car feels and sounds very solid overall and i was impressed the engine and transmission performance is questionable   but not terrible   the engine is snappy from a start and is powerful enough on the highway   however   due to it s small displacement of   l   it is weak on hills at any speed   i also think the engine is a bit on the buzzy side   it idles buzzy and is buzzy when revved up   which it likes to do a lot   overall   i think the engine is a good balance of performance and fuel economy at around mpg on the highway   the transmission   although silky smooth   is a slow shifting dog of a tranny   the shifts are very lethargic in nature   the tranny shifts very slowly from gear to gear   this can become a bit annoying in stop and go traffic when the transmsission up shifts even though you are already applying the brakes   i realized that pushing the   overdrive on off   button to keep the car from shifting into overdrive helps the excessive shifting alot the front seating is very supportive with great bolstering to keep your tushy from sliding around during cornering   i was really expecting my butt to be sore by the end of the   hour drive   but it wasn t   i also find the driving position to be very comfortable as well the stereo is a decent standard system   nothing too bad or too great   just adequate   the controls on the stereo are standard issue tick tack size stereo buttons that can be a little tricky to use while driving   the speaker performance seems a little weak   but not horrible   as far as the appearance of the car inside and out   i think it s an attractive car   although i prefer the front end styling of the previous design contour   i love the rear end styling   it s attractive   simple   stylish   and looks like it belongs on a much more expensive car   the interior is modern   attractive   and functional overall   i like the dashboard used on the mercury mystique better though my only major concern with this car is the overall reliability   the trannies rarely last more than k miles   these cars are also plaugued with electrical bugs   good luck to anyone who owns one   overall   it s a very well designed car that was poorly executed  
118,0,  i drove this pathetic little car for a weekend as a rental in detroit   as i pointed out in the review of detroit   my arms were sore at the end of the weekend   i was in town for a wedding and got the cheapo hertz special at detroit airport   i got myself an ugly gold contour that i had to run out through the rain to get from the hertz lot   now   detroit is a car city   right   well   these are some of the worst   most beat up roads i have ever come across   and the fine wheels of the contour were putting all those bumps directly to my arms   this thing felt like it was made of plastic   except for the seats which were way too soft   i am probably a little skewed because of the bad roads   but this car had little going for it   it had all the standard   boring features of a mid size american car   it had little gusto on the freeways   although i didn t get a chance to try it on any hills because there apparently aren t any in detroit   the trunk was nice and big and the windshield wipers fine   the maneuverability was fine   if not well heeled   the sightlines were fine   i think that this car stood out most for what it didn t do   stand out   it was just another boring   bad   lifeless american car   and i know a lot about those   having grown up driving a buick regal and now the proud owner of a mercury sable   pony up a little more and try something besides the safe and boring american car     
119,0,  it s really too bad about my contour   it was an ok price   the car is alot of fun to drive   i have the se version with the   hp v   but   i have the reoccuring no start problem   i go out to start it and about once a month it wo nt start   turns over fine but won t catch   i have had it into   times now and they can t seem to fix it   i am currently intereing into arbitration with on it   it s too bad because when it runs it is a blast to drive   fast as hell   and corners like it is on rails   with the   tires that came standard on the se you can do anything and it will track great   worst cup holders in the world though   i gave up drinking coffee in it after spilling about   fulls cups   also power window controls suck   they are flush with the door and are very hard to operate br br  
120,0,  i have some bad news   and i have some good news   the bad news is that my car is in the repair shop with a leaking gas line   more bad news is i not only have to incur the expense of the repair   but i have to incur the expense of renting a car   as it s a holiday weekend and my car won t be done for several days   and i can t drive it like it is for fear that i ll blow up   now for the good news   i guess   just when i was cursing my car and thinking about buying another   the   contour   has made me appreciate my own vehicle   at least i know i will appreciate it once the repair is done there are three things i like about this     door   contour   that i ve been driving for the past few days   one being the comfort of the driver s seat   two being a nice   cold air conditioner   and three being a fairly roomy back seat   my   geo prism   lacks in those departments   other than those items i mentioned   i ve already decided i would never buy one of these   contour s the first thing i noticed was how loud the engine is   my usual vehicle purrs in comparison   the sound system for the radio isn t as clear as mine   while i mentioned the air conditioner to be nice and cold   it has some drawbacks   too   it s rather noisy and no matter how you set the control   it s never just right   on low it doesn t operate effectively   and on the next notch it blows you away   noise and all   it s almost annoying to think about listening to the radio when it s on   the humidity was horrific in my city today   usually   i just open the window   but today   i had to use the air conditioner   and   i ve got to tell you   if an ambulance or fire truck was in the area i never would ve heard its   sirens   the rental i have   which is the higher end model of the   contour    i lx    does not have power windows and locks   cruise control   or abs brakes   etc   so i can t comment on those   but   for what it does have   i m surprised to say that my   geo prism   gives a more enjoyable ride   at least a less noisy one   however   i d still opt to take a   contour   over my car when going on a very long drive   because the seat gives much more support to my back than mine does this model   contour   is equipped with driver and passenger front airbags   and has a decent looking instrument panel and dash   while giving a nice outward appearance   there is nothing particularly rich looking or feeling inside   nor does this auto have any outstanding features to write home about   and what surprised me the most   not even a cup holder the interior has blah grey cloth seats   again   it s only a rental   so naturally i d customize it if i were buying   so i can t knock the choice of interior or color or features   i did notice something as soon as i rented it   though   and i mentioned it to the rental car representative   first of all   the side moldings of the car   which appear to be made of rubber   were the same exact color as the exterior   while there were no dents to the exterior   it was very noticeable that every scratch on it   whether it be big or small   had turned white   white against the dazzling emerald green is very noticeable   so i guess i d have to make a negative comment about the exterior paint finish   if this is the caliber one is to expect from a   contour    a good finish does not allow every hairline scratch to stick out like a sore thumb   as the   contour   is bigger than my vehicle   i was disappointed to see that its   trunk was only slightly bigger   if bigger at all   than my car s trunk   the depth looked the same   so it amounted to the fact that you can probably fit two large pieces of luggage and no more if you consider the door hinges   they say there s a reason for everything   and a little good will come from something bad   i guess this is true because   while i was very disappointed to have the setback and costly repair and expense associated with my car s problem   i m glad i got to drive a newer car to see just what i was missing   while the   contour   gives a nice appearance and a fairly smooth ride   overall   its   bad features outweigh its   good ones     
121,0,  the reason that i bought my contour   is because we badly needed a dependable car   at least that is what we thought we were getting   on a whim we went to our nearest dealer and started pricing new cars   we were trying to trade in our old piece of junk   but as we found out   we enjoyed our old piece of junk better than our new car we purchased this vehicle in november of    we paid approximately      the salesperson was very helpful and knowledgeable in his field   since november we have had several problems with this car   it has a high idle when coasting in the city and rural roads   usually under   mph   it does excellent on the highway   we have taken several trips from indiana to north carolina and have had no problems to speak of   this vehicle has a lot of room in the front but very little in the back   the side strip molding is falling off   it does not want to stay on very well   there is a constant rattling in the passenger side of the dash board   we have not had to take this car in yet but we are in the process of taking for its first visit to the dealership   this car comes equipped with cruise control   tilt steering wheel   ac   am fm cassette stereo   and a very spacious trunk   also has low profile tires   which the only problem with that is that they are very expensive to replace   the interior and exterior colors are very pleasant to look at   i would not recommend this particular automobile to the average person   this is for the average family of more than three people   i would not buy this car again because of the problems that we have encountered br br  
122,0,  the most negative of my rental experiences i have saved for last   the   contour   if this car had the options like a larger engine than the cyl   a better sound system   better seats   something   then this might only be a mediocre rating   but there were none   it allowed for an entire   days of disappointing driving    outside b visually unremarkable   the contour has the plain lines of a scaled down taurus   the base model has nothing to make it look appealing   it still has s unfortunate taste for ovals dominating it s appearance   fit and finish is fine   it had a smallish trunk that seemed full with two medium bags and a laptop case   the doors are somewhat small   making entry and exit more challenging   the doors are also thinner   and feel flimsy compared to other cars that i have been driving    inside   the seats were small and uncomfortable   the driver s seat reminded me of the long flight that i had just been through   it was a long trip and being unable to get settled simply made it worse   the panel display is flanked by a plastic divider that emphasizes how small the car is   it really worsens the cramped feeling in the passenger cabin   engine noise is loud   with the cyl engine whining at almost every acceleration   it often overpowered the radio which was also whiny when played loud   i could quickly see that this car was not going to make the    hour journey pleasant   it does have the normal package of power windows   and locks   and they are easy to understand and use   the other controls are as easy to understand   but everything in the car has a cheap feel to it   i was consistently nervous that i was going to break something   but generally i was thinking of the engine    driving   this is not a drivers car   at least not with   this   engine   as i dodged the   wheel heavies on the highway out of cincinatti   i wasn t at all confident about the acceleration or the handling of the little   trying to pass a heavy dump truck on a two lane onramp i had the pedal to floor wishing for just some of the horsepower i had left garaged in massachusetts   it was pretty much that way for the rest of the trip   slow pickup   and that only to the tune of the engine whining loudly   iffy handling in turns   i felt the car was at maximum performance at     all around   i won t drive this car again   i began specifically requesting full size cars after this unless i could get a grand am or a at close to the same rate   this car is fine for basic transportation or short trips   but i found it small   underpowered   and uncomfortable     
123,0,  i was in the market for my first car in     and i wanted to be very sure to buy a new car with decent credentials   i shopped around and did my research in the smaller midsize segment s world car triplets   contour and mercury mystique for north america   and mondeo for the rest of the world   caught my attention   there was quite a hype about these vehicles   as had spent    billion to create the infrastructure necessary to design a car that could be sold in just about any country    a concept familiar to the japanese but very foreign to american companies   i do remember that these vehicles were named the european car of the year in   and the north american car of the year in    just about everyone was raving about how these cars drove like the bmw   at only half the price   these were american cars with strong european personalities    after all   most of the design and engineering were done in germany and uk since i was still young   i was looking for a sporty vehicle   not a utilitarian family sedan   that meant that my preference was for european vehicles instead of the reliable but conservative japanese sedans such as honda accord   there was no way for me to consider a four door american sedan   but i made an exception for the contour mystique   knowing that they had european personalities and that the other triplet   the mondeo   was the best selling vehicle in its class in europe   in the end   it came down to a choice between the contour and a true european sedan   the volkswagen jetta   s longer warranty and cheaper price won out to fully exploit the european character   i chose a contour that was equipped with v engine   manual transmission    wheel disc brakes   and a sport package   i felt quite confident   knowing that the only issues known were a few recalls and the rather smallish back seat   in fact   some people were even bragging about putting    miles on their contours   having to replace only the water pump   that was not the case to be for me b styling   inside and out   the exterior is definitely s   with full of bubbles and curves that lead to the model s name   i liked the exterior because it was reminiscent of s other european cars   as opposed to s american models   my only gripe about the exterior is that the rear is just a blob of red lights and reflectors   i personally prefer the more conventional styling of the mondeo   complete with amber turn signals the interior of my   model is a sore loser   compared to the interior in the jetta   the accord   or even lowly cars like the corolla   my contour is absolutely cheap   this wasn t the case when contours first came out for the   model year    those earlier contours felt like high end european sedans inside   with stylish center consoles   useful and covered storage spaces   and well designed switches   in the early contours   the interior lights turned on with a switch next to the light itself   in mine   i must use the dashboard dimmer switch   a cheap american trick i hate   the dimmer switch even heats up when i dim the instrument cluster for rural driving    that s really cheap   even worse   various switches and markings that once had been painted white were now simply embossed in my car   making them harder to see   and the newer center console in my car   it looks so cheap and old it should belong in a tempo or pinto instead the only thing that didn t change    and therefore retained its european character    was the instrument cluster   which is very legible and well lit   on the other hand   while the stalks for turn signals and windshield wipers kept their european look in my car   they feel very cheap when operating   i can even   feel   the click of the turn signal adding insult to injury   the dash was so cheap it warped   it was an issue fixed under a recall i had never heard of   until i had my car towed into a dealership b driving and seating position   at least i didn t feel too bad sitting in the driver s seat   every time i drive   i am treated to a decent seat   a leather wrapped steering wheel with very thick grip   and all switches   however cheap they may be   within easy reach   the seat doesn t have the height adjustment of newer cars   but it does have the standard fore aft and seatback adjustments   the front passenger seat is identical to the driver s seat the rear seat is indeed very cramped   contours are saddled with ridiculously low headlines   and that means the rear seat is farther forward than where it should be   taking away legroom   this   midsize   car is even more cramped than compacts such as the corolla   the civic   or even s own focus    made even worse because of the cheap materials    vinyl door liners belong to taxicabs and police cruisers    and are grossly inappropriate in my car   this is the primary reason why never had success in selling contours and mystiques in north america   and it also explains why increasingly cheapened these models   selling them as heavyweight   v compacts instead of midsize cars they otherwise should have been    eventually   billed the lightweight   compact focus as the contour replacement in north america   while it sells both the focus and a redesigned   larger mondeo in europe   the compensation for the cramped rear seat is a large trunk   unfortunately   fold down rear seat was an option i skipped   and that limits the usefulness of the trunk b performance   at least the bmw comparison was not an exaggeration   i carved mountain curves with ease and cruised highways in style   even going on a    mile road trip in october    steering is very precise   acceleration is decent   and brakes are superb   abs was an expensive option i skipped though   so i must be very careful to avoid emergency braking   before buying my contour   i was used to cars that lean heavily into corners   such as the corolla   this made me really appreciate the performance b quality and reliability   s    billion investment had to have something to show up for it   in my car s case   the engine has proven to be superb   it still runs very smoothly   and there are virtually no signs of the     miles i ve put on it   there is some oil consumption but that is within acceptable limits   splurging on mobil   synthetic oil seems to have helped    but with the rest of the car being pure junk   i don t know if the cost is justifiable anymore ignition system was another matter though   the engine uses distributorless ignition system   and the ignition coil failed for no reason at    miles   after a crazy round of parts swapping   and shopping for nonexistent ignition coils at odd hours   dealers rarely stock these   a dealership finally fixed it    but only after putting in water into the fuel tank and blaming that water for the problems   and charging     to drain the fuel tank the transmission   the other part of the    billion investment   is already history   manual transmissions are supposed to be virtually service free and trouble free   but the third gear is already destroyed   and the clutch has finally worn out   i ve been told that clutches are not supposed to wear out before    miles   even with severe abuse   this means that the clutch in my car was junk to start with   adding insult to injury   clutch replacement will be a very expensive job   because the transmission area in my car is extremely cramped   i remember that owners of the souped up svt contours usually upgraded their differentials   fully knowing that the powertrain was too weak for the engine exhaust is also gone   the   way catalytic converter failed completely   clogging the exhaust path and stalling the engine   it was as if i put in leaded gasoline into my car    something that could never happen these days   i always used the best brands of gasoline possible   usually chevron    leaving even fewer excuses for exhaust failure   perhaps the only excuse left is the water that had been put into the fuel tank by the previously mentioned dealership to blame the ignition failure on   currently i only have one section of the catalytic coverter repaired   at least the exhaust is open again   but fuel economy has dropped by about   miles per gallon   and i will need a complete repair before my next smog test in the interior   rattles are starting to take over   and one of the radio speakers is starting to die   and of course   there was the warping dash which required a recall   in the exterior   rubber window liners are falling apart as well   the left rear door also has an occasional rain leak i can not trace over the years   contours have racked up six recalls    way too many   even the best designed vehicles occasionally have a recall or two   but when there are six recalls   i must wonder what the heck the engineers were doing with their    billion   the focus   s newer and smaller world car   is even worse   with already eight recalls and another four defects under u s   government investigation if money were no object   i would immediately have my contour towed into a junkyard   the engine would be the only thing worth salvaging   and the rest of the car would be no more than scrap metal   in reality   selling the car isn t much better   because the depreciation on contours has been extremely steep   in fact   repairs have already cost more than the value of the car itself b dealer service   has focused too much on its trucks   the average dealer keeps only a dozen or so cars in stock as opposed to hundreds of pickup trucks and suvs   even worse   s suvs are popular because they are yuppie friendly   not because they are capable or well built   what does this mean   i get cut rate service when i bring in my contour   while suv owners get first class service in addition to the dealership that put water into my fuel tank   i also had to deal with dealerships on several other occasions    often over body work   one dealership improperly mounted the engine after the body work   causing my car to rattle in the engine compartment   i repeatedly went back to the dealership   but the body shop workers claimed to never hear it   hoping i would give up   only after six months of complaint did the dealership give in   another dealership chose to book me for body work and recall work on the same appointment   even though the body work was sublet out to an independent body shop next door   which was booked solid for the next two weeks   i ended up having to rent a car twice because the works were done separately    and insurance adjusters weren t happy   at least the body damage was not my fault   and was being paid by the other party s insurance    but i had to do some explaining to avoid rental charges b owner clubs   with the dealerships being so useless   i hoped the owner clubs   particularly the online one at contour org   would be of some help   sure   i did get hints about having to upgrade differentials on svt contours    which in turn meant a weak powertrain that couldn t handle the engine s power   but i found the owner clubs to be of immature minds who have nothing better to do than to street race just about any car in sight   from acura integras to pontiac grand ams   moreover   despite the contour s european roots   many owners were of the isolationist   pat buchanan types   everything from high fuel prices to traffic regulations was from the liberal globalist conspiracy i often judge a car by the types of people who drive them   i believe that driving a certain make and model of vehicle sends out a message about what kind of a person i am   especially since i am in car conscious southern california   given that criteria   the contour fails again miserably   i don t have rush limbaugh or dr   laura pre set in my radio   and i certainly don t have a gun rack or a   buchanan for president   bumper sticker   perhaps if i were living in europe and driving a mondeo   the story could be different   there are quite a few other cars   some of them excellent ones like the honda civic   that i refuse to buy for the same reason    the image of the owners b epilogue   i just returned from a trip to beijing and seoul   while riding on an expressway just outside seoul   i spotted a mondeo cruising alongside me    and mentioned that i drive one back home in the u s   my acquaintances riding with me were rather blunt in their response    overpriced and crappy    that car has no reputation here in korea   get a hyundai instead   even five years ago these people would not have said such things   knowing how bad hyundais were back then   now it s different   even after returning to the u s   and losing the clutch on my contour   the first thing i heard was    next time   get a hyundai sonata instead   considering hyundai s generous warranty   plus the fact that hyundai dealers do care about passenger cars   i m actually agreeing with them   though i would rather buy a japanese car   or even better   a volkswagen if the budget allows   vw has also doubled its warranty as well   it appears that i ll have to start saving up for another vehicle fast   as i will most likely sell or junk my contour before its smog test is due next year the mercury cougar   which has just ended production   is an identical design to the contour mystique mondeo series   differing only with a hatchback sports car body   even jaguar s new small sedan   the x type   is really a mondeo with all wheel drive and lots of leather and wood   i know that i ll stay away from these choices as my next vehicle    and suggest that you stay away from anything based on the contour family   aside from the engine   everything else has been a disappointment   i never thought    billion could result in a car this bad   and if i absolutely need the feel of a bmw    i will have to take out a mortgage to get a real bmw   
124,0,  i should start out by letting you know that i do not know much about cars   but after leasing this vehicle from   i am ready to go back to the horse and buggy   the car has been in the shop more than it has been in my garage   we have leased it for   years and it has already had   recalls   it is extremely limited in space and anyone with small children will regret the day they purchase this lemon has discontinued the model for the   sales year and for good reasons   although you can not purchase this vehicle brand new   i would also discourage someone from buying it secondhand   to top it off   the service department at the is horrendous   they lack professionalism   product knowledge and simple manners   i have to spend a lot time at the garage because of this horrible car and i am not sure if i will purchase another again   the ride in the contour is rough and loud   on a major expressway it feels like you are riding on space mountain   the air conditioner is weak at best and the trunk can barely fit a stroller   i guess i should commend for discontinuing this model br br  
125,0,  the mach   is back for the    model year after an almost   year absence in the lineup   even though the original mach   looks almost nothing like the new version   visually only sharing a shaker hood scoop   spoiler   and mach   logos   they certainly have one major attribute in common   outright performance   like the original   the   version is designed for speed versus touring   many luxury items that would have added weight i e   heated seats   an optional navigation system   a sunroof   etc   are not offered in the mach    in the end the mach   is approximately   lbs lighter than a gt coupe   the has always thrived on its amazing power per dollar ratio   this is definitely the case with the   mach    for the   model year the mach   is only available with s dohc    v   basically the same engine that powered the     cobra s   this engine pumps out   horsepower    more ponies than the sohc v powered gt   thus making the mach   one of the most powerful cars on sale in the u s south of   grand   keeping in tune with performance purposes   a convertible which would have added performance hampering weight   is not on the list this year   a   door coupe is the only body style available with the mach   trim b note b   a   speed manual is standard   a   speed fully automatic transmission is available at      driving impressions b like the original mach    the   version is fast   the    mach   makes it clearly known by its superior throttle response and its burbly exhaust note at both startup and under full throttle that it s not just a stripped down version of the gt trim levels   if you own a     gt don t expect the mach   to be loads faster   though there is definitely a noticeable difference in standing start acceleration b note b   traction control comes as standard equipment a few magazines report the    time of the mach   to be as low as    seconds   which is only a shade faster than the gt   however the mach   provides the driver with much more of a   throw you back in your seat    feeling than the gt   the   speed manual coupled to this dohc v engine makes a great combo   the only major gripe i have here are the throws of the aluminum shifter   they are far too long for quick shifting   the   mach   s shifter offers throws that are more reminiscent of a   escort s manual shifter than a post    performance car s   speed manual shifter   so does the hood scoop really shake at idle like the original   hardly   calls it a shaker hood   though if you don t have    vision you will be hard pressed to see it move   the shaker hood scoop for the    model year is more   cute   than   intimidating    as it once was back in   i cruising   through town or on the freeway is not the smoothest event   although by far surpasses the ride quality of the current generation s predecessor   rattles and odd noises are still an issue with the   however it seems as though with each passing year the s ability to keep the driver in a rattle free environment while cruising gets slightly better   if you don t like the sound of your exhaust rumbling every second you are in your car then you might want to take a pass on the mach    from idle   to redline   to just cruising at   mph in th gear   the exhaust and engine rumble can be clearly heard in the cabin at almost all times   this is one of the mach   s best features to most of the cult following   though i suspect many naive consumers will be overwhelmed by the decibel level in the cabin   the mach   s robust engine exhaust note is unquestionably a case of   you either love it or hate it   unlike many cars on the road that can claim close to the same    and    times as the mach    the mach   exhibits some of the best passing power since the late v camaro s   thanks to a decent amount of torque at a relatively low rpm   the mach   never   needs   to be downshifted while cruising at freeway speeds to accomplish quick passing maneuvers   the same excellent power in top gear is also beneficial for extreme hill climbing   the mach   accomplished every hill i put it up against   up to    grades   with no need to downshift   in fact the mach   was more than happy to accelerate up these inclines in th gear   it seems as though downshifting into th to accomplish these types of road conditions just made for unnecessary engine noise   i have never been overly fond of driving the mustangs on the twisties   despite the grip offered from the big   z rated    tires and the upgraded suspension   the mach   still feels big around turns   unlike the original   however   the    mach   is acceptable on these types of roads   the original mach   was almost scary to drive on twisty back roads   not only did the original require huge arms to turn the vehicle at high speeds   but the tires also seemed to howl at every sharp bend   not the case with the    mach     braking   is excellent   with the   wheel disc brakes coupled with   wheel abs i did not have a problem stopping this vehicle from   mph to a stop   something an owner of the original mach   could only dream of    fuel economy   is acceptable   the mach   is rated at    which gives it about the same epa rating as most of the v powered mustangs from    and most sport oriented cars on the market   one should note that the epa rating of the is sort of a laughingstock among v powered owners   i have never talked to a owner who has received over   mpg   my late    gt averaged about   mpg   most owners whom i have talked with average between    mpg highway   an added problem in this department is that the   mach   requires premium fuel   the gt can run off of regular   with gas prices reaching     in many areas of the world   just for regular   another     cents per gallon for premium is really going to put a hamper on your pocket book   the other downfall here is the small fuel tank   at only    gallons   your local gas stations will most likely be your new hangout    interior b the interior is where my major gripes lie   to start   the instrument cluster gauges are absolutely tiny   these instruments are some of the smallest i have ever seen in an automobile produced by fomoco   why thought that the muscle car enthusiast would want tiny gauges is beyond me   obviously is not catering to enthusiasts with less than perfect vision   the plastics throughout the cabin also feel overly cheap   from the plastic gadgetry   to the door panels   most surfaces feel like they were taken from an era where interior quality was an afterthought   one of my concerns   something i rarely mention in a review   is the sound of the frameless doors when they shut   they sound like they were put together with plastic and glue   i have not heard doors sound this poor in quality while closing since the st generation neon s rolled off the assembly line    on to some positive notes    ergonomics are excellent   as with all mustangs i have driven   all the gadgetry in the mach   is logically placed and easy to use   the leather seats are also a fine asset   these seats are both extremely comfortable and supportive   good bolstering in both the upper and lower portions of the seats   the premium seats found in the mach   are completely different from the less desirable leather seats found in the gt or the v powered trim levels   both the driver and front passenger seats offer manual adjustments    way driver    way passenger   rear seating is unfortunately made of a cheaper type leather   this leather visually matches the more expensive front leather seats   however there is a definite difference in the texture and quality of the rear seating surfaces   as mentioned   the   mach    is not   loaded to the brim with embellishments   though the mach   does come standard with enough equipment to satisfy most consumers looking for a car in this particular market   some standard amenities on the mach   include dual front air bags   a decent sounding mach   am fm   disc in dash cd system with   speakers   ac   power door locks   windows   titanium pedals    cup holder   two   volt power outlets   cruise control   etc   since the mach   is basically a package in itself there are not too many options beyond the standard equipment   in fact   other than the optional automatic transmission     the only other optional package that will cost you money is the interior upgrade package     this interior upgrade package gives you stainless steel pedals   an aluminum shift knob   and chrome accents   for more info on standard and optional equipment you can visit     the mach   might look like a roomy coupe   though it is anything but   the remains one of the tightest fits next to the late camaro coupe   up front   the driver and front passenger should have enough room   being     and my passenger     we both had enough room to stretch our legs and necks   the rear   however   is a different story   not only is leg room next to none   but head room is also limited   having owned a   gt nothing has changed   for the better   in this department over the years   for future reference   the redesigned    models are said to have a much roomier back seat b note b   the mach   can seat up to   adults stowage space is actually not as bad as some people might think   with the rear    seats folded completely down   the mach   can easily hold   weeks worth of groceries   my    gt   which was equally as roomy   enabled me to haul around new computers   huge vacuum cleaner boxes   etc   etc   with no problem   one should note that even though the does come with a glove box   it will probably only fit a few parking tickets b exterior b   the mach   is definitely a good looking muscle car and by far looks the most aggressive out of the lineup   including the cobra   the major head turning feature of the mach   is the raised hood with shaker scoop resting at the top   the mach   also comes with an air dam   larger tires with very attractive   spoke heritage chrome wheels   spoiler   and large mach   logos to help segregate this car from its less powerful siblings   if a mach   is a must on your shopping list   i highly suggest checking out a mach   dressed up in black paint   models that are painted   black   do not carry a painted racing stripe which   in my opinion   makes this stang appear more tacky than aggressive b price   warranty b there is definitely one thing about the mach   that you can count on   a relatively low price   with only   options available   the mach   tops out at just under      about     less than the cobra   and about     more than a fully loaded gt   door coupe   if anything happens to your mach    unfortunately offers one of the   worst   standard warranties on the market   a   year    mile bumper bumper warranty   an extended warranty can be purchased at an extra cost    final thoughts b i do like the mach    though i do not recommend it for a few reasons   most notably due to the tawdry interior   desperately needs to updated the interior with richer materials   increase the standard warranty by at least a few years and another    miles   and give this car a better shifter   i do   however   recommend the mach   over the gt trim levels   even though acceleration may not be that much better than the gt   which is already great   the mach   is much more comfortable and will undoubtedly be a collectors car in the future   i definitely forecast much better resale value with the mach   over the gt willing to sacrifice a few seconds off your    time and the backseat of the mach   for a more refined sports car   you may want to check out     a href content    my review on the nissan z a      thanks for reading
126,0,  there is a great deal of history to contend with when talking about the   its appeal to a large segment of american drivers is impressive   and to some degree a lover will not be swayed by better performance found in foreign automobiles    that s not the point   their loyalty is to the brand first and foremost with that history of loyalty has also come a great tradition of performance tuning these cars   so that there are several appealing options available to someone who has some money to spend   and wants a true high end performance machine   they will all cost you   though   the produced cobra svt starts at about     while both saleen and roush make impressive models that will cost          or more this review   however   concentrates on the models at the other end of the scale   the entry level   affordable coupe   the base comes in three option levels   standard   deluxe   and premium   starting at about      and going up    or so with each level engine drivetrain the base comes with a    litre v which makes   hp and   lb ft of torque   it is a dramatic step down from the v available on the higher end models   both in performance   and aesthetics   where the v has the throaty growl you expect from a muscle car   the v of course does not   married to   speed automatic   it is relatively quick   but not overly impressive   especially in the low end   you ll be able to merge into traffic and pass without discomfort   but is that really the performance level you want if you re buying a    i think we re looking for a little more performance   and to get it   you need to step up to the v the transmission is another sore spot   if you have to get the v   stay with the default   speed manual instead of upgrading to the automatic   you maximize the performance   of the engine   and still get some performance   feel   with the stick   but the automatic is awful   early shifts   still some lag when you mash the pedal    not good   the automatic increases your price by almost     so i wouldn t bother unless you have to for those who have grown up on today s front wheel drive vehicles   it is also worth noting that this is a rear wheel drive car   yes   it comes with traction control now   but you will still be surprised if you get into rain or snow and try to gun the engine   the rear end is twitchy   and you ll have a hard time getting it back into shape once it goes exterior the retains its burly   muscle car appearance   the high rear end   and sloping windshield into the   fake   hood air intake give it its distinctive appearance that ensure you won t be confused with any other car on the road   that definitely has some appeal in an era when you sometimes can t tell the jaguar x type from a taurus   individuality is good   with that said   some of the old fit and finish concerns remain   the covers on the fake air dams are flimsy and look ready to come off at a moment s notice   those air dams are another pet peeve   it smacks of pretend performance to include the hood   intake   with those behind each door   they re not functional for my money   you can leave them off next year   the available   on the premium model    inch machined aluminum wheel are a positive   though   they re beefy   sporty   and fit well with the style interior remember that you re essentially buying a detuned sports car   so the interior is not necessarily designed for touring   you slip down into the bucket seats   and while they re not impossible to get in and out of   some may find the extra effort needed to accomplish this annoying   when inside   the seats are comfortable enough   though if you re any taller than me      you may be a little cramped   controls are conveniently located   and are standard issue   the leather wrapped steering wheel available in the premium model is a nice extra touch   while on the road   a driver unfamiliar with the may have a few complaints   wind noise   while reduced from earlier model years   is still more noticeable than it should be   part of the price you pay for that distinctive appearance   in addition   be aware that visibility is not on par with a larger   higher ride sedan   again   part of the price you pay for getting into a   sports car   where you sit low the rear seats are utile   but not overly comfortable   children will have no problem sitting there   but larger adults will be somewhat cramped   especially on longer rides miscellaneous includes some decent options   remote keyless entry    way power driver s seat   and an in dash   cd changer are standard in the premium model   the abs and traction control are also nice   and offset a bit the difficulty drivers may experience with the rear wheel drive conclusion markets the to a very specific market of american drivers who appreciate the history   the muscle car feel   and aren t looking for a cookie cutter accord or camry to drive around   for about   grand   you get a decent ride   a distinctive appearance   and reasonable power   the trade offs are iffy quality   some slightly old technology in the engine   transmission   and design   and poor visibility   if you re comfortable with that trade   this is the car for you   if true performance is your goal with the   consider stepping up to the higher end models available from either or one of the performance tuning outfits like saleen or roush  
127,0,  this entry level version of the iconic pony car looks muscular   from the flared wheel arches to the bumped up hood to the angled real lights and the agressive   mean    front headlights   overall   though not classy or subtle   i find the shape attractive loading up luggage is not a piece of cake   the boot is deep and wide   but the narrow opening makes it rather difficult to insert big items   a large size suitcase can barely be inserted   and as a result blocks access to the remainder of the trunk space   while on the topic   the glovebox is very small too   the instrument panel is clearly laid out   looks the business   standard radio cd works decently   but the old fashioned telescopic antenna sticking out of the front right wing is anachronic   the headlights switch is a surprising design detail   i don t know if it echoes a feature of the original mustangs   but its looks and its feel are really out of place   pulling on this button and hearing a whine when you rotate it to adjust the instrument backlight is the kind of heritage that contemporary buyers will easily want to do    without the front seats are not uncomfortable   but lateral support came really short of my expectations   exploring the grip limits is a spine bending experience and makes you feel really uncomfortable   the fabric they are made off is cheap synthetic stuff   and the fit between parts forming the dash and central console does not leave a lasting impression of quality   wide gaps   mistalignment   leagues behind german   japanese   or maybe even korean standards the steering wheel   while a tad too big in diameter   offers good grip   an adequate thumbs in position   and is thick enough   the steering column feel remains quite numb however   the steering is not overly assisted   but does not communicate much about what s happening under the front wheels if i were to single out the one thing i disliked most about the car   it would certainly be the   speed   or rather    overdrive as i later discovered   auto transmission   start from the fact that the gear change is located ridiculously far forward on the central console to be naturally within reach   the th   overdrive   gear is   as frequently   ridiculously long   making it really usable for highway cruising but a real annoyance in mid speed winding roads   as the overdrive engages as soon as you lift the throttle   it makes uphill or downhill driving a frustrating experience   nd feels too short   the only remedy is to play with the overdrive off button concealed on the side of the lever   took me a while to discover it   another gripe   the car i had was new    miles   but the transmission sounded like a    miles yellow cab   with a vacuum cleaner noise in st and nd gear   torque converter    which sounded out of place at best   worrying at worst   upshifts were not too smooth   contemporary gearboxes can achieve much better results   and downshifts felt busy and clumsy   not the seamless power on demand response you can obtain from german or japanese   speed automatic gearboxes the engine itself is decently torquey   max torque is reached at   rpm according to the spec sheet and the car feels that way   but   for the sake of comparison   a gm v like the pontiac grandam s is far more convincing   both in terms of grunt and noise   redline is low    rpm   and there is little incentive to rev it up that high   the engine does not sound rev happy at all   the car   equipped with standard   inch wheels   felt decently planted on its wheels   with grippy   tires   turn in remained a bit lazy but the body roll is kept well in control    the goes where it is requested to   but there would be about as much feel as with a playstation game   visually    inchers would not look or feel out of place at all   the rear displays a hint of mobility   read tendancy to oversteer   although it is quickly tamed by the   switchable   anti skid control   the absence of a blocking rear differential may cause occasional inner rear wheel spin   especially on the wet   if you are seeking to be the king of power slides in the neighborhood   a v gt may be a better solution   the live rear axle is clearly perceivable through occasional sideways wobbles on uneven roads   not overly disturbing at a restrained pace   but likely to upset the car s balance at the limit   i would say that the chassis is good enough to cope with the hp of the base v without too much drama   but without too much competence and margin either  
128,0,  this was my third car and my second   my first was the    i bought from my neighbor on my th birthday   i loved that car   it was a shame the drunken redneck ran over it with his pickup truck   my next car was a   corolla   completely serviceable   never had a problem   but very boring when i decided i wanted something new   my first thought was an suv   i was looking at cars when they drove in a truck full of mustangs   i hadn t really seen the new body style at that time and wasn t thinking because of the boxier ones of the mid and late   s   but this car was beautiful   it was the first that said    i m a   since the early   s   i probably bought the car because of my first   it was nostalgia as much as anything else   second reason was that i wanted a sports car again   i could feel myself aging at the time   i was all of   and about to graduate from college   and i wanted a fun car again before i settled down   third reason   it was a v at v prices what do i love about my   i live in one of the busiest driving cities in america   the average speed on atlanta highways is about   mph   in the left lane   you have to do almost   to stay alive   my can do that   plus   i can the out of staters and foreigners who don t know how to drive in atlanta and are freaking out in the left lane while driving    third   and probably the best thing   i can hit the gas on that v and leave everyone in the dust   well almost everyone   what is not good about this car   space   there isn t any   if you have to carry much more than yourself   you re in trouble   another thing is the jealous idiots   i have actually caught someone urinating on my car   his friend was keying it at the time   last problem   rear wheel drive   if you are somewhere icy   you probably know that a rear wheel drive vehicle is less stable   when i lived in tn during the ice storms   i had trouble in some areas and would fishtail   while a   is fun on purpose   it really sucks when it s an accident   finally   my butt starts to hurt if i have to sit in the chair for more than   hours at a time so   who gets the car   young people   single people   people with good driving records who can afford the insurance   if you aren t that person   or if you have more than two people you carry around with you on a regular basis   this isn t the car for you update   blew a head gasket at    miles   apparently   the v also has a problem with this   and knew about it and claims they sent out a service bulletin to inform owners   but they sent it to the wrong address and i never got it   i was just over the extended warranty on it and they wouldn t fix it   repair would cost more than the car is worth  
129,0,  if you look around high school and college campuses around the united states you will notice one thing is similar about all of them   that is the number of mustangs parked in the dorms and student parking lots   i remember as a younger driver   i always wanted a piece of the good old american muscle car and had narrowed my choice to a    fastback and a    mach    as my opinions differed and i grew up i noticed that the car i once held on to in my dreams became less appealing to me   it was a simple explanation really   i wanted to be different and how could i manage that without giving up the as a car choice   granted up til    the engines were    liter and it seemed that the    gt was the fastest gt on the market   the one thing i could not overlook was the number of them on the road   i knew of two friends from high school who had consecutive models of mustangs   one was a    cobra and the other a    gt    liter and that really discouraged me from buying one of my own   another thing i encountered was the actual materials used to make a   my junior year of high school a friend and i were in a car accident involving a and an explorer   needless to say i was furious at what i saw constituting as a front bumper on a   styro foam   granted it was hard styro foam   the fact remained it was styro foam instead of some material more solid   for that i made my decision final   a was not for me   now i am not knocking any lovers down for their opinions but i am saying that when it comes to actual muscle cars of the nineties   this old boy will stick with the chevy corvette br br  
130,0,  i enjoy the style of this car and its sleek design   one of the best features of this car is that it is a and a is a reliable car which can be trusted to last a long time   my friend has a coba and he got a special paint job done that makes it three different colors when looked at through different angles   the ride is very smooth and the power is fenominal   the front is a great feature wich makes this car stand out som much and this car will make your heads turn   the power of this car can really be felt right when you turn the car on and you feel the reve of the engine and the feeling of power under the hood   if your looking for a great car at a great price   then put the convetable cobra on your test drive list     
131,0,  i am the proud   well   sometimes proud owner of a     i have found other owners of the same type of car as well   however   it s strange because we have all seemingly had the exact same problems with our cars   i bought this car in   and here are the following repairs that i ve had done on it since then   i bought the car with    miles on it   so it was fairly new august   gaskets had to be replaced   found in many pieces fan had to be replaced   found in many pieces fan blown out several hoses replaced due to fragmentation and tears september   gaskets replaced for nd time   found in one piece november   clutch had to be replaced   at this time i was at    miles   found in many many many pieces march   new tires destroyed when wheels somehow tear through them june   had a total car tune up done   spent almost    to get car in good shape september   gaskets blown out for rd time   found in several pieces hole in radiator october   gaskets blown out for th time   found in several pieces january   belts replaced and gaskets blown out again   th time april   new tires needed as alignment mysteriously got put off and the tires were just bought not even a year ago and have a k warranty on them   only k miles have been put on car since the tires were bought april   new brake pads   rotors   brake kit   etc needed on front and back brakes now   i ve compared this with other reports from other owners of the same car and i ve found continuing problems with the gaskets being blown out and parts actually exploding   rather than just wearing away   i had taken it to several different repair places so that i made sure it wasn t just the repair centers   but it was actually the car   i ve found another   owners of the same year with exactly the same gasket   radiator   and basically cooling system problems   so   i m pretty much starting to assume that their is a major design flaw in the and that something needs to be fixed or these cars need to be recalled and looked at   it s becoming quite expensive to fix them all i love the and i know the older cars are worthwhile   but i m starting to doubt the newer models   i ve heard more bad than good about the never models and their repairs than anything   be very cautious br br  
132,0,  well   here s your lemon story   i bought a     v   new from the dealer   i loved the car   the body style   the interior    everything   at   miles a fuel injector was replaced   at   was replacing my engine   not to mention the horror story of the dealership wars   after that it was constant    i had an electrical short in the tape deck that no one could ever find   my oil pressure guage didn t work and was replaced   the emergency brake was replaced and the window mechanism was replaced   times and i still had problems   needless to say   the car was eventually bought back and i received a   v   i ve had this for almost   years and no problems yet   definately love the car   now the only drawback is the snow and ice    mustangs are sleds in the winter br br  
133,0,  parents   beware i am now   years old   i bought a     years ago   i dreamed of having this car since i was a little girl however   i really wanted the older models   anyway   i ended up purchasing a red one    cylinders   very good condition   however   it proved to be a very dangerous item on the road   i had little experience driving fast cars   this pony has terrible handling in bad weather   a little rain and you will hydroplane all the way to the hospital   its too light on the rear   fishtailing became a regular problem   i had an accident already on a draw bridge   i lost control on that metal surface flooring of the draw bridge   it had only rained for five minutes   a little water is all it took and i almost ended up on the canal   i purchase tires design to handle better in the rain   but it still handles awful   a teenager who has never driven a sports car may come to have their first accident in this pony   many young people pull up next to me to race   it is a temptation that many teens are not willing to pass up   also   it is rather small inside   the back seat is not comfortable for friends to sit and relax   there is noise in the cabin   also   he may need to get a second job so he can fill up the tank twice week    each time    in other words   buy your teen a relic for his first   years of driving   after that   he ll learn on his own when he sees how many of his friends have wrecked their   stangs   he might settle into a roomy nissan maxima   
134,0,  well i for one am personally glad they stopped making the probe   i actually love the look of the car   it was my first choice for a new car just coming out of college   back in the early   s the look of the probe did not really move me   but when they redesigned it i totally fell in love with it   for over a year it was the only car i wanted   well in   i purchased a brand new   probe   it was the last one on the lot in the perfect shade a green the actual color i had been dreaming about   well from then on it was a jinx   within my first month i had to get a brand new set of breaks because they started squeaking two week after i got the car   afterwards i continued to have minor problems with it   such as alignment and so on   but i stilled loved the car because it was so cute   then for some reason my engine locked up   right after christmas   i could not understand it because i got regular maintenance   well thank goodness for extended warranties   well i put the car in the shop to get a brand new   and when i went to pick it up from the service dealer low and behold someone had hit my car and completely tore the rearview mirror off the passengers   side   well of course they offered to pay for it but i had to bring it back on the following monday so they could get me a loaner car   well before i could get it back to them monday morning   another car hit me and totaled my car   well i was faced with getting a new car and i chose the   probe   stupid me   three months after getting the car my transmission goes out   completely   i m still thankful for warranties since then it had never really driven right   the performance of the car used to be so good   greta pick up   speed ect   but the problem you encounter are sickening   after talking to some other probe owners they have all encountered difficulties with the car   i m really sad that such a good looking car has so many problems under the hood br br  
135,0,  ok   i finally went and did it   i took a test drive in the redesigned version of my truck   i guess i was kind of happy to be blissfully ignorant there for awhile   i was so in love with my    regular cab that i didn t want to have the myth shattered by driving the new one and risking disappointment   but   nevertheless   my curiosity got the best of me and i began to realize it s been awhile since i did a review on an actual car   so off it was to my nearest dealership to see what they ve done with my truck i was quite surprised to find that they let me take the test drive alone   not unhappy   mind you   but surprised   i was standing there while they put on the temporary plates expecting the salesman to jump into the passenger seat   but he just said    you know the area well   in response to my nod he tossed me the keys and said    enjoy the ride   all the better for you   the reader   as i was able to get a better idea of performance than if i d had to treat it with kid gloves equipment and options   i drove a   xlt with the extended cab   four doors   rear jump seats   sliding rear windows   air   power mirrors   locks   and windows   anti lock brakes   and the premium stereo with cd and cassette   quite a nicely equipped truck   there was nothing else in particular i thought i might need   in fact   i thought i could do without the cruise control   which i personally don t like to use   but it was a nifty feature for those interested   all in all   a very good bargain considering that it stickered for     exterior   i m not too pleased with it   to be honest   the front has been drastically redesigned   while the rear is only slightly touched up with a lightly modified tail light treatment   the front makes this truck look far too much like a utilitarian appliance   with homely looking headlights on either side of a rather boring looking grill   it doesn t look as bad though with the body colored grill and bumper   my only problem with the tail lights was that it always seems weird to me when the white back up lights are on top of the cluster   as was the case here   the white looks better on the bottom   i know   i know   a strange hang up to be sure   but it s the way i feel   overall   this truck is not particularly ugly or repulsive   just boring looking   they would have done much better by modifying the front fascia on the    than they did with this one   if it were white i might have trouble distinguishing it from my washing machine the cast aluminum deep dish wheels are beautiful   i believe they had five spokes   they re a carryover from previous years and probably my favorite rim that comes with this truck   the   inch wheels and tires looked a bit small in the wheel wells though   i d probably need to go for a x or an edge x with something a bit bigger   perhaps some   s the bed was a styleside   not those uselessly small flareside setups you see on some street trucks   the tail gate had the same removal system as the one on my truck   which is extremely easy and convenient   pop two latches   flip the gate to about a   degree angle   and pull it out   the whole thing takes maybe   seconds it took me awhile to figure out what these weird looking things on the side bed rails were   i don t know if was trying to come up with some sort of futuristic looking tie down bar or what   but it seems like they re for style more than anything else   they look like cheap   gaudy body cladding   except that it was on the rails instead of on the lower body panels   i guess it was an honorable attempt to blend bed rail protection with cargo securing tie downs   so i do give them points for that   but the tie downs on these rails were actually pretty difficult to use   as they were hidden out of sight beneath their protruding lips   if i get one   which is doubtful   i will put on real stainless steel tie down bars   not those cheap looking plastic pieces of junk grade   c   for the exterior   get rid of those bed mounted tie downs and change the front fascia interior   as you might guess   i was less and less eager to get in the longer i looked at the truck   but i had already gone this far   the first thing i noticed was the vastly improved seats   my s    split bench offers almost no lumbar support   causing small aches to develop in my lower back after a couple hour s driving   the seats on this s    split bench were excellent for a truck   i could feel very good contouring at my lower back   right where the seats on previous got really flat   there was also good thigh support and noticeably more side bolstering   not sports car like by a long shot   but it was nice to actually feel the seats curve up just a bit to keep me in place in tight curves the interior was a charcoal grey with black accents for the door handle   instrument gauge   and the radio housing   it looked a bit more upscale than the lighter colors   and the only parts that really looked cheap were the smooth plastics on the black inserts   this was a four door model   which made access to the rear area very easy for placement of groceries and luggage   one thing i would like to see on the that i ve found in the tundra   but no other four   door pickup   is handles on the outsides so you don t have to go though opening the front door first to get the rears open the jump seats back there are still a joke   i wouldn t even put small kids back there because they d be unsafe in a crash due to the inward facing seating position   and those are the only people who would be comfy back there   of course   it s only fair to remind you that pretty much every pickup in this segment except the dakota   with its forward facing rear bench   tells that same joke   and you ll have to look at the extended cabs in full sized trucks or consider the light duty crew cabs if you want rear seating that is at least endurable in a pickup   any adults who are not shaped like children will not be happy after more than a short    minute hop in those seats   which is about how long it usually takes for their novelty to wear off   the cup holders for those jump seats are an even crueler joke since no one should really be back there   the cup holders for front passengers are still in a bad place   placed on the floor of the cabin where they re difficult to reach   i d prefer a setup like i see on some s s where they unfold from the front of the center console   but one now has a removable carrying case for hot thermoses and other drinks the glove box is deep enough to be very useful   but that was about the limit of the lockable hidden storage inside the cab   the only other storage was a map pocket in each door   a locking bin under one of the front seats would be a welcome touch   i did like the special compartment for the jack though   on my truck it was just thrown back there haphazardly the gauges are all simple and clear   pretty much standard issue equipment since the early nineties   they have nice big white letters   you get engine and oil temperature gauges   a speedometer   fuel gauge   one to measure battery charge   and a tachometer   all the information i would wish to know   a useful twelve volt power outlet is displayed prominently next to the radio   this should be a very convenient way to run power tools and other small appliances off the battery   buttons to operate the power accessories are on the door armrests   they were big   clear   and easy to figure out   visibility was a big problem though   i get really annoyed nowadays at what seems too much of a willingness on the part of manufacturers to sarifice safety for style   sleek   tiny side view mirrors may integrate well with a car s body   but they make for anoying blindspots   the rear view mirror was not long enough   the side view mirrors were too small and weirdly shaped   they angled upward sharply on the inside lower corner   right at a big blind spot   buttons on the radio were big and fat and clearly marked   it s too bad really   the radio was very easy to use and offered dual media capabilities   but it offered flat   weak bass   however   it did have clear   finely detailed sound   the tape deck was a full logic unit with seek and scan functions   always an impressive thing to me   definitely not powerful enough in the low ranges for my ears though   i would have to either specify that ground pounding   watt plus unit that will soon be available in the edge or just order the cheapest radio i can get and swap it out for an after market system i noticed much more head   hip   shoulder   and legroom all around up front   the has now finally improved from liveable to very comfortable   with the much improved seating and increased space   when i put the key in i noticed that that stupid latch by the ignition that you need to push to release it is finally gone   thank god   however   the foot operated emergency brake no longer clicks when applied   something i missed   it just feels more reassuring when you can hear it go down to the last click when putting it on overall   a   for the interior   it was much improved   almost all serious shortcomings from previous models were addressed   with just a few annoyances left ride   i started it up and pulled into traffic   one of the first things i noticed was the extremely low engine noise levels   the new    purrs like a kitten and makes smooth   refined noises at all speeds   none of the coarse   boomy quality of the old push rod engines the noises that really got to me came from wind   my    does not push air as loudly at over   mph as this one does at    one step forward in cost reduction for   one step backward for noise levels   this is one loud truck   i believe the wind noise would slowly drive me insane on long trips   and that damn stereo isn t even powerful enough to overcome it small bumps were well damped and never particularly jarring   the big ones really upset the cabin though and even elicited some rattles ride   gets a b   that would be vastly improved if they didn t skimp on sound deadening materials handling   body lean was very limited   and the truck felt sharp and agile in all situations   the steering was heavier than on some previous models i ve driven   including my own   allowing for much better road feel and requiring fewer inputs to plot a straight ahead course on the highway   i felt just a tiny bit of rear end floatiness at high speeds   but it was barely noticeable   in rapid high speed transitions there were no excess body motions   even at over   mph   it was the same over and over   i steered sharply   the truck turned to its new course   and that was it   no bobbing and weaving   and what s best   on some tire spinning maneuvers that always upset the rear axle in my   this truck stayed composed and glued to the ground   in low speed parking lot maneuvers it seemed to require fewer twists of the wheel in tight turning   braking was always straight and secure   though the brakes didn t grab quite as aggressively as i would have liked on sharp application handling   a good   solid a   the truck points where you want it to go with no drama or excess body motions    acceleration   this truck s biggest glaring weak point besides wind noise   i just never felt like the    v and the automatic transmission were working as a team   they felt more like enemies to me    downshift now   screamed the throttle    who s gon na make me   huh tough guy   are you   is the defiant reply from the transmission   the power curve is weak   sure   you do get a sharp kick when you floor it from a stand still   things get quite boring after about   seconds though   as it gets weaker and weaker towards the mid ranges   there was a noticeable and disappointing lack of pulling power at medium and high speeds without a down shift   and those down shifts were slow and reluctant   usually coming    seconds after i asked for them   passing power at higher speeds was ok because this likes to rev and makes good power at higher rpm s   but it still wasn t great even in lower gears   i had a feeling this had more to do with the   speed automatic s gearing than any inadequacy on the part of the new     and the transmission still had a tendency to leave me hanging   in general it didn t seem intuitive at all   and two different times at a stand still i could feel the idle skip ever so slightly   i wasn t sure if it was an engine problem or a torque converter problem   but it was not reassuring   the    does not come with stick right now   or so i hear   guess that means i will not be going with the     the automatic just seemed to suck up too much of this engine s potential acceleration   the engine could use a flatter power curve with more low speed torque and both a manual transmission and an improved automatic   c   sorry to say overall tally   b   but let me emphasize that it just barely missed a c   the great ride   handling   and increased capacity really helped raise the grade my advice to fans considering this truck   hold on to your older a little while longer   the   redesign is not the huge step forward it would seem   it seems almost like a mediocre stop gap measure to fill in until the totally new truck arrives   wait until the complete redesign coming up in   to see if the can regain its greatness  
136,0,  nick bought our little navy blue   brand new   years ago with all of   miles on it   by   miles the trouble had begun and they just culminated in a disaster that almost got me killed last week the is the little truck   ours is a regular cab and regular bed    wheel drive    speed manuel   nothing fancy or special    cyl     l   it got relatively good gas mileage   i m guestimating about    mpg   it s a cute little truck   resembling the chevy s pretty closely the cloth interior was fairly easy to keep clean and for a bench seat in a truck   was actually pretty comfy   as comfy as it could possibly be for what it was it wasn t a race car so i didn t expect it to be fast   but it actually did handle much better than i anticipated   i scared nick the way i took curves sometimes   for a truck   it handled curves pretty impressively actually when the brakes worked   they worked well   i could stop that thing on a dime   yes   there actually were times in between repairs that i did enjoy driving this little truck the trouble began with the clutch fluid   see   the thingy is   inside   the bell housing on the   which is pretty odd   at about   miles it started leaking   first we were having to add fluid like every other month   then every month   then every day   we finally took it in and had the unit changed about   years ago   it was fine for   month   then we had to start adding fluid again every month   you get the picture   pain in the butt the oil was the same way   i had to add oil every   miles or so about   years ago some hoses went out   easy enough to replace a hose   right   go in to the auto parts store and tell em ya want the hose to fit the     sure they have that   errr wait   it doesn t fit   there is no hose that fits   as a matter of fact   that hose was jerry rigged   at the factory    i kid you not   you could see where they had to heat it and stretch it to get it to fit   real nice   eh we ve gone through clutches and had the transmission redone once   accessories broke like clockwork   the brakes didn t last as long as they should   what else   ooooh yeas   the electrical system   we have jet skiis and a dual trailer   one year we decided to tow them on down to key west for christmas as our present to ourselves   about half way there   the lights went out   we bought a fuse   it blew   this continued the entire trip   i m not sure what got replaced finally to end that nightnmare   but it sucked this thing was just one problem after another for ten years   it was paid off   so we kept dealing with it   we should have gotten rid of it years ago   it made that decision for us last monday i had just gotten back from the shop   new tires all around   new brakes   and oil change   got the safety inspection sticker on monday afternoon   so i decide to drive up to dc to see nick who has been working up there during the week   i get to the draw bridge and clank clunk screech   can t shift   can t move   dead in the middle of a slight curve on a damn draw bridge and the damn truck can not even be pushed out of the way   it s totally seized up at   am   the cars rushing past are barely swerving out of the way in time to avoid a major firey crash   i m standing there in the middle of the night leaning on my cane in tears and there is absolutely nothing i can do about anything   this was not fun   i now have a mental block when it comes to fords   i ll never by another one   luckily   a tow truck happened along on his way home about   minutes later and blocked the lane with his flashing lights   then got me towed to safety   even though i had no cash on me i double t towing   of college park   md is owned by tony and he is a sweetheart   i paid him the next day so now it s dead   and i am not going to resurrect it   we re donating it to some place for the tax credit   cutting our losses as much as possible   i mean we had just put over    into it that weekend   grr argh i do not recommend buying   anyone can get a lemon   that s true   but you have to consider the hose issue   any that sells a vehicle new off the show room floor with jerry rigged parts is a that i do not want to do business with   ever you ve been warned  
137,0,  well when i was test driving trucks i drove several late model compact pickups before finally decided on my   xlt   one of them is another   a stripped base model i found on the same lot   at first   my parents thought   cheap   low mileage   let s go for it   so i had a closer look   this was a stripped   and i mean totally stripped   base model   no air   no tape deck   vinyl flat bench   manual everything   dough nut looking little tires   and that was pretty much it   there wasn t even any power steering   this was a barest of the bare bones models   designed to be a work vehicle   it seems like little trucklets like this one are the ones predestined from the factory to become those rough running    mile little rust buckets with springs that sag from constant overloading but my parents liked the price so i gave it a quick test drive   well   what can i say about the interior on this truck   well   it s a place where you sit   the vinyl floor isn t particularly attractive   so if you like quality looking materials look elsewhere   but it should be easy to hose out after muddy boots have made their mark   the numbers on the gauges are nice and easy to read   with the steering wheel made so the spokes do not block the view of the panel   the controls are simple   large   and easy to read   probably because there are no options so you don t have that many to clutter up the dash   the dash is the older square shape   before the interior was redesigned a couple years later   the plain   flat   rectangle and square shapes do not bulge and curve like the dashboards on later models   so everything is moved a bit farther away from the driver s reach and i found i had to look down more to operate the radio and heat controls   i missed the center armrest that usually makes it easy to rest your elbow while your hand works the controls   did i mention no air   or no tape deck   the am fm radio was tinny and fuzzy   but good enough to break up the monotony of lunch break at the construction site by the way i see more xlt s at work sites than strippers by far   maybe even working men like their creature comforts the flat vinyl bench was   well   a place to rest your rear end   not much more   not designed for hours of comfortable cruising   just plain functional   there were also no headrests   which i find unforgivable in even the most stripped pickup made in the   s then there was that power steering   wait   no   i m confusing this with post stone age models   there was none   i ll admit   that s one less thing that might eventually break or require extra maintenance   but me and my parents ended up deciding it was worth it   just try turning the wheel for the first ten seconds or so after start up before you get going and the steering warms up and effort gets lighter   i dare ya   with trucks like this who needs to lift weights   just try maneuvering through a tight parking lot and you can get all the workout you need handling was what could be expected with such a basic suspension setup   this truck sits low and is stiffly spung so it leans a little less that you might expect   but those puny   millimeter wide tires give out fast   and those leaf springs with a solid rear axle make for a nice dance number in bumpy corners   ride damping was   well   truck like   small bumps close together made it dance   the bigger ones were actually absorbed fairly well   just a solid   wump   with the suspension taking a good bit of the punishment before it reached the passengers   of course   the really big pot holes gave me a headache   sound deadening was probably another area where did a little skimping   as the engine noise was ever present the little     banger does its job well in my truck   and in this truck it has considerably less weight to pull so i never felt like it lacked power   merging into street traffic was pretty easy with the   lb feet of low end torque that motivates what must be a sub   pound truck   highway merging or passing are a different matter all together   you can do it   you just have to thrash this truck at   rpm or maybe a little more   where it starts to get coarse and boomy   i don t recommend shifting below fourth at those speeds   but it gets tempting as it only pulls in th in ideal conditions and it only pulls in fourth over about   mph all in all   a work truck and no more   it does not presume to be a commuter vehicle or a highway cruiser   it is a work vehicle   to be used and abused until it falls apart   which should take quite awhile because of the lack of fancy extras or electronics that may be likely to develop problems in the future   if you absolutely have to have a truck and it s all you can afford go for it   with the reminder that this vehicle will not be much fun as a daily driver   best left to those who need a reliable work horse ok maybe more like a work pony   and don t care about any options or frills   me   i m quite happy that we paid a little more for my   xlt with    split bench and center console   tape deck   and rear sliding window   i strongly advise using some of the money saved by ordering the most basic power train and suspension for interior upgrades br br  
138,0,  my son bought this   a month ago and i had my doubts   he found at a used car dealer dye s in grantsville wv   when he took me for a test drive i said that it seem to shift hard auto   he said that i found some thing wrong with every car he found   the dealer said that the transmission had been rebuilt that transmissions were week and that they had put in a larger pump and it would last longer that way   my son asked him if transmission was warranted and yes it was   are state requires a   day    warranty   well the transmission slipped a few times and finally got worse   when my son asked him about it before the   days was up   the dealer said you probably should get a new trans   my son then went to the place that rebuilt the trans   they said some fluid leak was normal   they finally said would order a modulator valve and let him know   when a young college student works hard for their money this hurts more than you know   he checked the gas mileage without the air on and it got a dismal   miles to the gallon   it should be against the law for car dealers to make a vehicle that gets less than   miles to the gallon   summary don t buy a if your interested in fuel mileage getting a good transmission   talk to several people and see if they recommend dealer or not br br  
139,0,  my   is my first product in   years   my initial reaction to this vehicle   the quality of their products has remained the same or dropped in that time period vs   the expected improvement as a truck   my expectations were somewhat different vs   a passenger car   particularly in areas of ride and cab comfort   generally   i was pleasantly surprised in both areas   however   the overall quality level of the truck quickly eroded any positive feelings for the vehicle some of the quality problems were superficial or cosmetic    incorrectly cut carpeting   exposed wiring   radio knobs that have no start stop points   not show stoppers   but enough to leave you uneasy about things you don t see or use on a regular basis other quality issues were more problematic   the truck was delivered with loose front wheel bearings and was badly out of alignment    to the point of ruining the front tires within   miles due to cupping i have experienced   severe vibration in power steering assembly that it intermittent irregular idle and loss of power when clutch is disengaged air conditioning that fails to discharge evaporated water correctly   causing mildew in the evaporator box that must be flushed and deodorized on a regular basis   these are problems that i would expect to encounter at    miles   not at   miles as a daily driver   the truck is a mixed bag   gas mileage has been disappointing     in town    on highway vs    rating   the ride is better than expected    somewhat choppy   but acceptable for a truck   especially with a short wheelbase on the positive side   the standard bench seats are comfortable and come with a    split   legroom and headroom is adequate for a    person   the standard stereo system has a built in cd player and delivers better than average sound quality   the heater delivers more than adequate heat   but does suffer from a c odor problems   dash board control and gauges are easy to read and provide more than standard idiot lights   a tach would be helpful with standard transmission models   especially to monitor idle levels this truck initially caught my eye due to its sticker price   which seemed very reasonable   unfortunately   low price does not always mean value   and in this case   it didn t br br  
140,0,  i bought this vehicle because it is a sharp looking truck   there   i have said something positive about it   now   let s get to the real important info   the brakes on this truck are a joke   it has been in the shop   times for brake problems ranging from flat out brake loss to a leaky master cylinder to the brakes locking up and or failing in the rain   the stereo is excellent   however the speakers fail to deliver more than an annoying staticky rattle   the air conditioning won t allow you to adjust the temperature on max ac to anything but arctic   the power steering pump whines and moans   the power windows jump down in intervals instead of smoothly rolling down   the ride is stiff and bouncy   the transmission takes it sweet time going through the gears and sometimes missing one or two along the way whether or not i make it to the end of the lease in this vehicle remains to be seen   having paid almost   k for it a year ago and having it only worth    k in trade now with only    miles is disheartening   do yourself a favor buy something else br br  
141,0,  i have been the unfortunate victim of ownership   i know i have no one to blame but myself but the fact remains i have not one    but two vehicles that i wish i never laid eyes on    one of these products is a   which was purchased in september of    the is a small truck   cylinder to boot    so my expections in the power department was pre decided   i bought the truck to skiddle around town in    and haul a this and that from home depot so power is not something i expected although the very lack of power is something i never expected   i am lucky to hit   after   minutes and the transmission does lag more than quite a bit it whines and cries upon any boot to the gas pedal and never gets up to speed do nt even attempt a freeway or an upward grade    i believe you may roll backwards   the gas milage is worse than bad and the promised    is far from being true   in fact it is more like    if your lucky   with gas at    a gallon i consider this a killjoy on the pocketbook   but the worse part of this is the lack of response from or our dealership to do anything about the lack of power    not to mention the cosmetic problems    on wednesday of this week it wil be my seventh trip into the dealership to secure my inside roof   yes    you got it the interior roof is collapsing and no one wants to do a thing about it   and living in a desert area i ca nt seem to keep the plastic molding from warpage no matter how ard i try   but and their bumper to bumper warranty does nt mean a hill of beans if they refuse to act and honor that warranty as they did in my case   basically if there is nt a technician report sent out    then there is nt a problem   so since my transmission or interior does nt have a tech report released by those wonderful engineers at well i have to live with it and all the other rattles and hums this vehicle has   and in the mean time i feel stupider than stupid for giving anything but a good cussing   so avoid porducts unless you want to live the horrors of ownership like i have for the past year and a half   
142,0,  i bought my windstar for a few reasons    i have two active teenagers and a grandson   i wanted a vehicle that could also double as taxi for all of their friends    i love to travel by car and i thought that this vehicle would save me hotel motel fees    i love lyndsey wagner   lol first let me tell you   i have the   version of the windstar   i hate this van it s less comfortable than riding a greyhound bus cross country   it eats gas like you wouldn t believe     city and   highway   i ve taken it into the shop many times   and the dealer always claims that the problem is fixed only to have many more     problems   i ve replaced the brakes more times than i can count   and the windstar drinks up more oil than a sailor on leave forget windy conditions   the windstar bobs around like a ship lost at sea last but not least   the seats do not lay down to make a bed   they fold   so there s no way to camp out in the wind star the windstar reminds me of a nicely made bed with no sheets on it in other words   it looks pretty on the outside   but there is nothing under all that pretty lace br br  
143,0,  i own a   windstar that was purchased after we learned that we were expecting our second child   i spent hours reading consumer magazines and researching full size cars and mini vans   i pretty much knew that a mini van would be more up my alley so a larger car never had much of a chance   all that i had read about vans was that the windstar was what we were looking for but probably out of our price range   was i ever happy to read an ad in our local paper with a local dealer selling them at under     i must say that out of all the dealerships we went to while looking at various vans from different companies the dealership won hands down as far as good sales people   the salesman listened to what we wanted in a van and made sure that it s what we got   when we didn t qualify for all of the rebates that were being offered he still made sure the selling price was in our range and we got some decent financing terms   after   days of debating we went ahead and purchased the windstar after only having the van for a month or so was when our problems started   first it was a little thing   the windshield had come unsecured to the van and had to be re glued   after an all day stay at the service department we were on the road again   then after about   or   months of ownership we had a transmission leak   after another stay   this time overnight   we were reunited    months after ownership we had to have a rod replaced   things went relatively smooth for a while before we were back to the service dept   for mystery transmission problems and more noises coming from under the vehicle this time we needed to have a sensor in the transmission replaced   as for the mystery noises that turned out to be many things   we had another rod replaced   the steering column replaced   a cracked strut casing   and something else that escapes me at the moment holy cow   i don t drive at breakneck speeds nor to i beat on a vehicle   i have two children in the van most of the time so i can t afford to be reckless   now my van is acting up again with the transmission and the service dept   can t find a thing wrong with it   after a talk with the man that worked on my van i am no longer confident in products   he explained that the vehicle that was sold to me was originally designed for mail delivery and not highway use   so at highway speeds it is possible that the van just acts up because the transmission can t handle them   not a comforting thought also i was told by the service dept   that windstar s are known for having to have rods replaced why didn t anyone tell me that before now i have strange squeals coming form under the hood when i turn my a c on   i am   miles away from going on to my extended warranty plan and i am grateful i bought it   i fear that i would go broke if i had not   unfortunatly i am stuck with the van until it dies or my husband s car does   but i can tell you i look forward to the day when i can get a new van from another car manufacture br br  
144,0,  i am a proponent of domestic vehicles   i realize that many imports are reported to have better quality assurance   better final product   i have never felt that the inflated cost of north america s favorite imports could be justified   maybe now i do   my   windstar l has been a disappointment   i live in the country and commute daily to a large metropolitan area for work   it is a drive that could be considered   quot easy quot   as it is mostly highway driving on secondary roads at about   mph with not many stop and go s   because of my commute i put on about    miles a year   i currently have approximately    miles   i require a reliable   comfortable and relatively economical vehicle   surprisingly enough   the windstar i own averages about   mpg and i have had up to   mpg in ideal weather conditions   the fuel economy was a pleasant bonus   on the other hand my windstar has had many annoying small problems   during the warranty period   first    miles   i have had the following problems   a   check engine light on   sensor defect   b   mass air flow sensor   maf    when it goes you re dead in the water   improper air fuel mixture   it happened at    miles   c   door ajar sensor   this one needs to be talked about   the sensor went due to a short in the ground   interestingly enough   the rear wiper uses the same ground and as a result the rear wiper was fried   when this sensor goes    and it s over the weekend with no service dept   open   you have no alternative but to disconnect your battery as the dome light inside can not be manually turned off   and if you don t your battery will run down   by disconnecting the positive battery terminal   you reset the onboard monitoring computer which renders engine diags   impossible until the computer   quot relearns quot   your driving habits and can set baselines for diagnostics   maybe   and other manufacturers that have the same setup   should use a separate backup system battery like the lithium ion backup battery found in a personal computer   this sensor has gone twice   once due to a short in the ground   the other time for no apparent reason   it continues to sporadically go on and off while driving   d i have had occasional clunking in the front end   i brought the vehicle into the dealership and told them i suspected the transmission   it has occasionally had difficulty up down shifting at the gear cusp to overdrive about mph   they could find no obvious problem   but did find loose tie rods and replaced them   i am now past basic warranty and have the air bag sensor light staying on   seconds past when all other sensors have been initiated at startup   according to my manual   i need the air bag checked immediately   the feel of my vehicle is still not right   i have sporadic shuddering from either the transmission   the mass air flow sensor   or the tie rods   or the idle arms etc   etc   my decision comes down to maintaining a safe vehicle by dumping money into an obviously sub standard product   or getting rid of it and eating a large amount of negative equity   i have had the vehicle only   months   any way i look at it   keeping it may cost fortune   trading it will definitely cost a fortune   either way   i as the consumer have been shafted a colleague of mine has a   windstar and just had its transmission rebuilt     miles   it seems that continue to use a transmission with a known engineering flaw   an aluminium piston   i had a   sable wagon that had the piston go and the transmission was rebuilt with a steel piston as the replacement   why doesn t just re engineer the transmission   do a general recall and change the piston so what can i do   i have   children and need the flexibility of a minivan   i can t afford to change my vehicle every     years     quality is no longer job     epilogue   i buckled   bit the bullet   dumped the turkey   the vehicle above has been traded for a toyota corolla   big difference from a minivan   small for my family of five   but a great little car   maybe should pay out the negative equity that i just had to eat br br  
145,0,  the winstar may seem like to answer to all your family s needs   but beware   there can be some drawbacks to this vehicle that you ll want to consider    ps   i saved the worst problem for last why we bought a winstar after a lengthly search of all the auto market has to offer for a family of seven to ride in   we settled on the winstar   i have owned several vehicles in the past and felt like   quality was still job   quot   this this brand   i was torn between the modern looking taurus wagon and the winstar   although the taurus wagon with the fold away jumpseat in the back actually seats    we felt like the benefits of the split front driver passenger seat in the minivan would be better for taking care of kids riding behind you   what i hate about the winstar    inadequate air conditioning system problems began a few hours after we rolled off the showroom floor and the passengers in the back   especially in the third seat became hot and sweaty   we realized that the air conditioning system is totally inadequate for rear passengers   we live in texas   yes it get s hot here   however   any temperatures above   degrees and the folks in the back get hot and sweaty very quickly   i lost track of how many times i would arrive to the store or church and unload my poor soaking wet w sweat kids from the back   my baby drinks an extra bottle each time we go somewhere because he just gets so hot   if you get a winstar   pay extra and get the second a c system or you ll regret it    strangling seatbelts this has not happened to us before   but the winstar s seatbelts just don t seem to be satisfied with the hold they can have on you   they keep tightening up until your neck feels like it s being sawed off   or worse   you get a lovely seatbelt hickey to hide   i hate to say it   but i even found myself dressing in certain garments in order to protect my neck   i even bought short sleeved little turtlenecks in the summer   now   i keep a soft towel handy to tuck against my neck to alleviate   i am     feet tall so this is not a short person problem for me   however   if you aren t that tall   watch your neck    power steering problems the hoses for the power steering leak and seem to be prone to developing this   wouldn t you know that you can only get the hoses from and they are expensive too   i have been having to add power steering fluid to the winstar about twice a week or it makes a horrible grinding noise that makes nearby neighbors and pedestrians stop and stare as we drive by get ear muffs for the neighbors unless you like   being noticed   alot    flying hubcaps this is weird   but the hubcaps just don t like to stay on this car   okay   you probably think i am a lousy driver   but after twenty years of driving   i have never had to replace so many   of course the hubcaps are     each   forget that   good luck trying to by nice wheels for it   i found out the front wheel drive rims for this baby are a fortune    get on with wheels    the very worst thing about the winstar this is the pathetic part   with this many problems   i wanted to trade my winstar in for something else   i found out that after buying the vehicle   months previously and taking very good care of it   the winstar i paid      for was now worth a trade in of    only   short months and    miles later   i couldn t believe it i was so upset   i had to stomp out of several dealerships before i realized that this vehicle loses practically half it s value when you roll off the showroom floor   no one can justify that to me folks what i love about it i still maintain that the design of the minivan is an excellent one for transporting people of all ages comfortably   the design of the winstar is very functional   if you like the design   then may i suggest the caravan   both minivans are of a similar design   however   the new caravans are more streamlined   cool the inside better   and the seatbelts are friendly   my mom got a caravan and i am jealous   it is a pleasure to drive the winstar   i like being able to see what s going on in the traffic ahead of me   i will confess   when i drove my mom s caravan   it did handle better and the back seat can actually switch places with the middle bench seat and give you more options   the winstar does not allow you to switch the places of the seats   only to fold them down or take them out completely i have considered myself a person up until now   i think i am going to go next time around   that is whenever i finally get out from under my winstar s ridiculous trade in situation take care   happy motoring love your margarine br br  
146,0,  let me start off by saying that when i leased my   windstar it was in july of    i leased it because it was rated number one in overall safety for mini vans that year i leased it for two years and when the lease was up my wife loved it so much that i purchased the vehicle for her   this vehicle is now   years old and has about a little over    miles on it when i leased this vehicle i thought it was covered by a five year     mile warranty   i was wrong it is only covered by a   year     mile warranty   after three years of driving this vehicle without ever having a problem the electric door locks started to malfunction   first the driver side would not lock then it would not open   then the side sliding door had the same trouble   when i finally got a day off of work i took it to my local dealer island on staten island ny   this is not the dealer i leased the vehicle from   and asked for the locks to be repaired   this is when i found out that my warranty had expired   days earlier   they told me they would not fix the locks unless i paid for them     i was later lead to believe that it was because i did not purchase the vehicle from them or they would have taken care of the problem   i came home and called   they said they would contact the dealer to see if this could be worked out and i should hear from island in    days   a week later i contacted again to let them know i haven t heard from the dealer   they said they did the service manager refused to fix the vehicle   after days of haggling with and trying to go up the chain of command i finally get some guy who tells me my decision is final and nobody can change it   i wrote a e mail to mr   nasser the ceo of and kept getting answers from different people but i could never get to him directly their customer service is terrible now this vehicle has locks that don t work because i didn t get there   days earlier and with only    miles on it   it sounds like the power steering pump is going   this vehicle is going up for sale as soon as the winter is over and that will end my relationship with forever what s your opinion   i d like to know    
147,0,  i feel compelled to write this so noone else buys a windstar   maybe these vehicles are reliable for the first few years but then they go bad very quickly   i suppose the winstar would work well as a leased vehicle   any longer than    years and you re in for trouble i purchased a   windstar and unless they ve made huge changes i can t imagine the new ones being much better   we know a engineer we live in michigan   and she say s really cheapens out the windstar parts   everything is taken down to the bare minimum for nearly every important part   the windstar is a big money maker for during the   years of windstar ownership i went through    strut replacement    transmission rebuilt   times thank god for aamco and lifetime warranty    head gasket blowout    weird clonk noise in front when going over bump very loud and nobody could find out what it was    right side door lock made loud   craaaaank   noise when locked   never fixed    replaced starter    gas tank gasket seal broke and interior smelled like gas    serpentine belt   tensioner pully   broke twice    back end continually rattled while driving   never fixed    muffler had an o sensor   socket   blow out   had to have the threaded nut welded back into the muffler    power steering   creeked   and was hard to turn   never fixed    first   days of ownership the vehicle was in the shop for transmission issues nearly   days    the back plastic hatch handle inside   broke off several times    tiny hub caps were replaced several times obviously i m no longer a winstar fan   in fact i regard it as the worst money i ve ever spent in my whole life   the firestone repairman constantly said the windstar and the taurus were the   worst vehicles on the road   during the past   years we never felt comfortable taking the windstar on a long trip   the last trip was   months ago through virginia and we swore the transmission was slipping   when we got back home the aamco guy rebuilt the transmission for the rd time needless to say i m done buying and have moved to the honda s   this is the second vehicle to let me down   the first was the older granada but that s another story dave
148,0,  this van was in the shop   times in the first   months that i owned it the engine would stall and then it would not restart   this happened once to me on the highway doing   kph    mph   very very scary first the dealer told me that there was nothing wrong with it   the second time they claimed it was the o sensor   the third time they said it was the computer and they reprogrammed it   the fourth time they replaced the computer   the fifth time they replaced the throttle body and it finally seemed to cure the stalling all of this was done under warranty   but it was extremely inconvenient   in addition   i lost all confidence in the vehicle and ended up driving it in the slow lane   etc   in case it stalled out again   refused to replace the vehicle the van has also had   tie rods replaced on separate occasions as well   this is on a vehicle with less than    kms      miles   on it   it was also in the shop to fix the cruise control as well   finally   i was stranded again with an under the hood fuel leak other highs and lows rear seat removal is easy   but the seat is very heavy   definitely a two person operation   the rear seat moves forward about   inches   which adds a bit of extra luggage space   it folds down as well   which is useful   because removing the seat is such a pain the factory roof rack is flimsy   with a very low load capacity i have the rear air option   we only use it to cool the van down after it has been sitting in the summer sun   otherwise it can be almost too powerful   in the winter   there is no rear temperature control    we usually turn off the rear heat because it gets too hot we never use the tilting driver s seat for access to the rear seats   to allow for this feature   the driver s door is extra long   which makes it awkward in parking lots front seats and the optional mid row captains chairs are comfortable   but i find the rear seat too hard and flat the engine has lots of low end torque   but runs out of steam as revs rise   the transmission is fine on upshifts   but can be hard on downshifts   the transmission is geared for relaxed cruising   engine revs at   mph are around   rpm   this makes for a relaxed ride   but ensures the need for a noisy downshift when passing the sliding side door rolls more smoothly and is easier for kids to close than some other mini van doors sound insulation and ride is okay   there is an optional kiddie convex shaped mirror   which really helps to keep track on what the kids are doing in the back there is an optional control for the radio for the rear passengers   which can be good or bad depending upon what your kids like to listen to i also got the optional center console   which has a handy power outlet   the console adds lots of storage space   but makes access to the rear seats from the interior a little difficult   the power outlet in the console is always on   even when the key is out of the ignition   which is handy   i also got the optional power outlet for the center row seats   which is useful for the kids there is a door lock switch in the back hatch area which is handy the bolt cover for the optional alloy wheels is huge   it covers    of the wheel   which is ridiculous   considering that i spent the extra    for the alloy   not for plastic  
149,0,  i bought my   windstar used in april of    i thought i was making a sound choice   i did all of the research   poured over articles   ran a carfax report   and took it to a mechanic   little did i know   my van has given me nothing but problems   i hadn t had my van for   days when i had to take it back to the dealer to get a transmission leak fixed all of the fluid was gone   i then had to replace my serpentine belt which still squeeks   then   months later my snap ring sensor on my abs broke   i had to get my camshaft synchronizer replaced    not covered under my warranty   and no mechanic would touch it   i had numerous small problems with it that were covered under warranty   but cost me     every time i had to have them fixed   i finally thought i was all done with the major repairs then came the brake problems   we had   brake jobs done in   months only to realize that the hydrolic control unit on my front drivers side brake wasn t working surprise   surprise this was not covered under my extended warranty either      not to mention my roof rack leaks so that every time it rains my seatbelts become soaked   then my passenger side automatic window stopped working and my rear drivers side window only works half the time   i have sunk more money into this van   than any other car i have owned   i m shopping for a new vehicle now because i only have    miles left on my extended warranty and there is a knocking under the hood that we can t identify and it pulls unmercifully to the right   i ve had it alligned and had the tow checked   the only good thing i can say is that my dealerships repair shop and used car manager have bent over backwards trying to appease me   maybe i just bought a lemon   but i will definately think twice before buying another windstar  
150,0,  the vehical i own is presently out of commision so my parents are letting me use thier   windstar   i am very greatful for them loaning it to me but   what a lemon   the inside light and dinger does not go off unless you are going   mph or faster and if you get below that speed limit   the interior light comes on and the ding ding ding chirps as loud as can be   i ve taken it in to be looked at more than once and the dealership always gives the van back saying   quot the problem is fixed quot   maybe i should be gripping about the manufacturer but that s not the only problem   the ride is really smooth as long as you drive   mph or more   the seats don t lay down   they fold   which makes it impossible to use for camping   i would have never puchased this automobile   i wish they would hurry and fix my car     
151,0,  i purchased a   windstar in spring of   and now have    miles on it   i did not get a after having put a transmission in our last one    so did everyone else i knew   i liked the extra room however we have had many minor problems   for one thing the wheels can not be balanced    new sets of tires   several balances   trip to dealer under warranty did not help   currently the brake light is always on   they cruise control quit working   the seat panel fell off   and the rear heat operation is sporadic   i still have my   van and it drives smoother than the windstar   next time i will return to and just plan on putting in a new transmission at    miles     
152,0,  while our instincts told us not to buy this vehicle   we did anyway   we bought our windstar and sold it   months later   i believe makes a good product   but this in my opinion is not   our windstar rattled   and just felt cheap   having drove a jeep suv before the windstar i missed sitting up high   and didn t feel as safe in the windstar   it was easy to move around   but had no sportiness or fun when driving   i have driven other minivans that i felt were of a much higher quality than the windstar   the carpet stained easily and was hard to clean   just not a good buy in my opinion   dawn   
153,0,  i bought my   cobra in january    i missed the power after selling my modified   gt a couple of years ago   my cobra had    miles on it   so   it was practically new   i was impressed with the power of the cobra and the brakes   however   i had problems with my cobra   there was what some call   driveline slop   when shifting   there would always be a loud clunking noise coming from the rear of the car   eventually   there was a big   bang   one day and it turns out my rear differential failed   there were problems with the warranty repair but that s another story   see note at end   after getting the car back it drove better    driveline slop   was gone   i was happy until a month later   when the rear axle bearings went out and needed to be towed back home   the car has left me stranded twice and it only now has    miles on it   the axle was repaired under warranty and now i will sell the car as soon as possible   i will not keep this car past the warranty period there are other things i should mention like the drivers s seat shifting during some cornering and the front bumper is loose   you can move it up and down with your hands   the dealership says this is   normal   i don t think so the overall quality of the interior is kind of cheap looking with lot s of plastic   the shifter console is loose around the shifter   just overall low quality   looks like just built a piece of crap car around a good engine and brakes   note to anyone considering buying a used car from a dealership   if the car is still under mfgr s warranty   have the dealership print you out a copy of the vehicle s   oasis   report   that s the vehicle info database   it shows all repairs done at dealerships and it shows the vehicles warranty status   this could become important later  
154,0,  i bought my explorer because of the way it drove   looked and performed   last week i would have given the explorer an a   review   however coming home from work last week   i experienced the fear of a lifetime   i always use my cruise control   and never doubted that when i put my foot on the brake   the cruise control would disengage   this was not the case last week   instead   it went faster   i got off the interstate   going about   miles an hour   i was relieved to be heading for a field   where i could not hurt anyone else   i tried to disengage the cruise control on the panel   with no success   as i neared the field i noticed that there was a rocky culvert and a barb wire fence surrounding it   making it impossible to get to the open field having slowed the car down to   with the emergency brake   i was forced to throw the explorer into park   when my knees stopped shaking   i got out of the car and noticed that the tires were smoking   a man on a tracker came by and called for help when my friend arrived   he got in and the brakes worked fine   this leads me to believe that it is a defect in the cruise control now my   check engine   light is on and the car does not idle   i have to push down on the excelerator   just to get my car to move   my tires are dangerous to drive on hopefully motors will take care of the damage it caused   but i am not sure they will   as the car now has    miles on it and no longer under warranty   has anyone had this problem occur to their explorer   whether under warranty or not   i think they should take this episode very seriously     
155,0,  we bought a new explorer in   and felt we got a pretty good deal after beating on a couple of fleet sales managers   some of the reasons we purchased the limited are   we liked the leather option for the seats   the privacy glass for all but the driver and passenger windows    i really liked   the interior door lock by the back interior door   the ability to lower the back seats and move the front seats all the way forward to accommodate my     frame if i wanted to sleep inside the vehicle   it was not as tall as most all of the other suv s so it would fit in our not so tall garage   the shift on the fly four wheel drive option   and the classic lines that didn t look like a gm product   now mind you i have had a couple of other products and had the same problem with at least   of them   the transmission we never thought that there would be the same problem with the explorer   but at k miles guess what   after coming to a full stop the transmission locked up and it wasn t going to go anywhere   fortunately the warranty covered the replacement and we were off to see the sights of oregon   since then the only problem we have encountered has been the automatic shock adjustment for different types of roads   they have not evenly leveled the vehicle and it is plain to see when you stand behind and look at it   it doesn t seem to affect the ride but we don t know what would be an obvious sign that it needed repaired other than just looking at it   one other real down side to the vehicle is the ride   on long trips the lumbar support just isn t there and driving can become painful br br  
156,0,  we bought an eddie bauer explorer in    we bought the car with a tow package and routinely used it to tow a popup camper   we loved the interior of the car and the way the car looked in the winter of    the car had    miles   we were moving to the bay area for   months and had rented a small u haul   my husband was driving the car out to california   when in the middle of nebraska   the transmission gave out   a dealer came out tow the car into the dealership   his comments to my husband   quot didn t you know you can not tow with a quot   we had to totally replace the transmission on this car   all attempts to contact to help with the payment were met with denial   we even federal expressed a letter to the president of about this issue    months later we received a form letter we have found out since then has awful issues with their transmissions   check out all the web sites about this   we sold the car immediately and have since owned a mercedes m class   great drive and great tow   and a suburban    wonderful do not waste your money on this car   it will fall apart on you and will not care br br  
157,0,  after reading the positive reviews posted on epinion   i thought i would share my negative experience with consumers   it seems the focus is a hit or miss model   the cars built right run fine   but those that miss the mark are unreliable and a hazard on the road we bought a new focus three months ago   june   in las vegas   the research   albeit a limited internet search   told of a car which was inexpensive   safe   well built and sporty   one week after we bought the focus   the car died on a busy freeway   it was repaired and returned in two days   trusting the reliability of a new car   we drove from nevada to tucson   where it died again on a stretch of road called properly termed   dead man s highway   in the middle of summer   anyway   this type of incident occurred twice more since we ve owned the focus   and considering the car has been in the shop for almost half that time doesn t bode well for reliabilty   fuel pump problems seem to be our burden   but other focus owners have different   but equally disappointing problems with their vehicles   something common to all focuses though are brake problems   car rental companies with focuses on their lot are told to replace brake pads at      miles because pads fail like clockwork   car owners   unfortunately   are only given a warranty on brakes for   years or    miles   so replacement pads are an out of pocket expense   a repeated problem continually found on focus complaint records are brakes that squeal and grind   the problem can not be fixed   and denies there are any design flaws   a website dedicated to filing a class action lawsuit against   fordfocusbreakproblems   might be of further help   also   read the negative reviews found on carsmart   i believe my idea of a   hit or miss   car will be clear from the reviews posted on that site   for those who love your focus   i am jealous   i wish i could spend my weekends some place other then service centers   for those who are looking to buy   do the research   please heed my warning and don t risk your time and money into a focus  
158,0,  the aerostar minivan is one of the worst minivans ever made it s not dependable   it constantly needs repairs   and is not something you want to stare at   the only good thing about it is it s engine selection you can choose between a   cylinder   a    v or a    v   i have a    version   when it s working it has good acceleration and horsepower   it has seating for seven and a large cargo area   it doesn t get good mileage and it gets pushed around by the wind it burns up master cylinders and transmissions   i personally would like to set mine on fire because it is not running well   my aerostar s air conditioning hasn t worked in two years   over all this van is not a very good vehicle br br  
159,0,  while the taurus is a comfortable   and rather inexpensive car   it won t get high ratings from our family   true to form   this car has lived up to the reputation of   quot fix or repair daily quot   bought used after our beloved jetta was totaled in an accident   this car seemed promising at the start   the front seats are plush and comfortable   the back seat is roomy enough for children   fits two car seats easily   but the middle seat is hard and uncomfortable   an arm rest can be brought down in the middle   and there s even a lap shoulder belt for the middle seat   but it feels like you re sitting on a rock hard surface   the back seats also folds down to expand the trunk room for hauling larger items the trunk itself is fairy large   not quite comparable to the roominess of a vw jetta s trunk   but still plenty of room for playpens or groceries   the air conditioner and heater work well   but sometimes seem slow to kick in   the stereo system is an iffy item   on one hand   it has decent sound   and provides enough bass to make most music palatable   while on the other hand it is part of the console and pretty much irreplaceable   i wouldn t advise buying this car if you re the type to pop stereo systems in and out however nice the amenities seemed at first   we started having problems with it   it features a faulty transmission that s always begging for repair   slipping in and out of gear   if you use any brake pads other than the ones   they squeal   squeak   and squawk within a thousand miles   the disc pads do not just go in with a c clamp either   you have to buy a special tool that looks like a little block   this makes a simple job a pain to complete overall   while the taurus may be inexpensive   fairly comfortable   and feature decent power   it is no fun to constantly be repairing something or trying to figure out just what is squeaking this time   this taurus needs to be put out to pasture br br  
160,0,  we purchased a new taurus in    in the first   year we owned the car it was to the dealer several times for minor repairs   the speedometer malfunctioned and had to be replaced and the alternator went out the major problems began after the car was out of warranty and had close to    miles on it the rear engine mounts were the first to go with repair costs being close to      then once again the speedometer had to be replaced at a cost of approx       over thanksgiving weekend   the fan that cools the went out it was taken to the dealer for repairs at a cost of     when the car was returned to us with the new fan we noticed our heater was no longer working   it was taken back to the dealer and low and behold it had a blown head gasket     the car is once again returned to us   the very first time i drive it the check engine light comes on and i smell radiator fluid   the car goes back to the dealer and this time has a split radiator with the cost being      i am almost scared to drive it now   i really like this car due to the fact that it has a great safety rating and it is a very comfortable car to drive and ride in   however i would recommend that you trade it in before it goes out of warranty br br  
161,0,  the taurus i am driving is a car assigned to me a little over   year ago   the following information should be useful for someone who is considering purchasing one as a used car exterior    my white taurus looks like an albino sperm whale   the rounded windshield   rounded rear window   bug eyed headlights   and the smiling mouth grill opening combine to make this a cartoon of a car interior    the interior appears to be well thought out with one exception   the terrible ergonomics of the front seats   there is no lumbar support or side support   i ve developed chronic aches in my shoulders from leaning on the fold down center console and the inside of the driver door   i am    quot   and weigh   lbs   perhaps the seats were designed for much wider drivers   three of my colleague   of various girth   who also drive the taurus complained the same of the gl s base seats   other than the seats   the rest interior is very roomy and quiet at any speed   headroom and legroom are plentiful   the dash is made of high grade plastic and rattle free even after    miles   the trunk will swallow just about anything even plywood with the rear seats folded down   the lift over height may be low   but the wide tail lamps reduced the trunk width engine    the    liter v accelerates very nicely and provides excellent fuel economy for a full size car nearly mpg freeway handling    sometimes forgetting that this is not a sports car   i would take some curves too fast   the taurus is very forgiving   however   in response with some body roll and tire squeals   very good handling for an american sedan reliability    my purchased about   of these vehicles and reliability has become an issue   one taurus   definitely a lemon   was in the shop   times within a one year period for the same problem   the engine would just quit while cruising on the freeway   the dealership replaced several electrical components before the problem went away   at approximately    miles most of these cars began experiencing transmission   quot slips or lurches quot   we spent    on one of these   just last week   the mass air flow sensor   some component for emissions control and engine regulation   went out on mine   the part itself costs    value    the depreciation on the taurus is horrendous   from     to    in four years the verdict   a very good car when new with upgraded seats don t purchase this as a used vehicle unless you are a mechanic or have a mechanic buddy     
162,0,  my two year old taurus has been in for service ten times for the same steering and alignment problem   each time   the service manager says    quot it s fixed quot   as they always replace some suspension component   but   it s never fixed   in fact   it keeps getting worse   they will not provide a loaner   even though it s under warranty and has been out of service at the dealer for over   days now i like the car   based on its styling   size   features   etc   but now my wife will no longer drive it   it s just too difficult to keep it going straight   you have to exert a considerable amount of effort to the steering wheel to stop the pulling which gets worse the faster the car is going now the service manager say    quot we don t want to put any more money into your car   so we ll give you    off a new one to trade out of your car quot   but   they offered me    to    for my car that had a sticker of     only   years ago   that s another way gets to make money on you   they try to shift their problem to you even though you have a warranty   and they believe you should pay them for their incompetence   and total disrespect for their customers what i think   they would then sell this car on their used car lot for an additional profit   of course   and cause another customer to suffer with it like we did   if they could fix it before putting it on the used car lot   why wouldn t they fix it for me   answer   they can t and they don t care who they hurt as long as they make money at the customer s expense my advice   makes nice   interesting cars   but when they make a bad one   they don t care   the customer assistance center   cac   says you have to take these issues up with the dealer   i told them my warranty is from   they do not care   so beware of buying a   the warranty means nothing to them   they do not care     
163,0,  i purchased a   taurus program car with    miles on it   from day    i have regretted that decision and will until i am rid of this lemon   i use my vehicles heavily and in the last year and a half   i have put    miles on it   i maintain my vehicles well   but for this car   it didn t matter   in     years   i have replaced the entire front end assembly three     times   replaced the transmission   and replaced the cam sensor due to hard starting   none of these repairs have fixed any of the problems with this p o s   i have written several letters to to express my deep displeasure and concern with an inferior product and to my dismay   no responses were ever given   it is easy to see that is perfectly happy to create an inferior product to sell to the u s   public no way would i ever recommend to anyone a taurus   i have a   and have driven a    the only good quality this vehicle has is that the ride is very smooth   although the front end assembly clunks when you hit the slightest of bumps br br  
164,0,  this car is okay   but not at all what i had anticipated   i would classify it on the smaller end of mid size car   at least in the passenger seating area   maybe because mine is a wagon they moved everything up to make the wagon end bigger   i don t know   but to fit   people in is very cramped also   it is a v but lacks any ooomph in its acceleration   we bought this   vehicle in   with k miles and it only has k miles now but it already has problems starting on occasion   on the upside   i think it is a decent looking car for being a wagon and the rear seats fold down for more carrying area when needed   mine has the third seat in back too which will come in handy down the road   for a smallish person like myself   the car is actually perfect    i get lost in a mig car anyway   it is just not the perfect family size vehicle we thought a stationwagon would be br br  
165,0,  it amazes me to go through all the internet resources and realize what a wide spread problem the has with head gaskets   i have always liked my taurus yet at   miles it is falling apart   since february   it has been in the shop   times   my warranty doesn t cover head gasket repair   which is what my independent mechanic says is wrong with it   will not take the word of an independent mechanic only a mechanic   first they said it was the overflow tank which i had replace in march due to rusty   leaking water now in may i have rusty   leaking water again   the dealership says its not a head gasket    now it s the freeze plug and i need a bypass kit   anyway i am frustrated and i would like to hear anything related to the   taurus   i can sympathize   by the way my car has been very well maintained and loved   please send any information or horror stories to ckn aol thanks     
166,0,  i bought my   taurus at a dealership in powhatan virginia because i loved the way it handled and the way it looked   in addition i spoke with other taurus owners   and was told that you couldn t beat the taurus   liter engine for dependability   i was a happy owner for the first   years   then one day   my wife was driving the taurus with my   children buckled in the back seat   when the engine overheated badly   she found a place to pull over   as the steam came pouring out from the cracks under the hood   she called me   and i had the car towed to the nearest service station that evening   the problem was that a freeze plug had corroded so badly   it finally gave way the mechanic informed me that there was also a lot of rust in the cooling system   he replaced the freeze plug   and flushed the cooling system   about   months later   i had the same problem   rusty water pouring out of a badly corroded freeze plug   i took the car to my regular mechanic   and he informed me that there was a recall on my taurus for which i was never notified   the reason i was given for the recall was that had manufactured the   taurus   liter engine and installed it in the vehicle without treating the inside of the block with a rust inhibitor i had the vehicle towed to the nearest dealer   and they reimbursed me for the freeze plug that i had had replaced at the service station   treated the block and replaced the most recently corroded freeze plug the very next day   on my way to work   coolant came pouring out of the block and the car overheated for the third time   the dealer had the vehicle towed back to the shop and replaced the remainder of the freeze plugs   over the course of the next   years   i had the vehicle back to the dealership   times complaining that my temperature guage was going up   almost to the red   when i was idling and would go back down when i was crusing   each time the service manager informed me that he could not duplicate the problem   the taurus now has    miles on it   for the past few weeks   i had noticed that it had a slow coolant leak   i took it back to the dealership   days ago   yesterday the service manager called to say that he needed to pull off the power steering pump and the alternator to find the source of the leak   after doing that   he called to say a freeze plug had to be replaced once again   and that would not be paying the bill because my warranty was expired   i agreed to pay   at a reduced labor rate   for the repair   after replacing the freeze plug   he called to inform me that it was still leaking   he said that it was his opinion that i should replace the engine rather than sink any more money into the rusted one   he said he would try to get the factory rep to pay for all but    of the repair but that i should call the     customer service line i called them and spoke with a lady there who informed me that would have paid for the engine up to    miles   but that since i had    miles on my vehicle   that would not pay anything   it was my contention   that since i have it documented at the dealership that i was having coolant problems all along that i was not out of warranty at all it is also my contention that my   taurus was doomed the day they manufactured the engine without treating the block with a rust inhibitor had to know that the   taurus would experience catastrophic problems before    miles   i will never purchase another product again   and i suggest that anyone reading this follow suit     
167,0,  here s everything i have nice to say about this car i purchased my   thunderbird from a seattle car dealership   months ago   it was in impeccable condition and had    miles on it   the previous owners were a retired couple who had kept the car garaged the entire time they had it   they elected to trade it in because they wanted a full size buick   purchase price for this vehicle was     and the original sticker price for this v equipped version was     i would have never anticipated buying a thunderbird this old   but the low mileage and condition of the car were what sold me   compared to the   el camino i d been driving   this car was pure nirvana to drive one thing i like about the car is its smooth ride   the suspension is not so soft that you feel detached from the road   but far more comfortable than a subcompact like my escort   a great little econobox   by the way   but that s a future epinion fit and finish of the car is above average   seats are comfortable without being overly soft   leg room is ample in front   but in back is only adequate my car has cloth seats   leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter   power driver s seat adjustment   power mirrors   overdrive   cruise control and for speaker jbl factory stereo with cassette   sound system is ok   and now that everyone has cd s   the system is a candidate for upgrading now for the bad news    buyer beware at approximately    miles the engine suffered catastrophic head gasket failure and completely toasted the engine   the engine had to be replaced to the tune of    but in my case the bulk of this was covered by the extended warranty i purchased    s reconditioned engines address this head gasket problem   the    t birds did have a   customer care   notification on record   not exactly a recall   but something just short of that   because of the problem they were having with blown head gaskets   unfortunately   this notification is no longer valid on    t birds my advice    stay away from this car due to this head gasket problem  
168,0,  let me start by saying the first time i laid eyes on this car i fell in love with it   the exterior styling was sharp yet not outlandish   the interior was   in my opinion absolutely perfect   i could not imagine the controls being any easier to reach or more intuitive to operate   i especially drooled over the automatic climate controls    why do more cars not have this feature   even the shifter knob seemed to fit right into my hand   though at the time i could not afford it new   i test drove it   the v version   and loved the way it picked up and handled   i wanted wanted wanted this car   a couple years later i totaled the car i did own in a huge snow caused multi car pileup   i needed a replacement immediately   to my great joy i found a    t bird used with only k for almost half of the new price   it was the v and the color was terrible   but it still seemed like a divine gift of fate   i loved the car for the first couple years i had it   not a single notable problem   until in   with almost k on it   the head gasket blew   just like the previous review mentioned   it was covered under an extended   pseudo recall   plan because it was such a common problem in the v models   to s credit   the was replaced completely with no cost to me   and   with a little coaxing   they actually gave me a loaner to drive for the entire time it took to get the there and installed   several weeks   at the time i chalked it up to a bad engineering flaw which they atoned for at their expense   until   months later   the transmission died   i was kinda tight on money at the time   and rather than dropping almost   grand to have it completely rebuilt   i opted to replace it with a used one   i realize the risk i took   but i figured it was the best i could do   and took my chances   then   in    that transmission died on me   i much considered dropping the car right then   but i had just paid it off a couple months before and in spite of my better judgement   a part of me still loved that car   a few months passed   and other minor problems popped up   which i attributed to age   including a brake cylinder blow out which luckily happened at parking lot speed and was fixed rather cheaply   and less notably a bushing in the front steering assembly that rotted away due to winter driving and some hard braking on my part   it also started making some noise due to a bad catalytic converter and some undiagnosed squeaky rattle coming from somewhere in the front brakes   the death blow was dealt by yet another problem with either the head gasket at close to k on the new   i thought this problem had been remedied at the time it was replaced   guess i was wrong   or possibly intake gaskets in that vicinity   at this point i have surrendered   the maintenance nightmare has worn away even the most optimistic and forgiving parts of my deep desire to love this monsterous piece of metal   in summary   i did manage to get almost k miles out of the car   though i probably sank more money into it than any logical person would   the times when it was running problem free it was a dream to drive   and i still hold to the belief that much of the car is of the highest design and ergonomic caliber   but the incidence of major mechanical problems with the most essential   and expensive   parts of the car are absolutely unforgivable   i have not heard any of these complaints with the v version   only with the   l v   if you have one of these   and you have not yet had problems   not likely   years after production   then please do what you can to either get rid of the car or get it serviced before it self destructs   i really wish that cues could be taken from the interior of this car   and many of the excellent intuitive features and transferred to other vehicles   but as much as i once loved this car   i can not recommend anyone to do anything but avoid it like the plague  
169,0,  i am in a construction business that forces me to move from one area to another as projects end   with a new project assignment comes a new vehicle   this time it s a     a step down from my previous explorer   needless to say   i was not happy for this downgraded vehicle at first especially with the stripped down absolute base model   but   it s free   so i don t complain i must confess that i am not a truck person   so i probably would never buy one with my own money   i have ridden a f   that is much nicer than a   but i would still prefer a car or an suv over a pickup truck   i understand that some people are just the opposite we are all different   another fact is that it is difficult to like a cheap vehicle once you have gotten used to a more expensive one   liking a particular vehicle is therefore all   quot relative quot   to what you have been used to   if you are stepping up to a from that   vw bug   you will love the improvements such as acceleration   quietness   etc   however   if you have been driving a   vw bug   this is a giant stepping down for its sluggish acceleration   noisy interior   and sheer ugliness   there   you get the picture of relativity the i drive has no optional equipment other than its   speed automatic transmission   it even come with manual window cranks that i thought have long gone away from automotive industry   a pickup truck is good for carrying stuff from hardware stores to my new home   it s just convenient to throw things in the back and go as long as it s not raining   if it rains   there s not enough room to put anything inside the cab   and for the obvious reasons   it s not convenient to shop from store to store as your purchases are exposed to open area unprotected   my came with a standard vinyl bench seat   and this is definitely a back killer for longer drives   in another words   it is very uncomfortable to drive more than   minutes or so   for me   a seat comfort is the number one importance more than any others   the   cylinder engine gets less than   mpg for combined city and highway driving making you to think it has good performance   however   its acceleration is   by today s standard   very poor   also   my accelerator pedal sticks in the morning   so pressing it harder makes it   quot jump quot   initially   this problem goes away after the engine warms up   while driving it is fairly easy   handling is not   making a turn requires a gentle touch   needing to come to almost a complete stop forward visibility is good because its higher sitting position   but i was quite surprised to find out how difficult it was to check my blind spots   it definitely has rear spots that are harder to check again   i drive it because it s free   not because i like it   if you are a   quot truck quot   person   then this could be a no non sense worry free vehicle   then again   if you are used to a pick up like f    just forget about getting a as you will be dreadful   where is your reference point br br  
170,0,  i have a   taurus   l axode in silver grey   this car is excellent for a family of four   and has plenty of leg room   and for a   a well designed ageless feel to it   the car has   km   it was the first attempt by to use dr   deming s japanese quality theory   it s still going   however i do use rust check spray every other year to stop salt damage in the canadian winter   the car handles very well   is low and wide and i never feel unsafe driving   the car still has original alternator   steering   radiator   fuel system   engine computer   emission control   convertor   front shocks   engine   wiper   master cylinder   fuel pump tank   i had to replace the transmission   below   starter   failed relay   brake booster   front bearing   front cv   right   muffler   tie rods   inner and outer   front bearings   water pump     plugs   wires   cap rotor   battery   a c clutch   a c seals   apart from the transmission   i consider this all normal wear and tear now the a c has failed   last year there was a musty odour   and perhaps the evaporator has failed   regardless it will cost    to fix and is simply not worth it at this age   a c must be the most unreliable part of any car   transmission failure    avoid cars with the   l engine   gasket failure   and all cars from   onwards   they suffer from weak transmissions   clutch failure and lube tubes   all taurus sable and windstar are prone to expensive repairs   i have had to replace the transmission at km and    years   attitude is unacceptable even though they extended the warranty   i should have been a total recall   once the warranty is over   are not interested in further compensation     all being said   however for a second hand vehicle    i paid   and i ve owned it    years   i think i have had overall value for money but i do not like the shoddy transmission if you own a   expect niggling problems   and possible major component failures   i suggest you invest in a web based extended warranty and buy a    year old product   at least you still have service life out of the car   and did not pay much for a decent family car   check out the web carefully for upcoming class actions and general comments on this car it also helps if you are a bit of a do it yourselfer and are able to figure out what might be the problem   before you go to your chosen independant local mechanic br br  
171,0,  from experience   i would have to say that this car is not worth the money you would spend on it   this was my first car and it had eighty thousand miles on it   it is a six cylinder     liter   from the start   i have had problems with my breaks   causing me to have them replaced four times in two years   one time my break pads actually fell out about three months after i had them fixed other problems that reoccured with my taurus is the transmission and mounts   i had to replace my transmission two time in eight months   the same with my mounts   when i finally got rid of my car   the transmission was dying again and it has only been seven months since the last time it broke   my mounts have cracked open twice   both time when i was driving   my alternator died twice   again when i was driving   at the time that i got rid of my car   the alignment was getting unaligned for no reason   i would be driving and it would get worse and worse i know another person who had a   taurus gl and she has had the same problems   i heard of a recall for a certain part of the car and went to check it out and i found that there are many parts on recall for this car i do have to say that this car does hold up well in an accident   though   i hit a car from behind and i was going about   m p h and all i really had to replace was the radiator   my air bag did not go out but that might have been because of the angle i hit the car at   neither my passenger or i was hurt at all   despite being thrown forward i like the interior of the car because it was very roomy and i could fit many people in there   the trunk is spacious and the only downfall to that is things can get lost easily in there   there was a dead spot in the steering wheel of about an inch in each direction   when my brakes did work   the anti lock system proved to be very effective   this car is affected by the wind a lot though   perhaps not as much as a smaller car   but more than i would like a car of that size to   my rear view mirror has fallen off about four times one summer but that was the only summer that it did that   that is an easy fix though   my cup holder would stick a lot also   it was the type that would just push right into the dashboard   the change holder was very conveniently placed   right under the radio     
172,0,  i have owned a   taurus since    in that time   i have sunk nearly    worth of repairs into it   including a transmission replacement   numerous brake jobs   and uncounted miscellaneous electrical and alignment based repairs   in its favor   it still runs after    miles   the air conditioning still works   however   nearly everything else does not   i bought the vehicle expecting reliability   good performance   and decent looks for the price   the looks are mostly intact   although the paint is scaling and flaking in spots   particularly on the top of the vehicle   i never got the reliability and performance has been decidedly spotty   the taurus provides good acceleration   when the transmission is working   and reasonably good steering   although it doesn t corner very tightly   it does have a reasonably roomy interior   although we ve experienced major fading and cracking of the hard components such as the dash   the major problem with the vehicle   anything that can fall part   frequently and expensively does   currently   the gas gauge doesn t work   and whenever the weather is cold   the speedometer doesn t either   consumer reports lists the   taurus as a car to avoid   and i must agree   buy the vehicle only if you can do your own repairs and don t mind lots of grease monkey time   if you don t know your way around a chilton manual   forget this car     
173,0,  we bought a   taurus almost   years ago   it seemed to be in fairly good shape and drove well for a short time   the first sign of problems to come was the cv joints   after they were replaced   the brakes squealed badly even after the pads and shoes were replaced   then the famous check engine light intermittently throughout the drive   but   saving the best for last   the notorious transmission bug has to be the best icon for the   taurus they should condsider changing their logo   no downshifting on highway exits   no upshifting when entering a busy street spontaneous shifting up and down while going down the street   or my personal favourite   the no shifting   no up   down   sideways just no gear at all just a loud screaming transmission then a sudden neck cracking lurch into nd gear and on a related note   i have no speedometer now thanks to the transmission   currently relying on a radar detector to avoid tickets   lol but to be fair   i will say that   when i am not getting whip lash from the jerky transmission   which i can find no mech to work on for less than twice what i paid for the car due to the   quot upgrades quot   made to the   model s transmissions   or wetting myself from the ever worsening loose steering   it is a comfortable ride with lots of room front and back but in my opinion   a   speed bicycle would be a better deal br br  
174,0,  i just got rid of this vehicle   my family bought it used in   and it was my first car that i had driven from the moment i learned to drive until just a few weeks ago   during the time that i owned the vehicle the rotor cracked causing the wheel to fall off   luckily while moving slowly   the air conditioner went bad around k miles and never really worked again after several repairs   the transmission started failing before k and finally went out around k miles   i had the transmission replaced and it began to fail only k miles later   the water pump also went out and the brakes began to stick   even though only the first rust spots were beginning to form on the vehicle   it felt as though it was only a matter of days before something else would go wrong   so i traded it in for a   pontiac sunfire   unfortunately   the dealer would only offer    for the trade in value because of its poor condition   this poor condition   after    miles was only the result of regular wear and tear and more than    invested in repairs over the course of   years   if you are a regular mechanic and think you can get a bargain on this vehicle then go for it   but otherwise i would recommend steering clear br br  
175,0,  my husband and i were needing a bigger car after our nd child was born   we wanted something larger than our civic so that we had room to grow and wouldn t have to buy another car for awhile we saw this beautiful burgandy taurus   it had great features   it had only    miles on it   it had power windows   doors   steering   airbag etc   the interior was very clean also   it in a dark burgandy suede feeling like material   the dealership said that it had been a rental car in hawaii   so we figured that maybe it was a pretty good car we wanted it really bad   it was a closeout and they were offering a pretty good deal on it   we ended up buying it and brought it home   after about a month or so   the air conditioner went out on it   my husband took it back to the auto store that we bought it from and they hesitantly fixed it   there were a few other weird things that went wrong with it   we decided to sell it   because we both thought that it would die on us any minute   my sister wanted to buy it from us   thinking that we were making up the weird things in our heads   we hesitantly sold it to her thinking that if something went wrong   she knew where we lived   etc   when we sold it to her   we had took the miles up to     she hadn t owned the car even two years   when she got stranded   miles from home   because the transmission went out on it   a year or so later   the engine went out on it   they ended up selling the car   it was a bad apple   they also ended up having to replace the struts on it   now   i know that we weren t hard on the car   in fact   i really only drove it around town for errands   etc if you are smart   you will stay away from this year of taurus   i don t know about the other years   but my husband and i have not had any desire to own another one br br  
176,0,  wow   out of curiosity i started reading the taurus reviews   they only confirmed my suspicions   i think the taurus tends to be a lot like a cocker spaniel   if you know cockers you will find they come in good and bad   it seems they have two very different temperments   laid back and affectionate would be type one   nasty and very apt to bite is the second type   with the taurus you have the dependable joy to drive car   and also   the   found on road dead   type my    taurus couldn t have been a better car for me   we did have a period of unreliability due to a bad alternator   it took   tries to get an alternator that would work for more than a day or two   but that can happen with any car   after that   it was clear sailing all the way   i really can t say too much bad about this car at all i bought this    taurus in    from a dealer we paid     for a nicely loaded car   it had all the options i could have wanted   my favorite options being the automatic windows and seats have continued to work well   needing no repairs as of yet   now that this car is almost   years old i couldn t really complain too much if things started to go although   i hope it continues to hold up for awhile   this is absolutely the most comfortable car i have ever driven   i am just under    tall and still i need not worry about sitting on a pillow or anything stupid like that   i have had that problem with other cars in the past   the automatic seats adjust all over the place making it easy to get a comfortable fit   also   they are very easy to adjust even while driving   i like this because if you start to feel cramped   tired and uncomfortable you can just move a button or two and the change of position eases the discomfort right away the body of this car has held up well   we are very bad at keeping it washed and waxed and it is just now starting to show some rust   we are also very bad at managing to get the oil changes on time   still the engine is doing fine   nothing has really broken down on this car   we did have to replace the knobs recently that work all the heating and air conditioning settings   they just seemed to wear out and fall off a lot   the only really annoying thing we had a problem with is that the trunk had a tendency to pop open while you were driving down the highway   we did manage to correct that problem   now   i feel safe and secure when driving this older car around   it has always been very reliable   i never had any problem with getting stuck anywhere due to a car problem as good as this car has been   i am starting to get a little worried   i do know a lot of people that have had nothing but trouble with the taurus   and we are some of those people   we also have a    taurus that i hate   it has been just as unreliable as the other one has been reliable   there is    miles on the taurus i love and a lot less on the other car   it really shouldn t be in the condition it seems to be in   i have heard that they tend to die about the time you hit the    mark   i do know that several that have done that exact thing   i am beginning to get nervous about driving it because of the record of some of the others   i want to buy a new car soon   or a   new for me but slightly used   car   i would love to have another taurus but because i keep hearing bad stories about the taurus owned by others   i am leary of doing this   i must make up my mind soon   if i don t get another taurus i plan to try to find a car as similiar as i can to the taurus   it is the perfect size and shape for me  
177,0,  you might be asking why i named my opinion   quot turbo pinto quot   well as a high school graduation gift my father gave me his old   taurus sho   the car was purchased brand new in    with every option you can think of   the color on the outside was white and the interior was black leather   the vehicle has   horsepower and it is a stick shift   in the two years that i drove the vehicle it has been repaired at least once a month   the repairs alone would cost more than    and the mechanic would take up to a month to fix the problems   in the two years i owned the car my father spent out over    fixing the problems   at this time i was just starting college and needed a reliable car to drive   my taurus did not do its job   problems i encountered the last time i drove the car were the temperature of the car was always hot due to the coolant holder always leaking   electrical system would malfunction during warm temperature days   the brakes sweaked profusly    my favorite one   the air conditioning system would only work for ten minutes and last but not least the factory stereo broke   i do not recommend buying this car   it is a complete lemon   my taurus deserves the title of turbo pinto   it is unreliable and will put you in the poor house by the amount of the repairs cost     
178,0,  we bought a taurus a few years ago it was a    we bought it because it fit our family   well when we bought it we had to replace the transmission and the paint on the hood was chipped   now it is   and it is already needing another transmission and the paint is really chipped off of the hood   the check engine light is always coming on and it stalls out on you   we have put so much money in this car   i am afraid to buy another taurus thinking that it will have the same problem after a few years br br  
179,0,  i bought this car used from a dealer for     i thought that was an excellent price since the car was in perfect condition   i mean not a dent   scratch   spot on the interior   nothing   the guy said it needed a new head gasket so i thought with a mechanically inclined husband that was great   well   we bought a gasket kit for    and did the job and sure enough the gasket was split   well   how exciting the car is back together and ready to run for the first time   won t start   needs a new converter but that was ok because sometimes that could happen when you blow a gasket because of the antifreeze getting in there   well    there   ready to run   sounds little rough and doesn t shift properly   had to fix transmission   gears broken   by doing that job we found broken rear mount   axles   cv joints   coolant lines     completes this job   once again ready to roll remind you i haven t yet got to drive the car   runs rough and oil light comes on at idle   i need new bearrings and a crank shaft currently i have only driven the car for little test rides after each job and now the car is sitting for sale in front of my house after    and the cost of insurance and registration   etc   i refuse to do the job because at this i feel that if i do there will only be another problem lurking   all these problems and the car just now hit     i will never as long as i live   own a car  
180,0,  my little sister owns a   taurus   and i ve got to admit it really sucks   now   i m not trying to cut down in any way   i just think they can build a better car   this particular taurus has a    l v that barely has a downshift   and couldn t go fast if your life depended on it   and i m talking about when it was brand new   now   it s even worse   the suspension is too rough   the transmission shifts too hard   and the over all quality of the interior is just   well   tacky   not only is it too plain   but it reminds me of something you would see in a   volkswagon van   now   i have to admit   the stereo and sound system are pretty good because i installed them myself so i know   i asked her if i could take it around town for a little while and see what it sounds like and see if i can get anyone to look and try to see where the music is coming from   people did look   well that s beside the point   while driving her car   i realized that it is just a pile of scrap metal on wheels   i don t know what the newer model taurus handles like   but this one can t and won t perform   i believe i have told you enough of about the piece of mobile junk   so i ll quit taking up your time   thank you   that is all mac   
181,0,  no   i m not a princess but a few years ago   my parents decided to buy me a new car   since they were trading in my escort   they wanted to stick with a product and i was ready to go for something a little bigger   with   doors a few days later   my brother appeared with a nifty new green   tempo gl    doors   with almost all the bells and whistles   it was mine and then i discovered the fit   even though the tempo is bigger than the escort there s less interior room   i felt stuffed like a sausage   still   it was new   it was a gift   and gosh it had ac and power locks and an airbag i ve had it   years now it s strictly a train and back car so i ve only got k miles on it   in other words   it s likely to last forever   and it meets my needs   however   as a big person   this is absolutely the most uncomfortable car in the world   it requires amazing contortions to get in and out   and the wheel is right in my chest when i drive   i m only    quot   and even with the seat back   my legs overshoot the pedals who did they design this for as for reliability   it s had its share of woes   the sparks went at k   so did the tires   it s had its share of buzzes and whirs   all requiring     treatments from my handy neighborhood mechanic   i put a new exhaust system on it at k   the battery has never really taken to winter if i could do it again   i d have taken another escort   no offense   mom and dad   i can t wait to trade up br br  
182,0,  i bought a    tempo   years ago for      its a c didn t work and i haven t tried to repair it   when i bought it   it had     and now it has a little bit over      so far the biggest problem with it was the electrics   cruise control would work   but if i went over a bump it would stop working   windows go down and up at their will   i hate the brake   i have to put a lot of energy into stepping on it to reach the stopping point   i don t think that it s very stabile   the only thing that kind of makes me happy about owning this car is that it never had any major breakdown   it s engine works just fine   and i have taken it to several road trips   if you get annoyed by little things   then i guess you shouldn t buy this car because they break all the time   if you want to get something that will take you from the point a to the point b   than it s ok br br  
183,0,  we have bought this car in feb    and kept for   months because the car was really cheap   the car has been working satisfactorily   but the car requires maintenance every months causing minor problems here and there the car has    miles and we had to fix so far as follows the cost of labor includes   starter    front end    alternator    a hole in radiator      new radiator    a c not fixed yet     door lining tipping don t bother fixing them   this car has been teaching us how to maintain the car because it breaks down very often  
184,0,  i own a   tempo   ever since i bought it i have had to do nothing but put money into it   the car was great for the first year or so and after that i ve been spending about    a year in repairs   the tie rod design is very poor and they need to be replaced about every    miles   i had to put three alternators in it already   and the front end has given me lots of problems   this has been a very costly vehicle to own and i will never buy a again   i ve had nothing but problems with mine and haven t heard anything good from anyone else about fords   unfortunately i can t afford to buy another car for a few years so i am stuck with this lemon for awhile if i don t go broke first     
185,0,  beginning around fall of   i told people interested in buying a mid sized suv that they should wait until a totally redesigned explorer was introduced in january    it ended up being delayed a couple of months   but in march it finally arrived   i promptly took one for a test drive and posted the following review on march    at the time there was no   listing   when a   listing appeared i reposted my review to its current location i ve never cared for the explorer in the past   it was based on a very dated chassis designed in the early   s   this showed in how it rode and handled   like most suvs   and nearly every american car thirty years ago   the explorer used a body on frame construction   the based frame was far too flexible for such a heavy vehicle   combined with soft body mounts   between the body and frame   used to help the ride   this resulted in a vehicle that shimmied and shuddered over even minor road imperfections   so why did i have high expectations for the new explorer   the first one was thrown together in a hurry on a tight budget   no one at the time knew suvs would turn out to be so hot   now knows   even more than that   it knows that the explorer is the best selling of the all   that this makes a huge amount of money for the corporation   and that the japanese are finally waking up and fielding some top notch suvs   put all of this together   and knew that its continued financial success depended on redesigning the explorer so that it was the best   i d like to maintain the suspense as to whether or not the new explorer met my expectations   but you ve most likely already seen that i gave it three stars and a   not recommended   so you ve probably already guessed that i was quite disappointed once i had the opportunity to drive one   but if you want to know why i was so disappointed   you ll have to read on    what s new for    why were my expectations so high for the new explorer   in an acronym    irs   no   certainly not the internal revenue service   the other irs   independent rear suspension   truck based suvs like the explorer generally have a solid   or   live   rear axle   this means that the wheels are rigidly attached to the end of a solid metal tube that contains the heavy differential in the center   when you hit a bump with such a suspension   this entire heavy axle and wheel assembly absorbs the shock without the mediation of any springs or shock absorbers   because so much mass is set in motion   it has a tendency to jostle the entire vehicle   it s a matter of simple physics   force equals mass times acceleration   to help absorb so much force   the springs and shocks have to be made softer   what s more   the solid beam transmits anything that happens to one wheel to the other wheel   so   all else being equal   a vehicle with a live rear axle usually handles and rides significantly worse than one with an independent suspension on all but perfectly smooth roads    with an independent suspension only the mass of a single wheel tire brake assembly is upset when one wheel hits a bump   so why don t suvs simply have independent rear suspensions   well   live axles are better for the sort of serious off road driving few suv drivers actually do   this is why jeep uses a live axle in front as well as in back in all of its vehicles   until the new liberty comes out   live axles also tend to be more durable when driven over rough terrain   finally   and this is the most important thing for a like   they are very cheap and easy to manufacture   take all of this together   and you might understand why i suddenly had such high expectations for the new explorer when i learned that was going with an independent rear suspension   because an irs is so much more expensive   i took this as a sign that was doing whatever it takes to make the new explorer have excellent on road ride and handling   this is after all the same that only recently has made an irs available on the   and even then only with the top of the line cobra   information that the all new frame would be far stiffer than the old one provided further evidence that this might be s goal   i have now learned that also had other benefits in mind   namely   they wanted to open up space in the rear for a new feature   an optional third row seat   going with an irs made this seat possible   even though the new vehicle is just a tad larger on the outside than the old one   sure   it is a cramped seat   much like those in the acura mdx and durango   but many people want a third seat for kids   and for them it should do just fine   going with an irs also allowed for the amount of cargo room to be substantially increased and for the cargo floor to be significantly lower   anyone who has had to put a lot of stuff into an suv will probably realize the significance of that last improvement   some other improvements are worth mentioning   in the powertrain department   the   horse ohc six is largely carried over   while a   horse eight is new   the latter replaces the venerable    which saw its final duty in the explorer   the new eight is based on the base engine in the expedition   but has an aluminum block to save weight   while the old eight was paired with a four speed automatic   the new one is paired with the five speed that only the ohc six came with before   the extra gear is between first and the former second   this should improve acceleration beyond first gear   since rpm will not drop as much after the shift   keeping the engine in its powerband   the eight is a    option   are the extra thirty horsepower necessary enough to be worth this much money   read on   styling is not among the major changes   most people probably won t even notice that the styling has changed   that said   the new design has sharper creases than the old   lending it a more upscale appearance   the mercury mountaineer   the explorer s twin   has more unique styling than in the past   with a front end that people are likely to either love or hate   personally   i prefer the classic styling of the   i admire what they have tried to do with the mercury   the trendy brushed metal thing   but don t feel they have quite pulled it off    accommodations and amenities   with the above knowledge   i took a trip to the dealer   things started to go wrong as soon as i hopped into the driver s seat   you sit high   too high   i got in   and the sunvisor was just barely above my line of sight and it was up   and i m not a tall person   only     hmmm is the seat all the way up   i hunted for a power seat button   and found a rotary knob that adjusts the lumbar in and out instead   was there no power seat in this vehicle   i figured there had to be   i was sitting so high   somehow my hand found it s way between the adjusters for the lumbar support and the recliner and found the control for the power seat way down there somewhere   the seat was up   but only about an inch   even in the lowest position i was sitting too high relative to the windshield header for my personal taste   the dash is quite low   providing excellent visibility forward   the seat could be lower and still leave the driver well above the top of the dash   why isn t it   beats me   or why didn t they simply extend the windshield higher   the top of the roof is well above the top of the windshield   again   i haven t a clue   maybe i m unique in liking the windshield header well outside my line of sight   i don t know   i certainly don t like having it so low   it s like having a baseball cap on all the time   i don t like that either but maybe the market for these trucks does   somehow i doubt that was the logic involved   aside from the header issue   front seat comfort is ok   they provide an average level of back support   nothing to write home about   good or bad   in terms of comfort   they could look nicer   though   the fairly small cushion with a rounded front edge just looks econocar ish   the rear seat raises even more questions than that low header high seat in front   in the new vehicle there s more room back there   enough to fit a very comfortable seat at a very comfortable height   as it is   the height of the cushion is about average   which is to say just a bit too low to adequately support the thighs of someone my height   few vehicles do have a sufficiently high rear seat cushion   so i can t complain too much about this in the explorer   i can and will complain a lot about the height of the rear seatback   it s really low   as if it was designed for small children   so low that when the headrests are down all the way they press into the upper part of my back   this is actually more comfortable than you would expect   felt kinda nice having them there   the problem is that in this position the headrest provides zero whiplash protection   i couldn t raise the headrest because the seat had the plastic on it still and i didn t want to be the one to remove it   i assume you can raise it about a foot   as crazy as that sounds   because otherwise the rear seat would be unsafe for tall people   at the same time   i doubt many people will raise the rear headrests so much   most people leave them all the way down for aesthetics and driver visibility   so this seat seems unsafe to me given how most people will configure it   and hard for adults to nap in on trips   a final safety detail   the center belt is lap only   the spec sheet touts all of the stuff has done for safety in the new design   including all sorts of airbags   this makes it all the more surprising that they blew the most basic safety stuff   why did make the rear seatback so low   i suspect it has something to do with the low cargo floor i mentioned earlier   this is great for loading cargo   but it means the second row seat has to fold that much lower to form a flat floor   which forces the seatback to be smaller   this is my hypothesis at least   i didn t fold the seat down   so i haven t tested it   does provide two levels of vents for rear passengers   with a switch to select between them   this is nice   but some of the competition   namely gm   is now doing far more for rear passengers   did do an excellent job with the cargo area   it s large   usefully shaped   well finished   and very easy to access   first   there s that low floor   so you don t have to lift stuff as high as you do with other truck based suvs to load it   then   there is the matter of the liftglass   it is nice to be able to open the rear glass without opening the entire tailgate if all you have to do is throw in a shopping bag or two   the problem is that suvs tend to be so high off the ground that it s not always easy to throw something in through the glass   with the new explorer   has addressed this problem by having some of the door open with the glass   so that it is like a door within a door   this reduces the liftover to a very manageable height   the xlt i drove was about halfway between the base vehicle and the top of the line limited   it had your basic amenities such as power driver s seat height adjuster   power windows   cruise   etc   but no more   nothing you won t find in your typical taurus from hertz   at a price of      perhaps this is all i should expect   after all   if i want more stuff there is always the eddie bauer or limited   and whatever options are available on them   except no matter how much you load onto the new explorer   it s going to still feel cheap   it s a matter of the interior materials   they look durable enough   so i guess   cheap   really the right word   but they look durable like materials designed for heavy duty commercial use do   this interior looks like it was designed for a work truck   not one often used as a family vehicle   not to mention one bought more and more as a luxury vehicle   the styling of the interior reinforces this impression   it s a very plain   very functional design   like with so many aspects of this vehicle   nothing to write home about   good or bad   except that it s not good   which if you want good is bad    on the road   as many faults as i found with the new explorer before even driving it   they might have been forgotten if the vehicle delivered in the ride and handling department   after all   that s what i was really looking forward to trying out in the first place   so how well did the impressive spec sheet translate to the real world   not well at all   i was sorely disappointed   even in moderate turns   i didn t attempt any aggressive maneuvers   the new explorer leans heavily and plows   heavy understeer   the steering is fairly decent for an suv it s only a bit on the light side for my tastes but there s just no joy to be had here   irs or no   this truck remains a sloppy handler   the sole bright spot in the handling is a very tight turning circle for such a large vehicle   i wish my compact car turned this sharply   and it s not just that the springs and shock valving are too soft   handling has not simply been sacrificed for ride quality   fairly minor imperfections in the road surface made the entire vehicle quiver   i suspect the body on frame construction has something to do with this   the old explorer seemed to have soft body mounts to help the ride   with the result that the body would shimmy on the frame over bumps   though the new truck is definitely an improvement   it seems this trait has been carried over   very sad   worse   every bump sends a shudder up through the steering column   i like to be able to feel the road through the wheel   but at some point road feel becomes   kick back   don t get me wrong   the ride is generally comfortable   these problems may even be most noticeable at low speeds over minor to moderate road imperfections   but all of this shimmying and shuddering makes the new explorer feel far less solid than the stats on the new body and frame suggest it should be   these sensations say   work truck   not   family vehicle   and definitely not   luxury   the main quality lapse i noticed in the vehicle i drove was a minor squeak in the dash around the instruments   there may be other problems lurking   the launch of the new vehicle was delayed about six weeks to fix lingering quality issues   overall i suspect quality will be about the same as with the old explorer   which is to say about average   maybe a touch below average   on the sparsely populated positive side of the ledger   the new explorer is fairly quiet   in contrast to the smaller escape   road noise is especially low   i had to strain to hear the tires   which for the record were michelins   wind noise is moderate even at highway speeds   unfortunately   more bad news is not far away   the six is just barely up to moving this much vehicle   thankfully added a gear between first and what used to be second a few years ago   so that once the transmission does shift you remain in the engines powerband   i never felt like the engine was letting me down i could accelerate as quickly as i d want to in regular driving but the engine makes a lot of noise while going about its work   it s not an entirely unpleasant sound i ve certainly heard nastier sounds coming from engines   but it always seems like the engine is working quite hard   if not quite straining   in regular driving   using about    throttle to accelerate   the transmission shifted at about   rpm   this is a fairly high shift point for regular driving   a bit more throttle   and the tranny shifts at   you get the idea   so while this engine moves the vehicle well enough   i suspect fuel economy will be very poor   high shift points will do that   all in all   between the suspension and the just adequate engine the new explorer was not at all fun to drive   maybe suv buyers don t expect their vehicles to be fun to drive   i personally do   so this alone would be a deal killer for me   the eight will not be available for another month or two   i might test drive a v limited once one is available   i don t expect the difference to be large enough to sway my basic opinion of the vehicle   but there is always that chance   update       i recently drove a mercury mountaineer with the   horsepower v and leather   the eight performed only marginally better than the six   it lacked the torquey feel engines of this size usually have   as with the six   even half throttle resulted in      rpm shifts   this engine should not have to work this hard   i have no idea why it does   at any rate   the six in the gm suvs performs much better than s eight   the mercury s two tone leather made for a more luxurious interior   but parts such as the console detracted from the ambiance i did not do any off road driving   given the on road experience   i do not expect this is a good vehicle for serious off road driving   the suspension is too soft   the handling too clumsy   and the vehicle is just too big for that sort of thing   of course few people use explorers this way   for light duty suv stuff   like driving on snow or unpaved roads   it should be adequate    last words   has a lot at stake with the new explorer   from the spec sheet it appears they went all out to guarantee that the explorer will continue to be the best selling suv   the inclusion of an independent rear suspension is especially impressive   unfortunately   while the size and utility of the cargo area is exceptional   the new explorer surprisingly falls short in many other areas   this fact was highlighted by my second test drive of the day   gm has also just introduced totally redesigned versions of its mid sized suvs   there s no irs   there s no available third row seat   at least not yet   and gm has fallen short so often in the past that i didn t expect nearly as much from these new vehicles   once again a test drive surprised me   this time in a good way   for details   check out my review of the gmc envoy   though the gmc stickered for quite a bit more than the   i suspect that they cost about the same comparably equipped    once comprehensive pricing information is available i will update this part of the review   as for   i d advise a bunch of quick revisions to the new explorer   otherwise   they can kiss their market leadership goodbye   a mediocre suv was good enough in the past   but the competition is not staying still   so mediocre just isn t going to cut it much longer  
186,0,  explorer has taken a lot of heat in the media of late it is a great product and has been the mainstay of the line for a few years now   from time to time has tried some improvements   with the media after them relative to roll overs and firestone tires   i guess this was the time to really give explorer a new look there was a problem finding stashing places   where do you put the maps and the pocketbook and the wrench and those little items most of us carry around with us when i got in for a test drive the salesman pointed to the door and said here is the spot for your water bottle   well   my fifty something neighbor down the street never leaves home without her bottle   i must be the camel in the neighborhood   i was not impressed   unfortunately i discovered that little curve meant i had less leg room   the caddy in the center console has a crazy useless configuration in my   explorer   there is a definite improvement in the stashing capability in the redesigned console   but then the seat is smaller   since   my butt has gotten bigger and the explorer seats have gotten smaller   that is where all the hidden space has come from they have a car like riding truck   i had no complaints with the old ride   but now my mother in law will not have to be hosted up into the passenger seat   the explorer is closer to the ground but my husband can not ride in the front seat   the height clearance inside the cabin is lower   he hits his head and the man is only over six foot not seven foot the explorer is wider on the outside   but not on the inside   with narrower   smaller seats all those stashing places are useless   i can not fit comfortably inside with all my stuff by the way there are also extra seats in the back   great for car pooling   that is if the members of the car pool are kids   it is not seating for adults   there is no leg room   you have to climb in like a amusement park ride to get back there   i would never ask an adult to do so   especially if i was picking the crew up at the airport the ride is great and i am sure the reliablity is as good the visibility out the front window is also affected if you are an average sized person  
187,0,  i get a new windstar lx as a vehicle every year and i am disappointed by the lack of quality in this   model   this is compared to previous windstars   not to other makes and models   this van was made at the oakville ontario plant this is a minivan   not an expensive sports car   with that in mind here are my observations ride   smooth and comfortable except for the out of round wheels and tires on this particular van making it vibrate at highway speeds   handling   this is a minivan and it handles like one would expect it to   at high speeds   over    it doesn t like to go straight without constant steering corrections   at really high speeds   over    it can be tiring to drive as you are trying even harder to keep it in your lane   maybe this is how all minivans are   i can only compare it to our town car which drives fine at ultralegal speeds acceleration   quite good   this van has the    engine and has adequate power   the   model doesn t seem to blast from    like the   did   maybe they changed the gear ratios   it s still pretty good though transmission   not bad   shifts smoothly and usually picks the right gear for the conditions   much better than some other fords i have driven although not as good as gm s i have driven   brakes   seem fine to me   the pedal pressure is just right and the van seems to slow and stop just fine noise   generally a pretty quiet vehicle   the engine makes quite a bit of noise at full bore as compared to other vehicles but it is noticeably quieter than the   model i had several years ago   interior   the front seats are great   i ve never used the back seats   one of them is in my garage unused   so i can t attest to their comfort   the kids haven t complained though   the back seats are the full width ones and are very heavy   one person can remove and install them if you want a backache so i always get someone to help me move the seats   i think other companies have done a better job at designing the seating on their vehicles reliability   so far so good   hasn t broken down yet   in previous years i have not had to do any repairs to my windstars   just normal scheduled maintenance quality   what happened   this one has both front doors and the right sliding door and the rear hatch door all squeaking in unison as i drive down the road   two wheels are out of round which causes vibrations at highway speeds making everything that isn t adjusted properly shake and squeak   i can see that the rear hatch door and the right sliding door are not adjusted properly and do not close tightly against the weatherstrip   the front suspension makes squeaking and grunting noises at low speeds   this is probably not a design flaw but an assembly goof   i would accept these flaws from a   year old vehicle with lots of miles on it but from a new vehicle   none of my previous windstars were this poorly assembled   btw   this is the first windstar i ve had with the stamped   el cheapo wheels   the kind that need full wheelcovers on them   in previous years the wheels were the cast aluminum one piece   no wheelcover   wheels and they were fine  
188,0,  i recently received a new   windstar as a vehicle   i have to say that this was an extremely bad choice   first off   the body styling is very boring compared to the rest of the mini vans on the market   the nose is long   the body is a box   and there are no accent lines to   spruce   it up   the interior is equally as boring   except maybe for the cd player   the rear seats are bench style and not bucket style as was in my chevy venture   this makes it difficult to get in and out   even for the smallest person   when removing the seats   you have to take the whole bench out   instead of simply one seat which is a headache because of the weight   i doubt that a mother of three could attempt such a feat   the space in the rear behind the last bench seat is non existent   i m not sure why it even exists actually   should have eliminated the space   and backed the seats up a little bit for more leg room   if pushed   the engine is loud and sounds like its going to explode as it sucks down the   gallon gas tank in a matter of   miles   the ride is not bad   but the stereotype of driving a boat is in full force here   the transmission is a little choppy for a new vehicle   can t imagine what it will be like at    miles   was never known for their transmissions in the first place   the steering column seems to be a little off center in relation to the drivers seat due to the dash board design   the only pro i can see only applies to myself   and that is that it is a free vehicle for me   unfortunately to all of you   you ll have to shell out   grand for this beauty   do yourself a favor and shop around   i guarantee you ll find a better selection at a different dealer  
189,0,  my wife leased a   explorer january   it has been a nightmare ever since first problem was with the transmission   it started leaking   month after we got it   they decided a new seal was in order   it went back to the shop a total of three times before they figured that the transmission was defective   then came the recalls   one for the cruise control then the front hood latch then for a defective windshield washer which would come on intermittently   to this day we are still having problems with it now the airbag light stays on and the rear windshield washer refuses to work   we had another problem with the check engine light this is our first vehicle and quite possibly our last in the early day fords were ok   but now the quality has suffered br br  
190,0,  i bought my   explorer in april of   factory ordered   since then i have had approx    recalls   that is annoying when i have to keep taking it back to the dealer to have something fixed   i have put    miles on it and have had it in the dealer shop six times for repairs   from fixing a window to the windshield washer and wipers not working   i had to get new tires because of the firestone suit   when i went to change the new tires   i had to pay for it up front   which was more than     i had to borrow   i was reimbursed within ninety days   cutting corners has about given me a heart attack on several occasions   i m not the best driver   but the potential for my explorer to flip over on a tight corner is high i m not totally against my explorer   it s roomy   comfortable   seats five people legally   it has plenty of space in the back for traveling   safety rods that run across the back space   i use the rod to secure my groceries   air conditioning   a cassette radio   i asked for a cd player and never received one   i also asked for running boards   didn t receive them   gold trim   got black trim instead   i m finished experimenting with suv s   next time i think i ll buy a mercedes   maybe it s the dealer to blame   but all those recalls   i say something was made wrong  
191,0,  my first stop for car shopping was toyota   due to my previous experience for reliability   the mini van was too mommish   amp   the suv ceiling seem low   floor board high i then went to   because i liked the look of their suv   enough room for   young kids   amp   all the consumer magazines gave it overall good ratings   after one week    different dealerships   amp   more than eighty percent for a down payment   i should ve taken this as a sign once i finally purchased my   explorer xlt   i really loved it   i had the few options that were important to me   the fleet representative was very nice   the finance was within budget   amp   the insurance didn t dent my pocket well   i was into month    miles of owning this vehicle   when i notice the transmission starting to slip   i took the car to the dealer for a recall issue   amp   mention the trany slips   of course the repair gentleman thought i didn t know what i was talking about   it wound up the cylinoid bracket was a factory default   the parts had to be ordered   amp   should be in within a couple of days   i was covered for car rental for   days   but it didn t pay for the insurance   week one goes by   amp   no call from the service dept   i had to contact them   because the rental was only covered for   days   the parts were still not in   amp   then had to place me in one of their rentals   a taurus   ok   i should say   thank you   they gave me something new the rental agreement was for    a day     max coverage   everyone knows    probably wouldn t cover a dented bumper   after numerous phone calls to the service dept   claiming the parts hadn t arrive yet   i call their service mgr   who never returned any of my calls   so i had to go a step further i then mailed a certified letter to informing them of this issue   amp   letting them know i was aware of the   lemon law   i also sent written notifications to the california consumer affairs   cartalk   better business bureau   amp   other consumer advocates   such as those we see on tv by day   of having my car in the shop   amp    days of rental on a taurus   the service dept calls me   informing me my car is ready how convenient   day   would ve qualified me for the lemon law the gentlemen in the service dept who kept in touch with me regarding my car stated that i caused some problems for them   oh   did i mention that particular service mgr was no longer at that dealership this incident left me with nothing good to say about   if they had told me after week one   my car would ve been in the repair shop for a month   i would ve known what to expect   temporary insurance change   so i could feel safer about driving their vehicle if nothing else did cover my rental expenses   and my car seems to run ok   but i plan on trading it in before the extended warranty runs out or i pay it off   i don t want to end up like beccam   now   i know why i haven t owned an american car within the last   years   next time i ll go with what i know toyota   i wouldn t recommend my worse enemy to purchase a i ve only owned   brand new cars and this was the first to give me problems within my first    miles   usually   they fall apart after the warranty has expired or you ve paid it off after reading all the positive epinions of explorer owners   looks like i ended up with a   quot lemon quot br br  
192,0,  one year ago driving by my local dealership i noticed a sharp looking suv   so i turned around and took it for a test drive   pleased with the price and the way it looked i traded vehicles   i was very pleased with the way it drives for the first week   then came rain   having owned two suvs before this one and had no problems driving during bad weather   well it was a different story for the explorer   it s very hard to handle on a wet road   and if the wind is blowing hard you might as well pull over   besides driving during bad weather i have been haunted with recall letters i think i have had   so far and i am sure there will be more soon   now lets talk about quality parts that the explorer is made of    months after the impulse buy that i made several parts stop working first thing to go was the back windshield wiper   well it works when it wants to not when i need it to   then my fog lights   ground lights   work when its warm   haven t figured that one out yet nor has the dealer   any suggestions   also when i turn on the turn left signal my wipers come on and then go off   i m no expert when it comes to wiring but is this not a short in the electrical system   now the cigarette lighter does not work    there are many other small things about the explorer i don t like but i guess that s what i get for impulse buying   and after going through all of this in less than a years time    i would not recommend the   explorer sport to anyone     
193,0,  the only title the explorer can lay claim to is the best selling suv in america   it certainly can t call itself the most powerful   the best looking   or the best handling   in a nation where the camry outsells any car   the best selling suv title may not be so glamorous   and the facts will back that up the base engine in an explorer is a little    liter   horsepower deal left over from the early explorer days   coupled to a manual transmission   this engine is slow   sluggish   and a good choice   seem paradoxical   consider this   the next level up is    liter v with   more horsepower   yet it is not a big step up for the money     figures improve by only    seconds and quarter mile times by     still not convinced the base engine is the way to go   consider the top level engine   it is a    liter v with   scoff    valves per cylinder   given a whole extra liter of displacement and   more cylinders to work with   the engine only gains   horsepower from the next step down   most surprisingly however     in a v explorer will take you   seconds   as opposed to    in the considerably cheaper base model   i m almost always a fan of a bigger engine   but in this case   i say save your money   why shell out more for an   valve cylinder v that only goes slower than the base   and has   miles per gallon   quot efficiency quot    note   the v carries more torque   so if you need to haul something   e g   a boat   you might consider it   but for hauling kids   keep your money roadholding in an explorer is characteristic of an suv   that is   a lot of body roll   a lot of bounce   and a generally uncomfortable ride   again   the base model shows its true colors   with a skidpad reading of   g   opposed to only   g for the v   likewise   suspension is nothing revolutionary   it is a step up from the pickup that it s based on   but still bouncy   on the plus side   the explorer is safe   given its standard airbags and disc brakes   but please stay away from firestone wilderness a t s   it is also roomy   accommodating   people well    people who are not susceptible to motion sickness   and   people for short hops br br  
194,0,  i own a   new explorer sport for about a year   i already had   warranty repairs and that s a brand new car   after   weeks the abs module broke which also caused the odometer and the speedometer to fail   it took my dealer   visits to figure out that the abs module was the problem   a couple of weeks later one of the rear safety belts broke and last week the of the rear end wiper died   then there is still that rattling noise close to the moonroof which no dealer was able to find the cause of   also there were two recalls by   after getting that fixed   suddenly my wiper come on whenever i turned or gave a turning signal   this has stopped as suddenly as it appeared   maybe i got an especially bad assembled car   but it makes one wonder about the quality assurance at the explorer sport is a really nice car if two people are riding in the car   to get to the back seat is kind of hard   the cargo space and room that the explorer provides is great   it is easy to load big stuff into it   i have the comfort package with the   way power driver s seat which is really great if two people of different height use the car   it is very easy to adjust the seat and it provides a lot of   quot fine tuning quot   of your seat s position for the looks of the car i would definitely recommend the premium sports package driving the explorer on a bumpy road is like riding a camel   very shaky   when turning on wet streets the rear end of the car is skidding which doesn t make you feel very safe in it   when making longer road trips on a highway it is a very comfortable   nice to drive car   i still love my explorer   sometimes it s a love hate relationship   but i would not buy one anymore nor would i recommend it to anyone br br  
195,0,  my wife loves the explorer but she is    quot   tall   i m    quot   and this vehicle is not made for people our height   we had an xlt for   years and upgraded to an eddied bauer with a sunroof   big mistake for me because i can t sit straight up   also   when will learn to place their rearview mirror higher up on the windshield   i think they are the only manufacturer that still mounts the mirror to the windshield so it s right in the way   also   the seats do not have any head restraints for somebody over    tall   i m surprised has not gotten dinged for this   the limited version has this option but this is not the standard model overall   my wife loves it so we re stuck with it but i do not recommend it to a person with above average height br br  
196,0,  i loved my    explorer xlt for the first   months   then we went back and bought the suv we d originally intended to buy   the    expedition   there are   main reasons why i traded up to the    expedition eddie bauer   drivers seat comfort   cargo space   and highway noise   i began to realize that my back really was hurting every day and suddenly it dawned on me that my beloved new suv was the culprit   i was driving about   miles a day   quite a haul i agree   but i had never experienced back pains like this after driving   the driver s seat is not comfortable for a   pound woman   even with all the ergonomic gadgets adjusted   the pain was still there   as i had previously owned a compact   the explorer was huge at first   then i realized something   there s not as much cargo space as the brochures lead you to believe   if you re a mom like me   a lot of   quot stuff quot   gets carted around daily   strollers   car seat   diaper bag   etc   add groceries or plants from the nursery and there is no room for folks   my mother and father could not ride comfortably in the backseat during a visit   even without all the junk   and this was frustrating for everyone on the highway   we found ourselves turning the radio up higher only to notice that on regular streets   we were blasting ourselves   there is a lot of outside noise in the explorer   much less than the expedition so   we made a painful decision   take the loss and get another suv that will really fit our needs   we ve owned the expedition for a month now and love everything about it except the locks that lock automatically when you step on the brake   seems pretty cool until you realize how often the passenger hops in and out getting mail   checking on baby one last time   fetching diaper from back   etc   and i m still working on getting into a parking place on the first try but that s another story br br  
197,0,  we purchased our   contour sport gl with a   valve    cylinder engine in october of    what attracted us to this vehicle   it was nearly new   it was in our price range and it was a pretty blue color   in addition   all of the literature that we read about the   contour was very positive   performance   handling   and fuel economy were highlights of reviews   from what we read in the   lemon aid   book   the car represented excellent value for money   however   having lived with the car for the past   months   i m not so sure that all of the press that the   contour received was entirely accurate   i think this car would have rated as above average within its class   but my problem with this vehicle is a lack of confidence in its quality and safety   i will address all of the realities of the contour   both good and bad   including the numerous recalls   and hopefully you will be able to better make your decision i would like to begin with commenting on all of the great things about the   contour   first   this thing handles corners like nobody s business   it hugs those bends and turns   and what that translates to is a solid   secure feeling through the car and steering wheel   who doesn t like to feel confident of the way their car handles   this vehicle is definitely above average in this regard   and this feature is possibly my number one favorite in the   contour next good thing about the   contour is its acceleration abilities   it does really well getting up to speed in good time   whether merging on the highway or zipping in and out of traffic in town   this car can meet your requirements   i feel that this is important to note   as several people will shy away from a   cylinder as it feels like you re driving a turtle   i m sure the   cylinder just flies by comparison   but the   cylinder is far from disappointing in this regard   lastly   our contour is absolutely great on gas   we get excellent mileage   i m certain this is due largely to the fact that this is a   cylinder vehicle   and given the prices of fuel these days   this is definitely a   big   plus   now   i have seen reviews that differ on this point   but they do not say if they are the   cylinder vehicle or the   cylinder   we had some diagnostics done earlier this year   and the results determined that we get about    kilometers to   liter of gas   things could be very different for the   cylinder contour   but if you are looking for an economical vehicle to operate   consider this vehicle an option   now   onto other matters   yes   the contour definitely has a dark side   since we have owned the car   there have been   recalls   one to adjust the wiring for the airbags to ensure that they actually do go off when needed   and one to readjust something with the rear brakes so that they would not seize in an emergency   i know of one other recall to do with the headlights   but we asked our dealer and apparently that problem was resolved with our vehicle with the previous owner   so   well   there have been at least three recalls   let s face it recalls are a little inconvenient   but stuff gets fixed for free   so who cares   right   well   let me ask you this does the number of recalls reflect the quality of the vehicle overall   i think it does   as a result   i m not entirely confident of the quality of the vehicle   what else is looming in the future   will be get the next recall notice   or will we be in an accident that leads to the next recall which leads me to my big issue with the contour   and with itself   last saturday morning as we were zipping along the highway   my husband and i immediately noticed a very strong burning smell   my husband is a diesel mechanic   and he said it smelled like burning wiring   all of a sudden    light gray smoke   starts pouring from the glove compartment and dashboard   my husband pulls over immediately   and we haul the kids out of the car in record time   my husband then opens the passenger door   pulls down the dash panel   and rips out the offending article   a plastic three way switch and the plugs that had been in it were totally fried   resulting in the wiring burning and the plastic socket burnt and melted   fortunately   the car is determined still operable   and we are able to drive it to our dealership when my husband relates the tale to the woman at   she is very understanding and sympathetic   she even goes so far as to tell us that she knows the exact problem they ve seen    quite a few b   she tells us that the problem will be fixed free of charge   we ask her    if this is such a common problem   then why hasn t there been a recall on the car   she then told us that usually something else goes before the problem gets as serious as this   so when the customer complains of the other problem   they fix the entire thing gratis   has not determined the need for a recall as of yet   she must have noticed the stunned look on our faces   because she quickly said   but no one should have went through something like this   hmmm you know   i think she s right    no one   should have to go through this experience   but people have   quite a few people   apparently   so why hasn t issued a recall to prevent another   possibly more serious incident from happening   maybe this is like the freestone tire issue there has to be a certain death toll to make results happen   in conclusion   we had previously considered the   contour a really good car   we liked it   we truly did   to me   it was a good car that handled well   had a peppy four cylinder engine   and was an economical drive   but now we have to ask ourselves b do we have confidence in this car s quality and safety standards b   the answer is a resounding    no b   frankly   i have also lost a lot of respect and confidence in the as well   i can t recommend this vehicle to others in all conscience   despite our previous level of content with this car   as their are just too many uncertanties and questions surrounding the safety and quality of this vehicle     
198,0,   no one b b introduction   what was thinking when they designed a four door car that is capable of   mph obviously   when their fastest sedan is just as fast as their mid sized engine sports car   they ve done something wrong   the designers of the contour should have looked less at the engine and suspension and more towards comfort   interior   exterior   airbags   headlights   while the designers of the should have at least tried to compete with chevy s race oriented cars b pros   knows how to do paint   it has a beautiful paint job if the headlights didn t explode   they put out adequate light   and the fog lights work good for daytime i guess for a mid priced sedan   this thing moves pretty well     in   seconds   its agile too   with very little body flex in sharp turns if you really want one   resale sucks   so you ll be able to get a fully loaded   model for     ok   that is it for the pros b cons   the headlights and airbags were recalled   the headlights explode   the airbags   won t go off in a crash    the cruise control will get stuck on    resulting in a crash    the throttle cable may fray   not returning to idle position    resulting in a crash    the rear brakes may lock up and refuse to unlock    resulting in a crash    if you own one of these cars   take it to the dealer immediately to get these things repaired   that s only the first two years ownership   god knows what will happen when quits recalling and they start exploding like pinto s on cold mornings   sometimes this car refuses to start   battery problem   sensor problem   i don t know   it starts fine when it is warm b it seats no one comfortably    maybe people who stand five feet tall and below   on a recent trip with four adults   each and every one complained of being cramped   the seats are almost comfortable   maybe if there was more leg room   they d be bearable the dash board is a joke   i m used to dash boards where you can put things   this one is sloped towards the front seats   and anything and everything placed on the dash board will eventually fall   this is so the airbags don t throw anything into you if they go off   but don t worry about it   they   won t go off   has to stop trying to make their cars and components look like their emblem   ovals do not make for good climate controls   nor do they flatter the exterior of this car b road noise is terrible    vibrations at freeway speeds are horrible   never mind trying to go faster than that   it feels as if the entire car is going to fall apart   after an alignment   it got a little better   but didn t go completely away to change the oil   you must drain it directly onto an exhaust manifold   which   of course   smells very bad until it all gets cooked off   the muffler is welded to the frame   which will make any replacement expensive   the radio antenna is motorized   which makes for a nice   clean look   but once that servo goes and you know it will   it will be a pain in the butt to replace   or it can probably be rigged so that it is always up   since the cd player won t even work unless the antenna is up the gas mileage averages at    mpg    with a     liter engine    that is obviously ridiculous   a friend with a   sebring has the same size engine   and averages   mpg   on occasion getting as high as   b overall   this car has been deeply effected by the   quot b driver returns on foot   quot   syndrome   it is about time removed it from their line up   it was nothing but trouble the day it came off the assembly line   the model i speak of was a      which is a   refined version    i would have hated to see a   or before model of this car   they probably have a lower life expectancy than the mustangs at    years if you really want a family car with some pep   get the impala ss or an suv with a   vortec which will keep up just as well and afford better gas mileage if you really want one and are set on getting it no matter how bad it is   e mail me and i ll pray for you br br  
199,0,  first of all i have to say that the contour is a very comfortable vehicle and is a great family car   my fiancee and i own a contour currently and it gets us where we need to go   it is a pretty dependable car   the engine runs great and we have not had any under the hood work in a year   the problem however is the axles and the tires   the axles are weak and if not aligned just right the tires where extremely fast   i would have to recommend the car for familys but not for single young people with higher chances of accidents etc   once alignment is gone or anything happens then the cash starts pouring out of the pockets   something else is that the car looses value quickly   not a good investment if planning on selling it   i do believe that the car would run forever if taken care of but once the miles get on it then be prepared to loose some money   believe me   i know   well   the sum it all up it is very roomy   great engine   and great gas mileage   but on the contrary it depreciates quickly and often requires alot of body work   but we all have our own opinions don t we br br  
200,0,  i originally bought a new   contour a month after i got it i was not all that thrilled with it before i bought it i had a escort in which i had no problems with for four years the reason i bought the contour is because i wanted a car that was more comfortable and bigger the reason that i would not buy this car again is because they did not make the gas tanks very well at most gas stations i go to it can take up to   minutes to fill the tank because the pump will click off every   cents it has been doing this since i got it and i ve had it for   years   another reason is that it has had   safety recalls i just think that if you are going to put that much money into a new car you should not have to deal with these types of problems   it may be petty but after a while you get agitated while trying to put gas in your car when it is really cold outside there are good points to the car for example it drives pretty good and it is comfortable overall though i wish i would have gotten a different car br br  
201,0,  my husband was transferred from indiana to georgia and decided my poor little tracer just wouldn t make it on the racetracks they call highways in georgia   he had one free day to go to the dealership and trade it for something   quot bigger   better   faster quot   he came home with a new contour   i have been driving this car for over two years now and i love the fact that it keeps up with the   mph traffic on the highways   it does have a little more interior space than my tracer   but i have had no less than   recalls on this car over the last   years   some of them were for minor problems   but some of them were serious enough to have killed me or someone else   i also had a problem that wasn t even on the recall list   i would probably be much less upset about this had we not paid so much for this car   we paid over     for this car and the only options we got were air conditioning   not really an option in georgia   and a rear spoiler   no power anything   no tape or cd player   etc   i miss my tracer br br  
202,0,  when i rented a contour   i was very pleased with the performance   handling and economy of the car   in fact   i liked it so much that i bought one   now i wish i had bought a buick in the year and a half i have owned the car   there have been at least four recall notices and several service advisories issued   i have replaced one wheel bearing   at    miles   and my mechanic told me it was never properly packed with grease    i had over    miles on my previous car before i had to replace any wheel bearings   i now need to replace another bearing   the air conditioning does not work   there is a leak in a right front body seal that allows water to drip on the floor if the car is parked on an incline during a rainstorm   the left passenger door hinge groans and squeaks   the seal around the left passenger door allows road water in the door   and the carpet does not fit   i have replaced one front speaker and now need another one   i have also replaced the climate control switch   but it still malfunctions during very damp weather   when i need the defrosters most complaints to customer service and the better business bureau have resulted in   quot well   your warranty expired   so too bad quot this experience has not only put me off ever buying another contour   but possibly another product br br  
203,0,  after more than two years of mechanical problems   we finally sold my wife s   contour xl the other day   yes it gets you from point a to point b   but that s about it   her car was in the shop numerous times for all sorts of problems   i wrote to ask them about the quality of their vehicles and received a form letter in response thanking me for my feedback and telling me that values its customers   what a joke   can t build a car that comes close to standing up to honda   toyota   nissan   etc   and they know it   if you don t believe me   check the j d   powers list of autos with fewest mechanical problems   no fords on it   ever wonder why   if you want to spend your money on a car with less than average dependability and fit and finish   then the contour is for you   it rattles   shakes   and won t always run very good   but the good news is you get to visit the service department often and enjoy coffee with other owners     
204,0,  my wife and i purchased this vehicle when she was promoted to a manager at the restaurant in which she worked   we needed a second vehicle for her to get to work   this was not a leisure purchase   we decided to buy it at a dealer for which my mother works   kenny ross in irwin   unfortunately   the problems began at the dealership   even though i was immediate family to an employee   they tried to sell me the vehicle for almost    over the invoice price   luckily   i am an avid online shopper and visited the kelly blue book site before i went to examine the vehicle   or i may have assumed that i was getting a nice deal   this vehicle was purchased because it was the closest vehicle that had to a toyota corolla   we had a   toyota corolla that we finally traded in   after having driven it for almost    miles   compared to what we were used to   we like the vehicle for the lighting features   like interior lights that activate when the door knobs are pulled from the outside   this is convenient in the dark when you are trying to get in and start the car   most everything else about the car is horrible   for the size   it doesn t get very good gas mileage   nothing compared to the corolla that we had   it handles rough   i don t drive it frequently   but when i do   it is my wife s vehicle   i seem to have to work harder at controlling it   there always seems to be problems with this vehicle   i believe it has been recalled for at least   items   i lost count after that   some of the recalls aren t minor   there is still a problem with the vehicle over heating   they can t seem to find anything wrong   but i have spent plenty on fixing things that aren t wrong   i personally don t feel that anyone should buy this vehicle   this one purchase of a has convinced me that i will always buy toyotas   this contour has about    miles on it at this point and we are hoping to be rid of it by may    we just can t waste any more time with it in service   compared to the toyota that we own   the is driven less   but serviced more at a higher cost   i m sorry   but if that is the best that can do   than no matter whether my mother works for them or not   i d rather have the reliability of a toyota     
205,0,  i purchased a   contour in july of    i d had experience with the contour due to renting contours several times in the u s   and europe   its handling and mpg were acceptable to me so when it was time to bit the bullet   i paid   k new with only a few frills   overall   the car has been wonderful its that is working my last nerve   in the first year alone   i had to take the car back to the dealership that it was purchased from   times for recall repairs   what a hassle   that being said   i never noticed anything wrong with the car it is great for a small family   it fits a car seat and two people in the back seat   the roof of the car seems to be slightly higher than the taurus   so my   foot   husband could sit in the car rather easily   it seems to me that   while trying to introduce a car between the soon to be gone escort and the taurus   has not really thought through the building of the contour in america   my car was built at the kansas city plant and in spite of their kindly calls to see how i liked the car   they still built a car that had    recalls   update   it s been almost two years since i wrote that review   there have been more recalls   but at least recall repairs are free   the major problems have been coming out of my pocket   two months ago   i had to replace the tie rod ends and tires     and now the transmission has failed and needs to be replaced due to a bad clutch plate   dealership mechanics have refused to accept responsibility for this problem by saying   it s not our job to fix s mistakes   and   it s a lemon   you should get rid of it   corporate says   sorry   we make a bad car every once in awhile   luck of the draw   and that i should save my    transmission bill as there will probably be another recall on it   other contour reviews also describe major transmission problems   buy a kia    doesn t stand by their work  
206,0,  i don t own a contour   but i rented one for my class reunion in ga last weekend   i had the car for only   days   but i noticed immediately many of the ups and downs of this automobile i currently own   cars that have amazing stereo systems in them   one has an incredible   speaker nakamichi stereo   see my lexus ls review also   the contour had a very basic   speakers system that took some getting use to   the most obvious problem was the deck wattage output   with the volume all the way up   sound quality was poor and distortion from any amount of bass was unacceptable   i ve heard some of the mach systems in other fords   so i know quality is in reach if a potential buyer needs something better in georgia it is humid almost year round   so a top notch ventilation system is a must   the contour has that down pat   the ac worked very well with simple knobs and switches for easy operation and it blew very cold just how i like it   acceleration was a disappointment also   flooring the gas pedal resulted in a lot more noise than movement   which was quite a let down for a modern day v   handling was a pleasant surprise   especially cornering   taking a quick turn wasn t at all a frightening experience like in some cars this size   but the rattles from the interior made me wonder if something might fall off the next time the classification of this car has a lot of competition   the nissan altima   toyota corolla   mitsubishi galant   and saturn make it a crowded field in the similar price range   i ve driven the all new nissan sentra and i think it s a hidden treasure in itself the contour is an acceptable vehicle for the die hard fan that will never consider another brand   but the competition is stiff and many better cars are out there for the taking at a comparable price br br  
207,0,  i bought my   contour in december of   because i was looking for a reliable car   since that time   i have had to take it in for   recalls   air conditioning stopped working and needed new coil and unit   fumes coming into car   they haven t been able to identify the cause as of yet   and they don t know yet why the car is beginning to be difficult to start   all of these problems require drop off at a dealership   waiting for a ride to work   or making other arrangements   or getting a rental car due to the work not being completed by end of day    which translates into missed time from the job   i have a strong feeling that this is only the beginning of the constant repairs i am going to have with this car i like the design   leg room space   and comfortable ride of the contour   i dislike car repairs and unreliability i will not buy another again   nor would i recommend a to a friend br br  
208,0,  i bought this vehicle because i read an article in   quot consumer reports quot   stating that this was a top quality vehicle and i liked the way it looked and handled at first   however   my respect for   quot consumer reports quot   went down rapidly   this vehicle is nice to drive when you aren t carrying a load of any kind and when the sun is shining   the is a nice looking truck with comfortable seats and is good for those sunday drives   however   the is also a truck with very little power for hauling trailers or carrying any loads   such as for moving a desk for the office or a chair for the living room   the is also a truck that is very expensive to fix and requires alot of repairs that need to be done at the dealership   where costs are much higher   for example   i took my vehicle into my mechanic to get a diagnostic done and the diagnostic came up with nothing wrong   so i went and got a second opinion and still nothing was wrong   but my engine light was still on and i needed to know what was going on   finally i had to take my truck into the dealership and get a diagnostic   which cost       tax   they found the problem and told me that trucks need to have diagnostics run on equipment to get an accurate reading   there is nothing about this in the owner s manual   this vehicle is also very poor in inclimate weather   in rainy   icy and snowy conditions   this vehicle is like driving a bumper car on the road   any poor road conditions and this vehicle turns like a whale and slides like it is on a   quot slip and slide quot   child s toy   basically   this is a very poor excuse for a pick up truck   this vehicle should only be bought by people in warm weather climates   who just need a nice looking cruise around pick up truck   and who can afford to make repairs two or three times annually   anyone not meeting this description should stay away from this pick up truck br br  
209,0,  the is a decent pickup truck for light loads   i bought this truck for moving stuff like a lawn mower and stuff like that   i loved this truck because it drove really smoothly and it looked pretty sharp   i hated this truck because it has no balls   i mean come on a truck is suppose to be manly   the only way i can feel like a man is if i can wax someone at a stop light   good luck doin it with this truck   the sound system in this truck is terrible   the speakers are for old people who do nt like to crank it   another reason why it is not a good truck is because of the sad engine that they but in these   come on a v in a new truck is not needed anywhere   if you want a truck that can do something other then pull a small trailer with a small load i would nt recommend this truck at all br br  
210,0,  i was on vacation in florida in   and during that time i had the opportunity to rent the   convertible   i drove it for more than a week   so i think that i was able to see the good and the bad sides of driving this particular car engine and transmission the that i drove had    liter v   in it mated to a   speed automatic transmission   the engine was adequately powerful and didn t need to downshift a single time   no matter what the road was   it was a silky smooth engine too   with deep   low   satisfying engine note   as a matter of fact i mistaken it for v   at first   but then out of curiosity i opened the hood   and saw that it was a v    the engine sounded just like v    the transmission that the engine is mated to is very smooth also   with barely noticeable shifts   even the kickdown was smooth   and that s where good stuff ends handling the car handled like a van   slightest turn and the car was rocking and rolling all over the place   while the car has very good ride in the straight line   doing a very good job isolating driver from the road bumps   if you need to make a turn   and i am talking about just a slight turn   not something extreme   you better have your seatbelt fastened   or you have a good chance of landing somewhere outside of the car   granted it is a convertible   so it is not as stiff as a coupe   but still   it is considered a sports car afterall   so it should at least drive like one design and ergonomics the car looks good from the outside   it has nice curves but without boy racer look   so it appeals to both older and younger drivers   the visibility from the driver s seat is very good   the front seats are cramped for such a large car   it is as long as many sedans   and wider than most of them   but it is pretty cramped in the front   and i am not even mentioning the backseat which is suitable mostly for children   i am   feet tall and weigh   pounds   which is pretty average   whoever was in charge of ergonomics should ve been fired or limited to designing floormats for yugos   the door release lever is below driver s knee   in the most awkward spot   right where you would never expect to find it   it took me a while to find it the first time when i was trying to get out of the car at night   none of the window switches are lit at night   same goes to power locks   there is no trunk release lever inside the car   so you need to get out of the car   and either use the key or button on remote control   on the fifth day of driving the car   i finally found the controls for moving the driver seat   they were located in the front of the seat   power seat in this case   and not on the left or right edge of the front side of the seat   but right behind driver s legs   when you try to open or close the top   you have to use the two levers   one on each side of the windshield   which might be troublesome for a single person   in thunderbird   they finally replaced them with single central lever   which is foolproof and easy to use   the heating cooling controls were designed in the dumbest way possible   for example   if you use air conditioning   you can not direct the airflow to the desired spot   because there is no separate button for a c   rather there is separate position for a c on the same knob that is used to direct the airflow   so if the knob is in a c position   it can not be in defog position   i could not use the a c for longer than   minutes   since i was wearing flip flops   florida   and was risking of freezing my toes off to be fair   took care of most of these stupidities in their thunderbird convertible   but it also costs twice as much as the i drove in the end   i would not recommend this car to anybody   as after short period of time   the feeling of rip off will set in   as you start thinking about how much money saved by giving the interior design job to a group of   detroit bums  
211,0,  i don t own this car   but i have driven and ridden in it as a passenger   this review will share some of my experiences in the car first thing   the car makes bumps feel like craters in the ground   you will feel every little pothole in the road will tooth jarring clarity   sometimes when driving the car when i hit a bump   my arm smacks the armrest   made out of hard plastic   and my arm feels like it fractures   this does not say a lot for the struts shocks or the armrest next item   the car sits straight up and down   i thought that i would be lying down and driving with an arm extended   but this is not the case   i sit very up and down   just like driving a regular non sports sedan   one nice thing is that the driver s seat has a lumbar support that blows up to the size of the goodyear blimp   if you have a crampy lower back   this is nice   however   there is no passenger lumbar support the car has good leg room   as i am     and do not feel cramped   especially in the passenger seat   the headroom is ok   but the car is cut in such a way that i have to be very careful when getting in and out not to smack my head   once i had to bend over so much to get into the driver s side that i pulled a muscle in my chest and was in pain for the whole next day the car has an annoying feature of the window opening all the way when just pushed down a little on the driver s side   since i like to crack the window even in the winter   i hit the down button just a touch   but the whole window opens   however   i am told this is standard on new cars   as is the lack of a cigarette lighter   so i suppose i ll just have to deal with it the car has standard airbags   but no head airbags or side airbags   so just make sure that if you plan on crashing   you get into a head on collision   not a side impact on the plus side   the car has a nice sound system and it looks cool to drive around in   the color is nice too   and the thing really moves   the v in the gt has a lot of power and great pickup for highway merges  
212,0,  driving the with its hard seats   lack of lumbar support and a hard as a rock suspension is like riding a real and you will get saddle sores i looked over the field before i bought the and it had the power edge   all i was interested in at the time was power and edgy looks   i also just had to have a convertible   however   all that changed when i realized that i spend very little time looking at the car and a lot of time being beaten to death by it on the road   it feels like it will break apart over some of the bumps   it is also very loud inside the car   i can barely hear the stereo at cruise   there is a lot of rear end whine   it sounds like a big rig is passing me but there is no truck there it wasn t long before i was wishing i had bought the celica   i shouldn t have gone and looked at the celica once i bought the because i could kick myself   the celica is much more quality oriented   the ride is smoother and the image suggests that i am not a redneck idiot   suggests a redneck with grease under the nails and an inferiority complex  
213,0,  i bought a   because of the looks and when i test drove it i enjoyed the ride   i had always wanted a since before i got my license and i had just that for my first car   the car looks very sporty and has plenty of curves   it comes with either a v or v engine and hard top or convertible   the seats were very comfortable with the exception of there not being much room in the car   if you want a roomy backseat though   this car isn t for you   it can feel a little bit cramped though   the controls on the car are easy to reach and not difficult to figure out   and being short   the power seats were very much appreciated   it comes with basically power everything   seats   windows   door locks   it also comes with tilt steering and airbags   and four disk brakes   abs at that time was an option for the car i believe which i didn t have   it even has one cup holder which is convenient to reach exciting isn t it   i recommend the having a spoiler because without one it doesn t look right to me   i bought the car without a spoiler and ended up buying one down the road   i loved how the car handled corners and the acceleration was decent for a v   with good tires and a dry road   it holds the road very well and hugs corners nicely   i thought the interior was very well done and it was a big improvement from past year mustangs which looked cheap and lacked taste   i prefer the more recent interiors over most other car manufacturers because they seem more appealing and are better made   the car was horrible in the winter   well   if you consider going up a hill sideways in the snow bad   of course   any sports car in the winter is a challenge to drive   when you drive this car you can feel every bump in the road and it gets to be uncomfortable after a while   things tend to shake and rattle in the car at times   because of bumpy roads   but for the most part this car is best suited for an even   well paved road because then the road is smooth and relatively quiet   the gas mileage for the highway is very good   it gets about   miles to the gallon on the highway   local driving it gets about   to   depending on the stop and go of driving   with the gas tank only being    gallons going to the gas station at times happens frequently but when you drive all over the place it is expected   the one thing against and their sports cars compared to chevy is that the older mustangs are a little bit underpowered considering what the camaro has even though with the newer model mustangs they increased the horsepower   to my best knowledge   the     l v has about   horsepower with   pounds of torque which to me isn t bad but compared to about   more horsepower with the camaro chevy puts to shame    if you want to see a comparison of the two i believe vara has a review on these two cars i do not reccomend this car to anyone who doesn t have the money for repairs or who doesn t want to sink a lot into the car   why you ask i ll tell you   first of all   my transmission went at    miles and that was about twelve hundred to fix   i had another friend who had a   gt and her transmission went at about    miles   would nt even honor any part of the warranty and my family had been buying cars from that dealer for years   secondly   i had to spend another four hundred dollars to get the frame fixed in the back because somehow it had cracked and i have never been in an accident   the car sucks up gas like there s no tomorrow in the winter   it handles poorly in any type of bad weather condition and it seemed like any time i turned around something was going wrong with the car or something was breaking   then again   maybe i just had a poorly manufactured   my car has a very loud and obnoxious engine knock that wo nt go away except when i put high octane gas it in   when that is done   the engine purrs like a kitten and i love the way the engine sounds when i hit the accelerator hard   i have had a few problems keeping the wheels aligned and it has wore down a lot of my tires but considering i tend to drive it hard at times i most likely am to blame the most for wear and tear and the tires   if you have the money it can be worth getting but unless made better quality cars   it d be sufficient to say you might be throwing money down the toilet for this car   if you want looks   the is nice   but if you want reliability stay far away from this car   in my opinion   and i m not a mechanic so i can t say for sure   pounding this car while accelerating does more damage to the transmission than anything else   from what i have heard s transmissions are very weak and that is why the cobra only has a manual transmission because the automatic isn t strong enough   and to top that off i have been told makes a cr ppy transmission for the six cylinder cars anyway and its one of their worst transmissions   again   i don t know how true this actually is so i am not saying for sure i am right   either way   i do not recommend abusing the transmission and that goes for any car   for the most part   take it easy with the car   don t floor it from a dead stop unless necessary   once in a while is okay i m assuming but not constant   again   this car is a pleasure to drive on a nice day cruising the roads and even though i partially hate this car because of all the trouble it has had   its    miles strong and each time i have to go somewhere i still look forward to getting behind the wheel   at one point i loved this car so much i gave it a pet name   my car s name is billy   everyone say hi to my baby   billy   and when billy goes one day it will be missed i ll almost feel like i ve lost a child    i m not crazy really   just a little too attached     
214,0,  about a year ago i bought a gt to fulfill a dream   as many others   i always loved the   finally i was able to buy one   i was very lucky because i found one that was only driven on the weekends   the previous owner took really good care of it   everyone thought i had bought a brand new car   i wanted to buy a stick shift vehicle but this vehicle was in such good shape that i opted to buy it even though it was an automatic   a decision i have lived to regret   more on that later   driving this vehicle is awesome   lots of power even for an automatic   the seats are comfortable and the layout of the inside is shaped somewhat like a mini cockpit   it handles great in dry weather and handles better than expected on rain   do not drive on snow   take the bus   i love the rumble sound that comes out of the dual exhaust   i love the looks you get when you drive it   i love how you can blow away most of these little honda cars that have all kinds of work done to the engines and they still sound like lawn mowers   don t get me wrong i love honda cars i think they are the most reliable but not most powerful   yes the is a great muscle car   but that is it now for the negatives   for starters the gas mileage is unreal    miles to the gallon if you drive like a retired old person   if you drive like a   year old you are looking at about   miles to the gallon   the automatic transmission died and had to be rebuild for a whopping     the idle sometimes is too low and the car shuts off at stop lights   this is only a rare occurrence   the windshield wiper relay function works only on occasion   the ride is super rough   i live in ny and the potholes here are unreal   and in a they feel like the grand canyon   there is virtually no head room and no back seat room   the windshield is small and you will find yourself looking around the rearview mirror   the tires are expensive and don t last too long   so many little things i could go on forever   i do not comprehend why continues to build vehicles so unreliable and with so many defects   one would think they would have improved the quality by now and maybe have some pride in building their cars   the bottom line is this is not a car but a toy which has to be taken care of greatly and can only be abused on occasion   i would recommend having a small reliable japanese car that saves lots of gas so you can have that for everyday use and drive the only on the weekends   it will last longer and save you money in the long run   i personally will never buy a vehicle after this experience   even though i kind of love the and don t really what to give it up   i am looking into buying some little honda for everyday use     
215,0,  the was redesigned for    although it was still based on a modified fox chassis   called fox    that dated back to    hatchbacks were discontinued   but coupes and convertibles remained   compared to the previous generation   the    was longer   wider   and lower   the weak four cylinder engine was also discontinued   a   horsepower v engine was standard   while the gt used a   horsepower v   a borg warner t   speed manual transmission was standard   an electronically controlled   speed automatic optional   although all mustangs for   had   wheel disc brakes   anti lock brakes were optional   convertibles included a power top and glass rear window   with an optional rear defogger   cobras came with a powerful    liter   horsepower v   and were sold in limited numbers   with a stiffer suspension than ordinary mustangs   cobras came only with a   speed manual and had standard abs as well as a slightly different styling b exterior    the s pony car styling was redesigned for   with a sexy   more rounded body   this years body styling is a far cry from the boxy angular that debuted in    the front hood vents look nice   but serve no purpose   the cobra s   spoke   inch alloy wheels look great   the standard gt wheels look okay   but i prefer the cobra s b interior    my test gt made a lot of noise   if wind noise is not intruding at speeds above   mph   then the rather loud exhaust engine noise is   the interior looks very old school with cheap looking hard plastic everywhere   the controls are easy to use and reach   build quality is sub par   the front seats are comfortable enough for long drives   but for tall people like myself   there is just not enough leg room to stretch out and be really comfortable   i like the gt s power lumbar support feature   optional   it makes the seats even more hospitable   the long   heavy doors are a nuisance in tight spaces and when parked sideways on hills the rear seats are very small   there is absolutely no leg room for the long legged and even people about   feet   inches will feel confined   the mere act of entering the backseat requires a gymnastic that most people will find a hassle   just to get in   you have to duck under the low roofline   or risk bumping your head   squeeze between the seat and the doorjamb   and be prepared to have your knees digging into the driver s or front passenger s seat   if you are tall   trunk space is insufficient for everyday living   if you plan on keeping a as your weekend sports car   then there is enough room to carry a few golf bags and other stuff b engine    the standard engine is a    liter ohv pushrod v engine that produces   horsepower at    rpm   and   lb ft   of torque at    rpm   it is available with either a   speed manual or a   speed automatic   the v when paired with either transmission is adequate enough for most situations   but i did notice that when paired with the automatic   it was a little reluctant to downshift   the gt comes with a more powerful    liter ohv pushrod v engine   it makes   horsepower at    rpm and   lb ft   of torque at    rpm   with either transmission   the torque comes on very quickly   but has the tendency to run out of breath after about    rpm   other than that   there is more than enough passing power and a lots of low end torque   the cobra uses a modified version of the gt s v and produces   horsepower at    rpm   but the same   lb ft   of torque at a higher    rpm   although the cobra never feels weak at low rpms   its engine was tuned for more mid range torque and all but eliminates that weak top end feeling that ruins the gt model s fun   i averaged    mpg on the recommended premium fuel   but says mid grade   octane fuel is reasonable b handling    there is more than enough lateral grip in the corners   and overall is very fun to fling around corners   there is more body lean than expected in all models but nosedive is serious only on the base and gt models   i feel the steering wheel could be stiffer than it is on the base and gt models   but the cobra s is nicely weighted for sporty driving   unfortunately   all mustangs of this model year have the tendency to have their tail ends   skip   around bumpy corners   all mustangs have a problem when it comes to handling in wet weather   all models spin the tires when trying to come up a hill after a stop if you are not very careful with the throttle   snow practically immobilizes the b ride    with a longer wheelbase and a few extra hundred pounds than the    model   the ride is still stiff   but not as jarring as before   the gt s suspension is poorly damped   and feels like it is crashing over large bumps   even on apparently flat   smooth roads   you can still feel the gt jumping on occasions   picking up even the smallest road imperfection   although the cobra model has a stiffer suspension   it rides very much the same as the gt b reliability    unfortunately   my test gt was plagued with problems   the owner received    no   that is not a typo   recalls during his entire ownership of the car   for more info about these recalls visit this website nhtsa dot gov cars problems not to mention the trouble spots   there is a chattering noise that can be felt coming from the rear during tight turns after highway driving   i read that this is caused by a defect in the clutch packs in the traction lok   positrac   differential   my test gt came with the automatic transmission   when i put it in overdrive   it had the tendency to slip   and then the engine would flare to rather high rpms depending on how hard the gas pedal is pressed   according to the owner   when the had about    miles on it   the transmission did the same thing   he said that he had replaced it with a rebuilt automatic transmission that had    miles on it and within    miles   started acting up again   make sure that if you decide to buy a gt with an automatic transmission   have a dealer check it for any problems b value    all mustangs deliver good performance at a reasonable price and should be an attractive buy for anyone at any age   the v model is more of a daily driver than the cobra or gt   but is not as quick   if you shop for a v model   it would be wise to have another car in your garage for when the weather gets wet or you need the cargo room to haul  
216,0,  i always wanted   quot the quot   and a convertible to boot   i bought this car after a divorce and i wanted something with some muscle and i wanted to go topless   these turned out to be the best parts of this machine   i liked the power it had although it needed more   and it gets a lot of looks on the freeway from the opposite sex   maybe because it was red   or topless who cares   it is fun to drive most of the time   i have not been totally pleased with the performance of this car   the first year it seemed to have a lot more power than it does   years later   i understand that an engine will lose some power   but i feel a significant loss in mine   it has been serviced well by the way   so i don t feel that it is the problem   it has also been in the shop a lot for some steering problems and items that should have lasted longer than they did   i like the tightness of the car and the steering   it reminds me of the   trans am if anyone has ever driven one   this car left me longing for much more power though   and i think i would shop around more the next time i want a sports car   if you want looks and a fun car to drive   you probably can t go wrong but of you want speed and performance   then look again   also   i do not recommend an automatic in this car   you lose a lot of power and performance as well as my transmission is going out at only    miles maybe that s why i call her   quot christine quot     
217,0,  i bought a   lx coupe for a decent price   but quickly learned it was not quite a solid vehicle   after having owned   convertibles in the past   i was confident that the new body style wouldn t have been a compromise in quality   but from the day i brought it home   it had problems   i was told that i would have to replace the transmission to fix the shutter   but a full servicing fixed that problem for the most part   it still didn t shift quite right   but the shutter disappeared   i d had transmission problems with my     so i was happy that it only cost    to get it fixed this time    but within   months   i was sorry i ever purchased the car   at k miles   the head gasket blew   when i called the dealership to get a quote on repairs   i was told there had been a recall on this car   so i took it down there after the engine had cooled back down   turns out   won t back their cars after k   and i was going to be stuck with        bill to fix it   i traded it in   got less than    of what i paid for it   and got a   thunderbird   and it s a very solid car   my strong recommendation   if you are interested in a     is to check its history   find out if it was recalled for the head gasket before purchasing it   because mine went fast   also   i was plagued with permanently squealy brakes that noone could figure out   so make sure it has a good radio to drown out that annoying noise  
218,0,  update   i am writing this update after owning my   focus wagon only     months   after taking my vehicle to the auto dealership to have them investigate why when the windows go down   especially the rear ones   an extremely loud and painful vibration occurs   when the service tech was in the car for a drive to understand the problems noted to him my husband rolled down the windows   the tech described the sound and discomfort to when his ear drum broke a few months back   as you can see the noise is painful   the tech then called the engineering department at to find out how to deal with the problem   the engineer had no idea as to how to fix the problem and said he had a stack of similar complaints on his desk   is selling focus wagons knowing there is a window problem   i am now in the process of finding out how to handle this problem   how discouraging to buy a brand new car and be making payments and can t even roll down my windows   beware when checking into purchasing this vehicle we are spending too much on gas for that van   i told my husband   with that comment i went on my search for a new vehicle i knew i needed and wanted something big enough to still haul stuff like lumber or my kids bikes   a regular car trunk just isn t deep enough for transporting lumber or long items   so   i knew if i wasn t getting another gas eating van it would have to be some sort of station wagon   now   narrowed down to body type i went on my search of different makes and models of station wagons   my first priority was price   being a family of   money is tight and i needed something affordable   but of good quality   i checked the prices of the vw jetta wagon and the saturn wagon   both were quite a bit more expensive   the focus was by far the more affordable of the three   having access to a a plan was another deciding factor   also at the time of my purchase was offering rebates and interests rates of    cash back     interest or    cash back and     interest we all know you get what you pay for   and maybe thinking it is cheaper because it is lacking in features   this is far from the truth   the focus wagon has standard features such as   power door locks   power windows   cd player   air conditioning and cruise control   unfortunately   abs breaks are not a standard feature and cost around    to have the option included the ease of getting in and out of the car was another factor in my purchase   unlike a lot of small cars the focus wagon seats sit higher   i really like the crank under the seat to adjust the seating height   i hate sitting in a car where my head almost touches the roof   that is not a problem in the focus wagon   the storage space in the back is extremely roomy and the pull over cover is an added plus   i went shopping for   weeks of groceries for a family of   and had no problems getting all the bags in comfortably   space is definitely not a problem the gas mileage is the most important feature of this vehicle   with today s gas prices going up this is a must feature to be looking at when choosing a new car   the engine in mine is a zetec    l   it still has pep   but doesn t need a lot of gas to achieve the goal   my first fill up   after driving about   highway miles and then some city driving also   i figured the focus wagon got around   mile to the gallon if you are looking for something affordable   roomy and has great gas mileage the focus wagon is worth the money  
219,0,  if you re looking for a commuter car   you ve found it   i own a door    aspire with no options   this car is basically a lawnmower engine surrounded by sheet metal   my friends call it the expire because if you crash in it you re bound to die   i m sure that s totally exaggerated   actually it has driver and passenger side airbags   that s about as sophisticated as the car gets   traction is ridiculous   those little bmx wanna be bike tires have hardly any surface area to touch the road   therefore breaking distance is pretty bad   if you live in a cold climate forget about it   this car doesn t like snow at all   as for ice   it s like sliding an egg across a frozen lake   power steering isn t needed   the care weighs close to nothing   a large group of friends can lift all four off the ground   i don t recommend it though   the interior is drab and cramped   seats are uncomfortably stiff   the manual transmission won t agree with your passengers   the stick shift hits their knees in th gear   the back seat is enormous considering the size of the car   the back seats two adults quite comfortably for a small car   the instruments are easy to see even though they are few in number   the doors are an ugly plastic as is the rest of the interior   no carpeted doors or nice dash for this puppy   now that i m done trashing the interior and tiny little tires   lets talk about performance   if you re really lucky   you might squeeze ponies out of that cylinder   you can floor it in just about any gear and not even feel the acceleration   try passing someone on a highway and you re in for a shock   when you drop down to th gear and floor it   the only thing that happens is the engine hits a high pitched whine   and the car doesn t go any faster   basically this car has no power   if that worries you   test drive it   you can t possibly image the lack of power in an auto until you try this one   nothing i can say will prepare you for the feeling of helplessness you encounter on an onramp in heavy traffic   you ll be struggling to hit mph with cars whizzing past you at    just close your eyes   cut into traffic   and pray someone slows down   it s not all bad though   this car does have one advantage   maintenance   the engine is as reliable as they come   it can take quite a beating and keeps putting out that unheard of mileage   i average mpg on the highway and mpg in the city   yup   that s mpg   with gas prices rising   that s an invaluable asset   on long highway drives i have even managed to get mpg   this comes at a cost though   not only does the engine have no power as is   but in order to get these wonderful mileages   you have to sacrifice even more power and shift with the yellow light   the light is on the dash and tells you when to shift up   first gear is wound up so tight it ll blow the engine at a little over mph and kill your mileage on the way there   nd can go to about mph or mph   but for gas you shift out of nd at about   or mph   rd can go to about mph   but for gas it s mph   th can go to about    at this speed the engine emits a high pitched whine   but for gas it s mph   th gear has no power whatsoever   notice a patern   you re in th gear by the time you re rolling   it takes forever to get to mph   and in the meantime you re only in the other gears for a few seconds   nothing else on the car requires much maintenance   it s a noisy   unrefined egg with wheels   but it ll get you where your going   if you have a kid and are worried about him her speeding   this is their car   believe me   the first time they try racing a friend   they ll be the laughing stock of their school   i ve been passed by a four wheeler before   the ride is bad   as is control   you ll be getting those little wheels balanced pretty often   overall   it depends what you re looking for   if you re looking for a car   you don t want this   if you just want a means of transportation at a cheap price   this is your egg     
220,0,  okay i wrote a review a couple of months ago that i have since deleted saying that the windstar was a great buy   unfortunately   i have had a change of heart and would not recommend it to anyone not even my worst enemy okay at least not the   version or any version with the   l v engine   i have had a nightmare within two months time coupled with      repair bill   first of all the head gasket blew and i had to have that repaired to the tune of       about one month later my van decided that it would no longer go into reverse   not a big deal unless you want to back up   so back to the repair shop it goes this time needing a brand new transmission to the tune of       i have yet to get this fixed because i simply can not afford it   so i hit the net and find out that has known for a long time that this particular year windstar has had constant trouble in this area   they did offer to refund     of the head gasket repairs but will not replace or help with the transmission which they are very aware is bad   their response was   quot well it is not on recall yet   when it is they will refund your money quot   hello am i the only one who sees something wrong with this picture   well i thought i was until i went to the consumer report page and heard some horror stories about the same vehicle   if you are looking for a used car   go to carfax and run the vin number and find out it s history   it is     that i wished i had done   now i am stuck with a car loan owing more than the trade in value and a repair bill that this one income single family can not afford   do not dump your money into this lemon   i hope others with other years never have the same problems   so far they have not had problems with the other years sometimes you can not take lemons and make lemonade br br  
221,0,  i bought my   windstar gl brand new in    i must have been drunk it was     with tax   and came with the   l mpfi v   i have been the only owner of this windstar and i always take good care of all my vehicles   personally changing the oil religiously every   miles   keeping them washed   engines always clean enough to eat off of   armor all the tires every week   etc   i am a car freak and enjoy taking care of my stable but within   years   this windstar received no less than   factory recalls some of the major ones are   defective head gasket   but they wouldn t fix or replace unless there was visible damage already   ie   white smoke   overheating   etc   the dealership told me not to bring it in for the   quot recall fix quot   unless it was already broken   grrr   hood separation at high speed   the recall notice said at high speeds    the flimsy plastic hood may separate   so they applied more glue to my hood   side door reinforcement   the sliding side door needed to have a beam welded inside it   the stupid fat mechanic that was working on my car cracked one of my inside door panels while performing this recall   when i informed the dealership of the damage   at first they denied it   they said i broke it myself   after complaining to the service manager and the dealership manager   they finally agreed to replacing the interior body panel the mechanic broke   but the part had to be special ordered   which took a week   and another few days for them to install it   grrr   transmission fluid pan was leaking like crazy   it was leaking atf fluid faster than i could pour it in   my van had first developed a slow tranny pan leak after about k miles   but the dealership told me it was a   quot normal maintanance quot   problem and not a defect   so i had to fix it myself   grrrr   gas tank reinforcement   the recall notice said the cheap plastic gas tank may crack or leak in high temperature conditions   so a flimsy metal strap was installed to   quot reinforce quot   it nitpicky complaints   the rear bench seats are very heavy   have a friend help you remove install the rear bench seats or you ll mess up your back   the window cranks   on non electric window   are in a very awkward location   almost all the way to the floor and toward the front   don t try to open close your windows while driving   seatbelts are very uncomfortable   rearview mirrors are awkward   especially at night   the air intake duct sits very low   sucking in air at tire level from the front driver side   don t drive thru even low flood waters or your engine will suck in water right thru the air intake duct   this happened to a friend of mine as he drove thru a small puddle and his   l engine was mangled needless to say   i will never buy a ever again   what a complete nightmare buy a toyota or honda instead   they are worth the extra money br br  
222,0,  i bought this vehicle used in    and for the most part was satisfied but leery   the vehicle served us well   but for a couple draw backs the ride was comfortable if a little noisy inside   and seats were excellent   configuration was ok   and we enjoyed and miss the electronic dash that came as an option   as far as draw backs go   we drove it on vacation to myrtle beach from ontario canada   and on arrival   fortunately   the head gasket blew   as per the recall   they would only replace blown gaskets not fix on spec   was good   i was in the states as a canadian   and covered it   including towing    in the final days as owner we had numerous problems with the ignition switch and undetermined mis shifts from the transmission   the ignition switch was   replaced   twice and in the end left my wife stranded road side while i was away on business   this was the final straw and we parted ways   myself and the van   not my wife   i was leery of the transmission noises as the van is rated poorly for transmission problems and my fears in this regard contributed to our decision to go japanese and get a   sienna   all in all i did not hate the van   but feel much as one does when a trusted friend starts to talk behind your back    betrayed br br  
223,0,  i purchased a   windstar in   with    miles already on it   from the first day we experienced problems that were minor and later had major problems   some problems were never fixed and were hard to trace   the car always   intermittent   indicated that one door was ajar   usually this happened going around corners and over bumps   we took the van back twice for service but the problem was never fixed   we only gave up on fixing this problem after several major problems overshadowed the minor one   the first major problem was the battery went dead   which by itself is not major   however we tried to jump start the car which ended up burning out the on board computer   battery cost plus tow was    the second time the battery went dead was within the next two days   again a tow was in order and a bill for    for the onboard computer   next the car overheated   and was localized to the water pump   again not a significant problem by itself but later the van continued to overheat   cost for the water pump   i don t remember but we eventually replaced the heads on the engine for     the overheating apparently caused the   quot service engine quot   light to appear   when diagnosed we discovered that the oxygen sensor was now faulty   estimated cost to repair about     now the o d   overdrive   light on the van began to blink and the transmission started to slip   i was told directly related to the overheating   a repaired transmission was quoted at between     we didn t even ask how much for the o d blinking light to be fixed the van had k miles on it in the end   we performed minor repairs on the transmission that cost    but the transmission still slipped but only when placed in reverse   we eventually got too frustrated with the van failing and using tow trucks and finally traded it in on a toyota rav    brand new   i ll tell you about the rav   in another review br br

225,0,  i bought this vehicle because of it s   star safety rating   as well as cargo room and passanger room   we are a family with   small children and needed a reliable vehicle   which was safe   roomy   and reasonably priced   since we bought it it s spent    of the time in the shop   although many things were covered buy the warranty   several were not   we bought it used in feburary of     weeks after we purchased it the first engine went due to head gasket problems    days after we bought it the engine went once again   due to poor installation    weeks after that the transmition went   in less than    miles we ve also replaced the air conditioning   the water pump   the temperature guage   and several gauges and sensors   which does not include regular maintenance   car rentals due to constant shop time   time lost from work or aggrivation   just last month the head gasket had to be replaced once again   it has an oil leak   which although has been brought to the attention of   different dealers   we have been told there is nothing that they will do to fix it   the transmition is leaking fluid on a quart a week basis   quite possibly the most annoying fact is that is offering a   quot buy back quot   program for the windstars currently   and because they have covered most of the problems    lt although not all   and certainly not car rental gt   we are not eligible for these programs   not that i would buy another   s customer service has been unresponsive to our problems   and dealer s continueally refuse to return calls   not only would i not recomend this vehicle to anyone   i wouldn t recomend dealing with either   before we bought it we had heard nothing but good opinions   and coincidentally   as they all reached    ooo miles   they all began having massive problems br br  
226,0,  note all of the bad things i am about to say about the windstar only affect windstars with the    litre engine   this is the engine used in over    of windstars   even the base models   but if you have one with the old underpowered    litre you should be alright my parents bought a   windstar lx loaded with most options in    it had about km on it   we really liked it   it was in perfect shape when we got it and we bought it from a dealership we had bought from before and they were really good to us   the bad part of the story doesn t start until our last year of owning the vehicle we got an extended warranty on the van because our previous vehicle that we traded in on it   a   mercury sable   had quite a few problems before the warranty ran out and we didn t want to have to pay a lot of money to keep the thing running   the extended warranty went to about km i think   for the whole warranty period we didn t have one problem with the van   it ran perfect   had good power   was comfortable and we really liked it   i can t remember us having any problems with it at that time the bad news happens later on around km we got a recall notice   actually an extended warranty on a defective product   stating that they will cover the cost of repairs to the head gasket on windstars up to a certain mileage and date   not very far ahead of the current date at that time   we took the van in to our local dealership   not the one we bought the van at   and this was a big mistake   they say they checked it out and the headgasket was fine   about a month later   past the extended warranty date for the headgasket   at km my parents were driving on the freeway and all of a sudden cold air blew through the heater   then my dad noticed the temperature gauge was almost as high as it could go   he immediately pulled over   when he opened the hood there was antifreeze everywhere   they got it towed back to the local dumbas   dealership   they looked at it and basically said   sorry   it s not covered anymore   it s gon na run you     to get fixed   needless to say my dad was kind of ticked off   the next decision we made was a good one   we called the good old dealership we bought it at   who we had been unfaithful to by bring the van to the other dealer in the first place   they told us they would come pick up our van   from the local dealership   and tow it for free out to their dealership   there had been a lot of complaints to and we were waiting to hear there decision on whether or not they would cover the cost   meanwhile my mom has to drive to work every day   a   minute trip   and my dad has to drive to work at a different time in the morning and a different direction   our only running vehicle at this time was the trusty old   pontiac grand prix   still running at this time   we called the dealership to see if they could do anything about this and the guy we bought the van off called and seemed to really make some noise   anyways in no time at all he got to pay half the cost and he decided to chip in    of the cost   this left us to pay only    of the cost and we were pretty happy about this   a week later we got a letter from saying that they were sorry but there is nothing they could do   this notice meant nothing because our dealership had already got to pay half   if he hadn t done that we would have been stuck with a big repair bill   in the end the dealership replaced the headgasket and while the engine was out they replaced the spark plugs which did need replacing and they also replaced a belt that was worn   even with all of this the total bill came out to about    which we paid    of   this was much less than the estimate the a hole at the other dealership gave us the van seemed to be running fine after this and we were planning on keeping it for a while still   however about a month later with about km on the van mom said something weird happened a couple times when she stopped at a redlight   when she stopped at a redlight and then started to go again she stepped on the gas but the engine just revved up like it was in neutral and then clunked into gear with a lurch   we had a trusted transmission mechanic take it for a test drive but it didn t do anything wrong when he was driving it and it didn t most of the time when we were driving it   he said he would have to take the tranny out to find out if anything was actually wrong and that s already getting into big money   we decided to trade it in as soon as possible on a smaller more economical car   we traded it in and it had seemed to be working alright until the day we were driving it in to pick up our new car   the worst possible time   it started going into neutral at stoplights a few times and when my dad pulled into the parking lot of the dealer   my dad felt terrible and was really upset by ripping off the dealer but if we hadn t traded it in we would have been broke   puts cheap a   parts in their vehicles that are known to fail and the customer ends up paying for it in the end our windstar gave us reliable transportation most of the time we owned it   the only other problem we had was when we were in florida the starter connections had gotten corroded and the van wouldn t start   we couldn t get it started even with a boost and had it towed to a dealer   they claimed it was a dead battery so they would rip us off when it only needed a new    part   dealerships suck   i only know of the one good one that saved us a lot of money on our blown headgasket   our windstar was totally reliable up until about km but that s when the whole friggin drivetrain gave out   this is unacceptable especially considering how much it costs to get these parts replaced   it s also almost impossible for most people to work on these vehicles   our   pontiac grand prix has never once been in a garage the whole    years we have owned it   we do all the work on it ourselves and have spent about    in repairs the whole time we have owned it the other day i just got off a long day of work and was driving in the grand prix with the windows up and the stereo turned up and there was a windstar on my right with a quebec license plate and he had his left turn signal on   i figured he didn t know where he was going and was trying to get somewhere so i slowed down a bit to let him change lanes in front of me   he didn t change lanes and i soon realized his had his   way flasher on not his signal light and he was going about km h in a km h zone   don t know why i thought he was turning   but anyways all of a sudden i realized i could hear an extremely loud knocking coming from the windstar engine   right away i thought of our old van and all the complaints about the windstars that i had read   i passed the van and a little ways up the road i stopped in at a car lot to casually look at cars and listen to the racket from the windstar as it passed by   i waited for it to come over the hill and i could hear it before i saw it   it was the loudest   most unhealthy knocking i ve ever heard from any engine   that engine had to be toast   it looked like they were just trying to make it to their destination and give up on the vehicle   if it s knocking that loud you don t keep driving it unless your not worried about fixing it anyways   it sounded like the engine was about to blow up right then literally   it s undescribable   i m a major car nut and obsessed with engines and this was kind of amusing to me to be able to listen to an engine in such bad shape     i thought it was fun but i definately wouldn t tell the owner of the van that   anyways with the amount of   windstars giving up the ghost out there   you are bound to see something like this eventually now that i ve told you all the bad things about the   windstars i ll talk about the good things about it performance   the engine had good torque and power at all speeds   the transmission shifted extremely smooth most of the time that we owned it   the gas mileage that we got was surprisingly good for a van with this big of an engine   handling was alright for a van and the brakes worked really good   comfort features   the front seats were really comfortable   the back seats weren t great for long trips and were impossible to fall asleep in but our van didn t have the bucket seats in the back   it just had   benches   the buckets seats   actually called captains chairs i guess   are a lot more comfortable   the air conditioning worked great with the rear air   there are vents in the ceiling that work good to keep all passengers cool   you can close the vents if you want   the rear heater was awesome   i guess it was kind of a safety hazard as it could melt a plastic bag if one was left right next to the vent on the side of the floor   but it sure heated us up fast in the winter   there are plenty of lights in the van all the way to the back so you can see in the dark   there was   power outlets in the van which was handy   sometimes i plugged in my discman to the power outlet at the middle seat so i didn t waste batteries and on our trip to florida we plugged a portable refrigerator thingy into the very back power outlet   this was really handy   the factory stereo only had a tapedeck and am fm but it was decent for a factory system   i also liked the design of the interior on this van   it was nicely done   it s hard to remember all the little features cause it was a while ago   but there were lots of them and it was nice safety most people know that the windstar got rated for   star safety rating so i guess it s pretty good for safety in a crash   not so safe to get stranded out in the middle of nowhere in the winter but at least your safe in a crash i guess anyways   as you can see i have plenty of good things to say about the windstar but i don t think they re worth it unless you re rich enough to be able to afford the repairs   in that case you could probably buy something a lot nicer than the windstar though   i have heard a lot worse   windstar horror stories   than ours since we only had the   major problems   i bet that guy from quebec could tell you a good story about his windstar   the newer ones have corrected some of the problems but on cartrackers   forums and then go to the windstar page   its the only vehicle that gets its own forum on here   lol or go to   my lemon   there still seems to be a lot of problems with the newer windstars   i wouldn t recommend one  
227,0,  i have edited this due to a very major expense   engine failure   on january      please read the bottom for new and very important information from the time we picked up our   windstar   we loved the ride   but   as many new vehicles are prone to   this one was in the shop for tweaking a few times this was probably an omen of things to come   as we have had the brakes replaced at low mileage   and under warranty   because claimed that they did not have the proper brakes to install in the first place when the vehicle was new   i still don t understand that one also   the   quot check engine light quot   is constantly on   we have had it checked out several times when the vehicle was under warranty and they have not been able to find any cause for it   nor could they fix it after the warranty expired   we needed to have the windstar serviced again because of an antifreeze leak   this turned out to be a recall notice item   but still cost us plenty   the nearly     in repair bills was due to the structure of the engine which needed to be somewhat dismantled so that the mechanics could work on the problem   labor costs   oh   they said that we could take the chance and not get the repair work done since it was so costly   but knowing that we could have major problems if we didn t fix it   what else could we do but shell out the money to my husband took the windstar in because of strange sounds in the engine area    weeks ago   and was told that   at    miles   the engine needed replacing   this will cost us      dollars   the extended   year warranty on this work will cost another       when the dealer was called yesterday to check on the progress of the work on the rebuilt engine   we were told that the lifters are bad   too   this will add another     to the cost   you bet will get a letter on this one and then some i thank goodness for the communication possibilities of the internet because i did a search on   quot windstar recall notice quot   and was alarmed to find that thousands of people who have purchased the   windstar are having similarly costly expenses and all seem to be pretty much the same in the nature of the repair work   although it is comforting    to know that we are among a large group of people having the same wallet draining experience   i believe that it is time for the rest of the   quot silent majority quot   to speak up   if enough of us get to the point of saying   quot i m not going to put up with the way we re treated by the quot   we should be able to force to put out a recall on the engine so that they must pay for the trash we are stuck with one last note before i end this ranting   through my research of dissatisfied customers on the internet   i learned that the recall notice on the head gasket problem was apparently not received by everyone   if you have not received this important notice   be sure to contact   for whatever good that will do br br  
228,0,  i bought this vehicle when expecting my first child   we chose the windstar because it had excellent safety ratings   i like the way the minivan looks and rides   i have enjoyed the car overall until the last   months or so   i received a recall in    on a certain engine part that could cause the head gasket to blow   i took the van to my local dealer   from which i bought the vehicle   and they claimed to find no problem and therefore would not replace a part that wasn t broken   the exact thing that the recall was for happened in november     i was informed that the recall had expired and they could do nothing for me   i had the problem fixed by an independent mechanic approximately two weeks later i received another recall on the fuel tank   this time stating that it could fall off the vehicle   i definitely feel that unless you are willing to deal with the recalls and repairs you should not purchase this van   i do not know of the status of the newer models   but i am not willing to take my chances and buy another windstar br br  
229,0,  and i thought quality was job    ha at    miles i replaced head gaskets and had the transmission rebuilt in my   windstar   ten months ago at    miles the engine was replaced   this is to say nothing of brake jobs every    miles and numerous electrical problems    i won t bore you with a long defense   but in case you re wondering   this van is not driven hard today i learned that the head gaskets must be replaced again but that i am    miles over the   month    mile warranty   refuses to bend the rules   now they expect me to invest more than    in head gaskets that may last   what   maybe    miles maybe     the bottom line is that they know this engine is flawed and they can t figure out how to fix it and they won t stand behind it take my advice   if anyone offers to sell   or even give   you one of these things run away screaming  
230,0,  i have   windstar that now has   miles on it   the van is great to drive and the interior has worn well and still looks great   but mechanically the poor has had it i had to replace the head gaskets at   miles   which was a    repair   this bothered me but i figured after   miles it could be worse   i then found out that knew this was a problem with all of their    liter v s that year and even had a program to replace the head gasket for free if the van had   miles or less   i contacted my local dealer and s   quot quality care quot   department   both said they could be of no help because i had more then   miles on the van   so i went ahead and had it fixed   weeks later while returning from a funeral out of town the van broke down and left me on the side of interstate   in the middle of the night   i had the van towed back home only to find out that it had broken a connecting rod and i have to replace the   a    repair my next vehicle will be an import   i also have a   toyota with   miles and have never done anything to it but oil   tires   amp   brakes maybe one day will be able to build a quality product and when they let a bad get off the production line they should stand behind it br br  
231,0,  my dad had always wanted a van   he had owned an ltd wagon   a white one with blue interior   it was the best vehicle we had ever had to this day   he decided to try again   he purchased a   model   white paint and white interior it was a good vehicle for the first few thousand miles   mind you as soon as the warranty expired   the transmission failed   it cost us over a thousand dollars to get it replaced   and to our disdain we find that the transmission was built with a plastic gear   who in their right mind would place a plastic gear in a transmission well   a few months later the head gasket broke   white smoke billowed out of the exhaust and the car overheated like mad   i did everything i could do to get it home   it cost us    dollars to replace the head gasket   it ran fine for a few days   but a mysterious knocking and loss in power suddenly appeared   antifreeze from the head gasket had worked its way down to the crankshaft and corroded the bearings   and because of this we had to replace to whole engine   with our horrible luck a week later we got a letter in the mail recalling our model van for the head gasket   and then   my father had to fight to pay us anything   initially they offered to pay us for the head gasket itself   which was only     then   he managed them to pay for the labor   the     but refused to pay for the engine which had failed due to their faulty gasket   we lost    because of s incompetence the car ran fine for an other year until the warrantees on the engine and the transmission expired   then   just our luck   the transmission failed again   i was driving one day and the car started jerking   then it rode ok after i put some transmission fluid in it   but it wouldn t change out of second gear   we had it overhauled and they couldn t believe the condition of the transmission   they thought it was the original transmission and thought the van had to at least have had over    miles   but their jaws dropped when we told them the transmission was less than a year old a few days after that   the engine started overheating   it would overheat momentarily and then suddenly it would go back to normal   in the end it was the head gasket   again   this time they said     my dad said forget it   we traded it in for a pontiac grand am after that   which is a great car   we love it   someone bought our van   by the way   for     didn t even get it off the lot   the engine locked up on them called our house shortly after we bought our new car   they said it was time for our    mile checkup on our van   my dad just shook his head and hung up on them br br  
232,0,  we purchased this van to provide adequate space for our family during travel   boy did we get more than we expected   this van has not only provided us with the space we needed but we also have so many options and luxuries   beginning with the outside of the van   we bought a   model the paint is in immaculate condition   looks brand new    two tone paint green and tan love the combination engine   clean   runs great   sounds and drives like brand new van   not bad for   years old   looks like this one may be worth the money interior   excellent   spacious   comfy seating with adequate leg room   not cramped   many options inside    ie   lumbar in front seats   adjustable seat belt height   heated outside mirrors   and lots of extra storage room   the inside is my favorite part   i just can not believe how nice this van is my overall opinion is   spend the money and purchase this van   it is well worth every cent   i love mine and when the time comes to retire it i will surly purchase another windstar br br  
233,0,  owners of the   windstar should be aware that the    liter engine is very prone to early head gasket failure and will not reimburse owners if the mileage exceeds    miles   customer service is virtually impossible to obtain and dealer service is generally below average for windstar problem areas   high failure areas on the windstar   in addition to the head gasket   are the electronics   sensors and rear brakes   a class action lawsuit was filed against motors on behalf of   windstar owners with defective head gaskets by a chicago law firm on december      if you wish to join the lawsuit   e mail your request to lawyers mylawyers their website is mylawyers also notify the national highway transportation safety board at      please notify nhtsb because if enough pressure is brought to bear on   they may   quot do the right thing quot   and reimburse owners for the defective head gaskets br br  
234,0,  please do not buy a windstar there are large numbers of owners experiencing mechanical problems with the s   l head gasket engine   including sable taurus   etc   you are welcome to read my earlier windstar review on june      in addition to the computer   brakes and head gasket   the windstar transmission is being mentioned more frequently on the net as a problem area   i bought a   windstar new and like the roominess   comfort and safety rating   however   the honda odyssey toyota sienna is just as safe   slightly smaller   more quiet inside   and much more reliable   please do not take my word for it   simply go to the net and read the information yourself before buying a windstar   start with the national highway transportation safety administrations consumer complaints   nhtsa dot gov cars problems complain others include home att net eccatanese fordmanx htm and lemonaidcars home htm and home att net eccatanese mainx htm please read these windstar horror stories before you purchase one   also   i request that you spread the word to family and friends asap as to the location of these websites   my dealer refused to provide the name or number of the district service rep   next i tried the consumer help line waste of time and totally useless since they are not empowered to offer financial assistance   only the district service rep can do that welcome to s catch      
235,0,  this van is great for families who have several kids with lots of friends   it is safe and comfortable   but it has had many major reliability problems over the past years   and has not been driven that much   seriously investigate reliability before purchasing   the options you have to buy to make this a decent car   power windows   locks   make the price uneccisarily high   overall   i would not purchase this vehicle without some kind of statement guarantee additional insurance from   but i must say   this van has tons of cargo room and seating comfort   especially with the captain seating option   we bought this vehicle to haul seven people around town   but we have used it for schelpping ping pong tables   trampolines   and more     
236,0,  when we found out about our rd pregnancy   we also found out that our nice explorer had to go   why   because our rd pregnancy was resulting in our rd and th children yep   twins   we looked at several used models and finally settled on a   windstar gl   it had less than    miles on it and had been a rental model for the dealership so we felt fairly confident it had been serviced properly   but alas   this was not to be   during the time we owned our windstar   it came under various recalls   each time we took it in   it wouldn t be properly repaired and the recalled item would have caused more damage to the engine that would not be covered   resulting in money out of our pocket   it drove fairly well more like a car than a van   but the steering ratio was horrid   although we were told the van was the   quot largest among the minivan class quot   we soon discovered this was not interior space   as our kids grew   the van became smaller and smaller   an adult could not comfortably squeeze into the rd row seat at all   door latches broke   power windows malfunctioned   cassette player stopped working   and that was in   years of ownership   in fact   our windstar was traded in for our new grand caravan while in the shop for yet another repair   says its improved the windstar   i hope for the sake of consumers out there putting their trust in them   they have   as for me   once bitten   twice shy br br  
237,0,  dear   reader   i regret to inform you that has the worst minivans in the world   i bought a   windstar and since   months after i bought it air conditioner problems arrive   a faulty clutch in the a c didn t allow the a c to run so my engine will keep every   minutes going up and down in the rpm   not to mention my major overheating during a   mile trip to church   during that trip i got so mad that i went to church and drove back home with a white smoked cloud and the temp gauge in the h   at the end a head gasket problem   water pump   and a catalytic converter full of   antifreeze coolant   try to beat that one   my tires lack of pressure all the time and aligment is done every    miles   fuel economy is actually called fuel waste   mpg in my windstar   the bench are lb each and the rear vent windows don t open anymore   my plastic headlights cover turn in to a crack yellow color and the windshield washer work when it wasn t to   i am waiting to finish paying for it so i could just put it in front of a railroad track and see it blow   probably with the star rating on accident i will need to put it two or tree times on the tracks   i almost forgot my sliding door don t close completely   if you look from the back you can see it slightly open   i don t even mention recalls letter   in total  
238,0,  i bought the   windstar due to our   year old daughter and our future children   my husband and i previously owned a caravan we loved   we found the windstar for a great price     with    miles lots of miles but looked in good condition   the van was great for the first   months then it got crazy   first trouble with the air which turned out to be the computer     then it started overheating   we checked the thermostat no problem   on the way back from the beach we blew the head gaskets     and now the transmission is acting iffy   and at this point we have so much money invested in the car we can t sell so we are stuck driving it until it dies   we had read consumer reports before we bought the van and it checked out   unfortunately we didn t wait long enough because now it s coming out that it s a lemon   so buyer beware br br  
239,0,  i am an extremely unhappy owner of a   poc windstar w k miles   i am posting this so that potential windstar owners know what to expect a few thousand miles down the road   it was a fight to get reimbursed for my blown head gaskets back at k miles   there is constantly something wrong with this car from electrical problems to ac problems   to electrical door lock problems    to chimes and warning lights always going off   i religiously maintain this car   following the recommended maintenance to the   quot t quot   one month after my k maintenance in which they reportedly   quot inspect the engine cooling system quot   the poc left me stranded with a blown front cover gasket and a failed water pump   the repair shop told me the warning signs should have been visible during the   quot inspection quot   i have performed extensive research on windstar problems and know my situation is not isolated   both dealerships in the charlton   sc area   jones and palmetto have lousy service departments and just give me the run around when i bring these issues up   so beware potential windstar owners   claims to have fixed the problem   but do you want to take the chance   don t believe all the hype   our   honda is running like an old reliable clock at k with only routine maintenance   no equipment failures on the honda and i hear the same thing from many honda owners br br  
240,0,  having been a worshipper for many years   i have finally   quot de sourced quot   as a supplier for my family cars   dating back to to the late   s   i had not purchased anything but products   from a taurus wagon to two escorts and two explorers   products were   in my opinion   the best quality cars suv s on the market   lately though i have changed my mind   yesterday i received my second recall letter in less than six months everyone has heard of the firestone fiasco   today s recall concerns the suspension system   and over the years i have had a huge amount of trouble with the   wheel drive system   the new focus has been out for less than a year and has had   recalls already   what s going on   since my is a supplier to the automotive industry   i can only assume that will be going steadily downhill   for the past   or so years   to boost their profits   they have demanded from all suppliers a    per year reduction in price   their q program is supposed to reduce costs such as waste   and inefficiencies to allow the supplier to pass along the savings   how many years in a row can you reduce your price and not cut back   could you work for    a year less every year   sooner or later you would need to cut back some critical area affecting your quality of life   well the same is true with suppliers   you can only go so far   some suppliers have redesigned their product so they can sell a cheaper product    note   my supplies a non critical item   my guess is that they are cutting corners in quality which passes the initial testing but is failing in the long run   the blowouts involving firestone were mainly on original equipment tires   not the aftermarket   i no longer trust or their products   they are our worst customer i will no longer buy a vehicle br br  
241,0,  we own a   explorer with the eddie bauer package   it s a great looking vehicle   all the comforts you d want   leather seats   lumbar   electronic everything   the most expensive component was the a c   it eventually started getting warmer and warmer and this year we took it in to be charged   well   that model already used r    but charges a fortune for it   plus that had to   fix   the leak   where ever that was   a truck that s   years old didn t just spring a leak   they could have charged it up and it would have lasted another   years   but instead   they   fixed it   and the bill was     then a week later   when it finally got warm enough to use the a c   i tried it and the car died at   miles per hour   i had to steer up a hill and off the road   the compressor went out   after the first use   so back the the repair shop and    later we had a c   for two weeks   then it quit being cold   we took it back and their new compressor had gone out   but i made them pay for repair   another big headache was the four wheel drive   i need the four wheel drive daily because i live atop a large   rocky hill   you push the button and the light comes on and you go up the hill   well eventually it got harder and harder to climb and then you d have to romp up it in order to get home   well   after spending    in tires in one year   i took it in   the dealer told me they just get old and lose their power   well i wasn t exactly convinced   i jacked it up and there was no power at all   i took it to a mechanic and he found the automatic hubs to be bad   well   with the explorer   you have to get them from   no aftermarket available   so for    a tire i got my wd back   my last chevy cost me    for a pair of hubs from warn and i was back on the road   but it cost over    to get the explorer working again   the vehicle has plenty of great featurs and it s comfortable   but the modern technology comes at a great price as it ages  
242,0,  i purchased this vehicle in   as it was coming off a lease   the mileage was low   and the body was in great condition   and when i drove it there were no problems   since purchasing it though   we have had quite a few problems   brakes went early   and of course you all have heard about the tire recalls   we also had to replace the front stabilizer bar several times   this was another recall   but as a second owner   we didn t hear about it   and had to pay for it ourselves   finally   our transmission died with still low mileage on the vehicle   doing some research online   i found that this problem has happened to thousands of owners   and that is aware of the problem   but is unwilling to help with costs   or to even address the issue   see this website for an example   carlounge cgi carsbbs read php f   i   t    i decided to trade my car in   since the cost to repair or replace the transmission was estimated at      i didn t get a whole lot for it   certainly not blue book value   since dealers are having a hard time reselling fords   i now have a used infiniti qx that has a   year     full warranty   can t beat that  
243,0,  before i bought my    escort pony now gone   and in its place a    sunfire gt   i owned a   escort pony   while not as refined as its successor    models and later   the   escort did have some good features considering the price   in   the escorts that were sold in america came with   engines   a standard    liter cfi   central fuel injection   that produced   horsepower at    rpm   and   lb ft of torque   a     hp   efi   efficient fuel injection   engine is available for this year   only in the escort gt i driving impressions i   my escort pony came equipped with the   hp cfi engine which gave this car   almost   adequate   performance   for hill climbing   but was shy of having enough power in high gear to make it up hills without lugging down   the   horsepower is reached at a fairly low rpm   so off the line acceleration is not too bad   but this car obviously was not made for burning rubber   the   speed is fairly low geared   i do not know the final drive ratio   however it s low enough so you can hear the    liter engine straining at highway speeds   the   speed manual also was not accommodating in town   as it would sometimes decide it did not want to shift into a certain gear at any certain time   cruising on the highway   besides being noisy   is also bumpy   and aggravating   the suspension is unforgiving   and lets you know when you have hit a small bump   or even when passing over reflectors on the road   a hard jolt can be felt   handling is inadequate   significant roll can be felt   and without power steering in the   pony   models   you better have some muscular arms    note b   many options are available on other models   this review is based on a   escort pony   the   escort rides on a small     wheelbase   and has an overall length of     the   suspension   consists of macpherson struts up front with coil springs   and the same treatment in the rear i interior accommodation i   the   interior   of the pony is plain   and as basic as it gets   the dashboard is downright dated   and so is the rest of the interior   my pony came with no options whatsoever   not even a stereo   manual windows   and doors were a way of life   arm rests on the drivers doors were of cheap plastic   but had fallen off after a few years of ownership   the drivers seat was not comfortable   and offered minimum support   the same can be said for the rest of the seats in this car   there is adequate room up front for small adults   but even the front is cramped   the rear was apparently made for children only   my escort pony was a   door coupe   so getting people in and out of this small car was a real pain   especially since the passenger seats would not fold forward all the way   vision is limited   with the claustrophobic feeling cabin   and limited visibility   driving this car was no picnic    exterior innovation i   the   exterior   matches the interior perfectly   they are both plain   boxy   and offer a dated design   this car isn t going to turn any heads   except those who have joined the escort following cult   the escort   which was given a face lift in   does look a tad more sophisticated than its predecessor   but still lacks modern styling   even back in   this car was looked at as a dated design   in late    as a    model   the escort got a major face lift and interior engine changes which made its successor much more desirable    note b   the   escort is offered in either a   door hatchback or   door hatchback    price    reliability   an escort pony in   with no options would run you around    dollars   and    dollars for models like the lx   today with poor resale   almost all models of the   escort can be had for less than      i have seen them in papers for as low as     with claims like    runs great   as for reliability   my pony was a real nightmare   problems included   worn cv joints    torn boots   tears in the   pleather   trimmed doors   shifting problems   a multitude of interior leaks   oil leaks   hatch struts went out   faulty gauges   overheating   drivers window would not roll up all the way   and rust was found in the fuel lines   all this   by the way   happened in less than   years of ownership   the car had less than    miles on it i final thoughts i a cheap car at a cheap price   the pony is only recommended as a last resort and if you can get a extremely good deal on one   if not the   escort should be avoided happy car shopping
244,0,   a little bit about me first b   i have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic   interior   power   warranty   options   etc   points of view   i believe an important   but always neglected area   though is from a steering and suspension system point of view   and let me tell you   most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area   you can find some very well engineered and built suspensions these days   but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience   and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision   after reading my reviews   read some on other aspects of the car you re looking for from the experts here at epinions   and make your choice b now on to the escort b   this is about the older escort   the whole car including the steering and suspension system got a total re design for the   model year   it was then that the car was based on the mazda   when and mazda had somewhat of a merger   so this opinion is for the pre   models   having the constitution of the united states on my side is a very good thing   because there is not one redeeming quality about the suspension of the escort   and if they could the and it s engineers would sue me for writing this   first off nothing is greasable on the escort   and the tie rods   both inner and outer wear out at a rapid rate   as do the lower ball joints   the design of the suspension is such that there is quite an angle from where the inner tie rods screw onto the steering rack   down to the steering knuckle   and this angle dictates that there will be a small contact area where the ball on the rack end of the inner tie rod contacts the bearing surface   the smaller the area the faster it will wear   that s just basic physics   and that is exactly what happens   if the engineers designed it where the inner tie rods were more horizontally mounted   there would be more surface area contacted and it would not wear as rapidly   but now it s too late   they are committed to mass production   even when you replace the factory unit with an after market part   the name s still the same   rapid wear   the lower ball joints are another sore spot   not greasable and prone to rapid wear   the ball joints on this car are integrated into the complete control arm   so when the ball joint portion wears you have to replace the complete lower control arm   this includes both the bushing on the strut rod   and the inner pivot bushing   this could really be a good thing though   because you will get new bushings when you replace the ball joint   but if you don t need bushings you have no choice   and at over    each retail   it is an expensive repair to replace both sides   there are many problems with other portions of the suspension on the escort too   like strut mounts and bearings   but suffice it to say i am not at all recommending any of you to consider a used older escort   it just isn t worth it   even if you got one really cheap   and got all of the front end parts replaced with lifetime warranty after market parts   they will wear out due to extreme angles of operation   and even though the parts would be covered with proof of purchase   and receipt from the garage you got it done at   the labor would have to be covered by you and the hassle of another trip to the garage and being without your vehicle is enough to shy you away from one the newer style escort s are a completely different story   they are basically   like mentioned above mazda   s   and are miles apart from the older models in quality   the only real problem with the re designed escorts are the outer tie rod ends like the older ones are not greasable   and will wear out rapidly   if you are considering an escort from   and newer   it is a much wiser and acceptable decision   and you should be pleased with this model br br  
245,0,  thankfully i do not own this car   because if i did i would curse myself everyday for making such a terrible decision much as my boyfriend does   he bought this car nearly two years ago   i told him then not to buy it   and i still tell him now what a terrible deal it really was   i have had the misfortune   perhaps fortune since i will never have to deal with such an experience from this particular car   of being present and experiencing every single one of this cars downfalls since the day he bought it   sometimes i even have to drive it myself when i am nice enough to let him borrow my wonderful honda civic for starters this car looks horrible form the outside   i have never been able to get over where the side view mirrors are placed   it looks absolutely ridiculous   to have them sticking out right in the middle of the front door rather than at the front like most cars   it is also very boxy in shape and is very high off the ground   the inside is not much better   there is hardly any interior room   and as unimportant as it is the controls are tacky and poorly placed this car has cost my boyfriend almost as much as he paid for it in repairs   and there is seriously always something wrong with it   things he can t afford to fix   he has to replace the transmission   the struts are crap and he severely needs new ones   it is so bad that you get a headache from all the bumps and vibrations   there were serious problems with the steering when he first got it that needed to be fixed immediately   it had alternator problems   and the list goes on   there have been so many repairs it s hard to keep track   many repairs can be expected with a used car but this is ridiculous   however   the biggest problem with the car is not all the maintenance it needed and still needs   although that certainly doesn t help   it is how terribly this car handles   the shifting is terrible and even though this car needs a new transmission we were told that is always will shift poorly   it accelerates slowly and seemingly has no power   perhaps the only good thing about this car is the fact that it is reasonable on gas   not great    but not horrible either i definitely would not recommend this car   it is known as a lemon among most people   if however   you do decide to purchase an escort i would seriously recommend getting it looked at by a mechanic to assess the cost of repairs before you buy it   so far you re probably thinking i m unreasonable in my assessment   but consider this   the car only had   miles on it when he bought it  
246,0,  well   i don t exactly own this car   but i have driven in it plenty of times over the last few years   it is my neighbor s car and we used to go many places in it until i got my corsica   this review is on a   escort lx   door hb   things that went wrong this vehicle has only    miles on it but yet is breaks like it has    miles on it   this car needs one significant repair at least once every two months   sometimes more   from what i can remember   these things went wrong both door armrests and handles   inside   have fallen off the ignition system needed replaced radio died a c died the headlights broke   electrical   and cost well over    to fix washer fluid pump oil leaked and needed fixed water pump died map lights stayed on and would not turn off which drained the battery clock won t work right engine had some problems auto trans is going to go bye bye soon brakes wear out fast and there have been many more problems that i don t want to bore you with now   back to the review interior exterior the exterior is nothing special   however   the back end is quite nice looking   the wheel caps are nice too   the front end looks big and old with the large     s volvo like headlights   the interior is small and very cramped   the back seat cushion is tilted funny which makes it uncomfy   there is little leg room in all four seats the rear two seats have a lap belt with a separate shoulder harness   they each have their own buckle   there are coin holders below the shift lever and in the locking glove box   they add a nice touch   you have to be small to drive this car   tilt wheel   what tilt wheel   this car doesn t have one   to me   a tilt wheel is a must   the seats are high off the floor and the lower cushions are thick   the sun visors are very nice and have a covered mirror with lights   this is a plus   under the hood under the hood of the lx   you will find a weak   l four cyl   engine   the brake oil washer fluid   and coolant fluids are easy to fill and find   the transmission and the power steering dipsticks are not even labeled   she had to go to sears and ask a worker which was which   there is a light under there so you can see at night please be sure to be very careful when buying this car   if you aren t rich   then don t buy it            fyi   my neighbor bought a brand new   escort and sold it within a year because it was always in the shop                        johna s own ratings    low       high power   front seats   back seat   trunk   brakes   reliability   room space   overall    but due to reliability   i have to give it only    sad stars  
247,0,   the product the   escort lx   the sporty version   is a four door with hatchback model that i have owned for the last year     i have driven approximately   miles on it   this is due solely to the fact that there are parts missing from the transmission   i believe this is due to somewhat poor maintenance on the part of the previous owners and second due to that the transaxle on this model   down to the lx   is considered crap   try auctioning for a   escort on ebay   if they list the cars faults   it ll be   busted transaxle   on there for sure the experience i may be the only person alive that was excited to get an escort   i paid for it all by myself   cash   we were aware it had a   slow shift   but had no idea how long it was going to be before the car was a goner i ll tell you the exact expiration date   june th     i was driving along on kingston pike in knoxville   tn when i heard a fire engine   i glanced in my rearview mirror   and the guy in front of me   who i left   well   over two car lengths between   stops with such speed   must be nice to have anti lock brakes a feature my escort didn t have   that i slam on my brakes and my brakes lock and i smash into him we patched up the car   we named her doo wop   as she had never bebopped in her entire year career as an automobile the car started having more trouble after we patched her up   the transmission fluid tube that runs from the resevior to the transaxle came off on the interstate and i had to exit with my lurching car to the nearest service station   the muffler fell off i bet it would have worked better if it were younger  
248,0,  this was the worst car i have ever owned   literally as the odometer rolled past     the fuel pump   tranmission   distributor cap   spark plug wires   cv axles   both   all went out   sure you are thinking this idiot never even changed the oil   wrong i know the importance of routine maintenance   this car couldn t hold up to regualr weart and tear   this must be why the odometer has only   dgits on it it won t make it to six   i know the car was never intended to be built like a tank that s why it costs as little as it does   however everything is made of cheap plastic   lacking any quality and value to the owner   also if you are even near   feet tall you will not fit in this car   front or back seat  
249,0,  i bought this   van to fit my family of   into   i loved it at first   then things began to go wrong   i have owned it for   months and in that time   the starter   the wiper   and heater have gone out   i am also experiencing some larger engine troubles but i realize that mine was probably the product of someone before me not taking very great care of it   besides the obvious mechanical problems nearly every screw has backed out and everything wiggles and giggles and rattles   you tighten it   it loosens   there is also a stationary seatbelt in the middle seat which has injured several people getting into the van   when i replaced the wiper i noticed the one i took out was a refurbed one which meant this was the third possible wiper on this car   otherwise it has been great   it totes the whole lot of us around safely   it does magnificent in the snow   is very roomy   the back seat is a little awkward to get into   it is very easy to drive and seems to be pretty powerful   gets decent mileage around   miles a gallon it has never left me on the side of the road   and it has tons of space to take everything that everyone wants to bring  
250,0,  i own a   it is a love hate relationship   this truck has never failed to start   on the other hand   i have had myriad mechanical difficulties with it   small things   like wires   fuses   and that damn check engine light that comes on at    miles even if there s nothing wrong   also   it gets pretty awful gas mileage   but it wasn t overly expensive   for a truck   and it s great being able to haul any kind of stuff   overall   i would say that i do not regret buying and owning it   but it has provided me with a few headaches   just remember if you get one   that if your check engine light comes on at    miles   you may not need to pay for pricy repairs br br  
251,0,  why do i dislike the   i purchased a   super cab   things were great until i reached   miles    miles over the warranty   my master air flow valve went   my driver side seat started falling apart   my door ajar light stays on   my air bag light on the dash board stays on   well the master air flow valve cost me      i am still fighting about the rest   when i asked the dealership about the air flow problem they told me that this should not have gone   when i contacted s customer service all i received was   promises that either the dealerships manager would call or the regional sales manager would call   well that was in november of   and still no call   trust me do not purchase a   in my eyes they are not worth the problems   i am looking for a manufacture who stands behind there product   perhaps a toyota   again please use extreme caution when buying from   quality is not job   at sincerely     
252,0,  this car is great the first couple of times you drive it but then the buyers remorse kicks in   i have owned this car for over   year first the good things   this car is fast and has good power throughout the power band   i really like the nine inch wide tires and supercharger and the car drives great on the highway now the bad things   too many to list   but i will try really cheap carpeting   no floor mats either aweful interior   very cheap s look and build quality leather quality is poor post antenna is an eyesore engine is very noisy   very audible engine ticking and clanking transmission gear noise   thumping sounds when shifting shifter is rubbery   and hard to find rd gear a good seating position relative to the shifter and steering is impossible to find body panels do not line up at all seating is below aceptable lots of body roll   when you drive it   it feels like it is going to tip over   but it does manage turns good regardless traction control doesn t work well   stalls out the car and causes wheel hop very antiquated headlamp technology have to bolt a license plate frame onto front   since bumper doesn t have it built in exhaust note does not sound aggressive enough rubber instead of polyurethane in much of the suspension manual hood prop plus   the premium svt service you are supposed to get when you buy a cobra is nonsense   i don t get any better service than someone who bought a taurus   still has not issued a recall on the ticking engines even though they know about the defect my first and last  
253,0,  my husband purchased a   probe used in    it already had    miles on it   unfortunately   my husband was blinded by the sporty car that he could actually afford   he was just starting his career at that time   there were problems from the start of his even considering this car on the lot   there was a newer model probe with less miles   obviously it cost more   well   my husband really liked this car   the salesman got him really interested in that car and offered for him to drive it off the lot on saturday night and come back monday to work out specifics   thankfully   my husband did not take up that offer   i should also mention my husband was in a hurry to get a car because his car had been stolen when he returned to the dealership the following monday   the same salesman told him that he couldn t afford the newer probe and had no memory of even offering it   since my husband had gotten his heart set on this car   he settled for the older probe   he got a pretty decent loan from credit and was paying about    month   he paid the blue book value for the car   within   months   things were going wrong   within   months   it became obvious that the previous owner had   quot worked quot   on the car   creating several problems   besides the regular payment   the probe was costing about    in repairs every   months   that s a lot of money   even though the car was sold qualifying under the lemon law   by the time there was enough problems to take action   the dealership was under new management and they supposedly could not do anything   was contacted   but by the time they responded   the dealership had dissolved the final straw came when the drivers side window broke   it wouldn t roll up all the way   the estimated cost to repair it was over     immediately   we started looking for another car   we pawned it off on an unsuspecting saturn dealership in tucson   who over valued the car   they told us they would auction it off for parts   so we didn t feel so bad   we were never happier to get rid of a car   we can not recommend a probe to anybody   especially because the probe model has been discontinued and you can only purchase it used at this time   our treatment from was also very poor   we won t be buying any cars in the future   please see my response to the   quot excuses quot   of why the problems of this car should have been expected in the comments section br br  
254,0,  well where to begin   i purchased the   aspire in    it was a great deal i paid   bucks for it and it only had    miles on it   it was my first car so of course i was in love with it that changed as the years went by first of all   the aspire is one of the ugliest cars you will ever see   it got to the point that i was embarrassed driving it   don t even try to put a spoiler on it that makes it worse   also my car was red when i bought it and orange   years later even with a fresh wax job it still looked orange   that s the outside of the car   the inside isn t much better   the fabric they used to make the seats was ripping when i purchased it if that tells you anything   wow   and it was so ugly   so if you like getting teased for the appearance of your car this is the car for you   my dad thought it would work well for either a go cart or a golf cart   and one time when the aspire was broken down   my father thought he could just go pick it up and put it in his trunk instead of spending the money to have it towed another downfall was the fact that the car didn t come equipped with anything well   except wheels   the   aspire does not have power steering   this is horrible especially if you are used to having it   i eventually got sort of used to it as my arm muscle started getting stronger   parking is almost impossible in tight spots unless you are hee man   the   aspire also does not have rear defrost this is nasty especially if you live in minnesota like i did   i felt like i was scrapping the inside of my windows more than the outside   some other features that the   aspire does not have are cd tape player   cruise   and air conditioning as my car started getting older i felt like there was always something wrong with it   i think i had oil leaks about   times   the brakes had to be fixed often   and the saddest of all was the time i hit a pot hole and the front wheel axle literally broke in half   i put more money into the car than i paid for it originally so needless to say   when i got in an accident with it   months ago   i was relieved to see it totaled   how embarrassing to get in an accident and have little orange pieces of plastic scattered around not to mention the styrofoam that was revealed underneath   r i p   aspire  
255,0,  i currently own an aspire and there are some good things about it and some bad things about it   one of the great things about this car is the mileage   i can fill it up and it will go forever   however this car really does not handle well   one gust of wind   and i am blown all over the road   i recently had a blow out going about   mph on the highway   the driving conditions were ideal   but i my car was thrown into the side railing of a bridge and the damage accrued from this simple blow out is going to be about    dollars   this estimate is the average from   body shops   when the blow out of my tire occurred i really did not realize how much damage the little bang had done until i tried to change the damaged tire   these cars are not made well   i would not call them safe cars because of the amount of damage i sustained from such a seemingly simple fender bender     
256,0,  makes many vehicles in all sorts of sizes to accommodate the needs of its customers   some are large and heavy and drain the gasoline faster than a reservoir following a dam burst   others are more economical and can really help stretch your fuel dollars to the fullest   one vehicle that fits into the latter category is the    focus    a smaller vehicle designed with economy in mind    features options b focus comes in several different body styles   hatchback   sedan   and wagon   this review will center on the sedan style   with the sedan   you can choose among three different trim levels   lx   se   and zts   these three trim levels are arranged in order of price and overall luxury   with the lx being the most basic   the zts the most luxurious   and the se falling somewhere in the middle of the two   each of these three trim levels seats five and comes with a standard option package that includes most of the usual bells and whistles that one expects nowadays   tilt steering wheel   automatic transmission   manual is an option   front air bags   power windows and locks    year     mile warranty   cd player   etc   there are also a few unique options that are standard with the focus   like child safety locks   along with optional features like leather   heated seats   heated mirrors   and audiophile sound system   fuel economy is very good with this model from   the lx and se models both have mileage ratings of     the zts rates slightly lower   with     this is due to the somewhat larger   more powerful engine in the zts   a    liter zetec engine with   horsepower   the other two models have an spi engine with only   horsepower   all three models are available only with   cylinder engines b price b focus will appeal to many people for one simple reason   the low price   the invoice price on the three models is approx      for the lx      for the se   and     for the zts   adding options will   of course   increase the price by a couple thousand or more   but the overall cost is still low when compared to the average vehicle    final thoughts b   the   focus sedan is a simple vehicle with a few nice features combined with some real annoyances   let s talk first about the good points   besides the low price   this vehicle does offer a reliable   responsive steering system that makes turning a breeze   braking is quick and reliable and there is very little vibration or noise   even at high speeds   the price is low   too   and the smaller engine equates to greater fuel efficiency cargo space is also very good with the focus   the trunk contains about    cubic feet of usable storage area   and this can be increased with the fold   down rear seats   the large trunk was one of the first things that caught my attention when i first examined this vehicle   i m always looking for additional storage space   and a large trunk is an important consideration when i m judging the merits of a car   now   let s talk about the negative aspects of the   focus sedan   first of all   i got really annoyed with the seat belt beeper   this is a safety reminder that is becoming more and more common in newer models of cars   it beeps at you until the driver gives in and fastens the seat belt   seat belts are a good idea   of course   but it gets really irritating listening to that beep   another annoying sound is the turn signals   they make this awful tic   toc sound   similar to what you hear with a wind   up clock   i didn t think the comfort was all that good in this vehicle either   from the driver s seat   i felt a little bit tight   even after adjusting the seat backward   i felt like i was too close to the wheel   this vehicle can not be recommended for very tall people   i can t imagine how an individual over   say      could fit themselves comfortably into this small space   probably the greatest strike against focus however is the weak acceleration   the   horsepower engine in the lx and se trim levels operates with a single overhead cam and two valves per cylinder   this provides enough power for easy driving in the city   but once it comes time to accelerate quickly   the focus has a difficult time gaining ground   this is especially true when the air conditioner is running   i often found that   to pick up sufficient speed when entering the ramp of an interstate highway   i was forced to temporarily turn the a c off   i m afraid that   horsepower just doesn t cut it when it comes to quick get up and go   the zts trim has a little more power    horsepower   but not by much   i didn t drive the zts   but i doubt that the additional power of   horses would make a significant difference   of the three sedan trim levels   the zts is a little more sporty and it offers the most options   but the focus overall is not a very fun vehicle   i have read many reviews of the focus that try to hype it up and make it sound like a enjoyable car for young people   but i fail to see their point   it might free up some cash flow   because the price is so low   to spend on other things   but the fun   with focus   ends right there   my bottom line on this vehicle is that it s a very basic   simple   practical car for money   conscious consumers   with an invoice price range from     to        to     retail   the   focus sedan will likely remain a popular choice for millions of americans who are sick and tired of flushing so many dollars down the drain to make a car payment and to pay for fuel   for myself   i will stick with the more enjoyable vehicles that cost a little more and guzzle a little more gas   they might cause a greater feeling of lightness in my wallet but they are also more in tune with what i want in a vehicle and what i am willing to pay for   the   focus sedan is inexpensive   but it fails to excite or even to satisfy   unless your funds are tight   i recommend focusing on something a little more enjoyable  
257,0,  i recently had to rent a car to carry a bit more stuff than i could get on the back of my bike   harper rental   in hilo   hawai i   assigned me a   focus sedan with    miles on it   when i rode over to pick it up   and first saw the car   i thought    gee   that s kinda pretty   i won t mind driving that around   well   it was nice in the parking lot   i was very grateful for the nice water tight windows   and the heater air con   but once i had loaded my amp a fender accoustisonic jr   not terribly big or heavy   a couple of small drums   other percussion   and my costumes   i had to pretty much floor the gutless wonder to make the speed limit going up the volcano highway   this made me think it would probably be a lousy family car   unless you just tool around town and use it for grocery runs so it doesn t have to work very hard   mashing the accelerator to stay with traffic sucked the gas down   so i lost any fuel savings associated with such a lightweight car   acceleration was sluggish   so i was unable to pass any of the heavy equipment or horse trailers   which were averaging about   mph   this made me really wonder what it would have been like with four adults sitting in it   no idea what kind of engine was in it   but whatever it was   the exercise wheel could have used an extra mouse   or even an upgrade to a mouse or a gerbil   perhaps adding a rubber band auxiliary engine would have helped   hmmmmmm       guess i wasn t at all impressed with the powerplant   handling was pretty decent   though   on the return home   making the downhill run   the car had no problems staying with traffic   and handled quite well   nice and tight steering   excellent cornering capability   comfy seating   at     tall   when i stand up reeeeeaaaaalllly straight   i found the leg and head room to be fine   i did bump my head once when i was squirming around trying to adjust the seat   so my    sweetheart may not have been as comfy   while the trunk capacity was excellent   i found the high lip on the trunk painfully inconvenient   lifting all of my gear that high was very hard on my back and shoulders   i almost couldn t get the heavier stuff into the trunk   and getting it back out was worse   i did like how far forward the load can sit   so the tail doesn t overload and lighten the front end  
258,0,  my experience i test drove a   focus lx sedan at a local dealership   my test drive lasted about half an hour   and consisted of winding secondary roads and the freeway   performance the focus has many strengths   but straight line stomping is not among them   the engine in the lx model that i drove was among the weakest in the budget sedan brigade   putting out just   horsepower   although acceleration felt adequate around town   the focus felt decidedly flat footed on freeway on ramps   even when i wasn t pushing it   when i floored the throttle for maximum acceleration   the sensation was akin to driving through deep sand and the engine wasn t very quiet about it   either   most car magazines have quoted the lx s    times around   seconds   which isn t awful   but places it among the slowest brand new cars   to be fair   this relative lethargy is less pronounced in other focus trims that aren t all that much more expensive   for example   the se gets a   horsepower engine   along with a cd player and other useful niceties   for a little over     more   that trims the    time down to a more reasonable    seconds or so   and although i haven t driven a focus with this engine   it s likely to add a measure of confidence in freeway merging that the lx model was short on   transmission clutch the focus   transmission shifted well enough   but lacked a precise   mechanical feel that would have made it fun   the shifter finds the gears accurately i never missed a shift but it has long throws   and its action feels mushy   similarly   the clutch engaged very smoothly   making it nearly impossible to jerk the car during gearchanges   but it had a long throw and engaged way up at the top of the pedal travel   which made for lots of left leg aerobics when driving around town   steering handling the focus fares much better in this area   its road manners have a distinctly european feel to them which comes as no surprise when you consider that the focus was designed in part by of england   with the european market in mind   its steering was firmly weighted and responded quickly   with a solid   decisive feel that inspired great confidence on twisting roads   there was also an unusual amount of road feel coursing through the wheelrim   an unusual quality in a low priced car   and one that allowed me to intuitively judge how much grip was left when i was driving hard on a twisty road   the steering feels just a touch squirmy on center   but is otherwise second only to the mazda s for feel and precision   the focus s soft suspension allowed quite a lot of body lean in hard turns   which was unsettling at first   but once i learned to trust the focus s chassis   i found it a capable handler with plenty of grip in reserve on winding roads   two thumbs up for european driving priorities   and their positive effect on the focus s excellent dynamic qualities   ride another impressive quality of the focus is how well it rides   usually   agile handling cars make some noticeable sacrifice in ride comfort due to their stiff suspensions   but not the focus   its ride is quite soft and absorbent   soaking up bumps and ruts quietly and without harshness   damping is a bit on the soft side   meaning that the car bobbles over dips and humps in the road   but most of the time it simply swallows the bumps without disturbing passengers   as mentioned before   the engine isn t all that quiet   but road and wind noise are pleasantly muted   interior the focus s interior isn t perfect   but it competes very well with the best in class   there was a surprising amount of room inside   both front and rear   and space was especially generous overhead it felt like i could have worn a ten gallon hat while seated   if i was for some reason possessed to do so   all the focus s controls were easy to see and use   and while they didn t operate with the well oiled silkiness of the corolla s or civic s controls   they were easily superior to the crackly switchgear in other domestic alternatives like the chevy cavalier and neon   there has been a good deal of griping about the focus s front seats in the automotive press   but i found them plenty comfortable during my test drive   and while the high   upright driving position wasn t to my liking   i can imagine many buyers would love the commanding   minivan like view of the road it provides   there were only two notable caveats in the focus s cabin   one was the materials   which were predominantly cheap   hard plastic   detracting from the sense of quality   the other was the distracting styling of the dashboard   where numerous slashing curves and unusual angles competed with the road for my attention during my test drive   practicality i ve already mentioned the expansive interior   but it s worth mentioning again as it adds a considerable measure of practicality to the focus from the inside   it feels like a much bigger car   the trunk is also quite spacious for a small car   and a standard split folding rear seat makes it all the more flexible   for further utility   buyers can choose from a five door hatchback style   the zx   or a conventional station wagon   while i haven t driven either of these models   their behavior should be identical to that of the sedans   while adding a measure of cargo hauling ability and uniqueness   reliability ah   here s the rub   the focus is quite a good little car   but according to consumer reports   its reliability is much worse than average a fairly scathing criticism   and while this is purely anecdotal evidence and far from conclusive   one of my friends who bought a focus recently would certainly agree with cr s findings his water pump broke twice in one week   stranding him out of town for days   overall so frustrating i really liked this car in nearly every respect   and yet i can t give it my recommendation   although it s a fresh   modern design   and its road manners are fun and engaging   its very poor repair record was more than enough to temper my enthusiasm   and i simply can t give the focus the nod with a clear conscience   as good as this car is   there are others   like the civic and corolla   that drive just as nicely and aren t nearly as likely to give you problems   a new car should give its driver total peace of mind   and that s something the focus may not be able to deliver  
259,0,  i own a   eddie bauer explorer   the car is nice   has all the whistles and bells that someone could want   and it rides decently   but within the first year of ownership   i have had numerous little problems   that have turned out to be major inconveniences   the rear windshield wiper would not work properly   the door locks didn t work   warning lights come on for no reason and the dealer has   to this day   been unable to find the cause   what s worse is dealing with and their dealers   oh   they do an absolutely great job with customer service   always promising that they will do whatever they can   apologizing for all the frustration   etc   in fact   i would say they have the best trained customer service departments i have seen anywhere   however   its one thing to be nice and say all the right things on the phone   but its another thing to be able to actually resolve the problem   their cars have so many little things that go wrong   and its surprising how ineffective they are in fixing them i would estimate that in the first year of ownership   i have actually only had the car   months   it has been in the shop for at least   months of ownership   little stuff   big stuff   it doesn t matter   this car has the problems

261,0,  the econoline van was not only a mechanics worst nightmare but also the owners   this van had numerous problems including severe break problems and an overall rough ride from light suspension   the brakes had to be replaced at least every four months and the suspension seamed to always   quot bottom out quot   and not provide enough suspension for even the regular trip around town   sure this van was nice for carrying people and cargo but mechanical problems put this van on the bottom of my list   so if your looking for a van out there i believe that you should shop around some more and definatly not look in to the econoline van unless your up for a rough ride and spending money on brakes every four months   i really do not recommend this van to anyone   the ride was horrible   it got about ten miles to the gallon on gas   and used up your money in many other ways br br  
262,0,  my   probe se was a gift to me   and the buyer got a great deal on it   at least that s what i thought at first    appearance   the probe is a great looking car   some say it looks like an artificial sports car   but with the sleek styling and flip up headlights   it s got a very sporty look   it even had a small rear spoiler   which added to the sportiness   the shape of the probe makes its length a little longer than i tend to like   it s difficult to park the car a lot of the time   the strangest thing about the probe are the windows   there is no frame around the windows   and the doors are sealed with a rubber molding around the door frame   the problem with this is that it makes it noisy   outside wind is easily heard   and easy to break into   all it takes is prying the window slightly and then using a wire hanger to unlock the door   my car was broken into and   cleaned out   much to my dismay the interior looks great   and the seats are similar to the bucket seats you see in many sports cars   the material and workmanship of the interior seems top notch   the rear seats are not roomy   and passengers in the back seat will often bump their heads on the rear window b features   my probe se had some great features   including excellent a c   great pick up and handling   and a decent sound system   it is versatile for a sports car   since it is a hatchback   it allows you to fit a lot of things inside   although the sporty styling means less vertical space for transport    ride   the car is a front wheel drive   and handles very well in the winter   it accelerates quickly   and handles very responsively   at times the ride can be a little rough   especially when going over bumps and potholes   but overall it handles like a dream   the automatic transmission makes for quick starts   and the shifting has a sporty feel   the rpms will run high   then quickly shift to give the quickest acceleration   despite the fast acceleration   it gets great gas mileage   i usually got   or more miles per gallon on the highway my chief complaint about the ride is the noise   as mentioned before   the windows are sealed with rubber molding but no frame   this means that wind noise can be heard through the window and rain can easily leak in   sometimes   in fact   the window would roll down on its own   the engine also rattles and squeaks a lot b reliability   here is the probe s weakest point   reliability   about two days after i got the probe   the engine stalled while i was in chicago traffic   it started again   but then after i stopped for gas i couldn t get it started   after having it towed i found out it was a bad connection between the battery and the engine   and cost    to fix   little did i know that repairs were going to be much   much more expensive later on during the two years i owned the car   i had to replace the oxygen sensors twice    each time this happened   i had to replace the catalytic converter    with installation   and have minor work on the transmission   about     after i had given up a few limbs to pay for repairs and had complete preventative maintenance done on it   i figured it would run for a while with no problems   in   months the   check engine   light went on for the rd time   i was told that the car needed a new catalytic converter   just replaced a year before   new oxygen sensors   just replaced   months before   and electrical work   all which would add up to     in the end   i decided to donate the car to charity   and bought myself another car   the gift would have cost me almost as much as the original amount paid   this car is great for people that don t mind frequent repairs   or those who are car enthusiasts who can do their own repair work   it looks cool   and it s so much fun to drive   even the automatic has power galore  
263,0,  i purchased a   probe in may of    it was brand new with only   miles on it when we got it   very clean   very sporty   it was my first new car purchase ever   i thought i had the perfect car   wrong   after only a month the a c went out   and in texas summers an a c is a given   we took it in and discovered that our dealer wouldn t give us a loaner   even though it was only a month old   eventually i got one anyway   the fixed the problem and we were on our way   a month went by and the same thing happened again   again we got it fixed   this continued to happen at least   times over the next year or so   on top of the a c problems the brakes wore out after    miles   the tires were shot around    miles   the seats tore up   and the gas mileage was so so   when you drive down the rode it seems as if you are in a wind tunnel or something   and when it rained outside it usually rained in on us   needless to say   after about    miles we traded it in just as the transmission was fixing to go out on it   by the way   to get a transmission fixed you have to fork out about   bucks   and that will be a normal cost for about every    miles after that   stay away from this and any other if you can br br  
264,0,  the excursion is the largest sport utility vehicle on the market   i would only recommend this vehicle if you really need to tow    pounds b exterior    like some suv s on the market   the excursion is based on a pickup truck   in this case it s the f    as far as styling goes   i would call it   functional   but nothing more b interior    the wide seats are very accommodating   power adjustable pedals are a nice feature   but i m a rather tall driver and thus have no use for them   there is a lot of head and leg room all throughout the front and nd row seats   even for me   although the excursion is not very aerodynamic   i feel it does a good job of keeping wind noise down to a minimum   not like a lexus though   my test car has the diesel engine   it idles pretty loudly   the optional reverse sensing system helps a lot because   usually   the bigger the car   err   suv   the bigger the blind spots   to me   an suv of this size should only be used for towing or hauling   however   luxury options such as leather upholstery   an entertainment system   a cd changer   and even automatic climate control is either standard or optional depending on the model b engine    there are gasoline engines available   but gas mileage with those engines are horrible   the diesel engine is a little more thriftier   the    liter powerstroke turbocharged v diesel engine produces   horsepower at    rpm   and a substantial   lb ft   of torque at an extremely low    rpm   this may sound like a lot of power   but in my opinion   the    pound suv needs that kind torque just get moving   this engine serves only   purposes   towing   and fuel economy   the diesel is more expensive to buy than the gasoline engines so take it for a test drive before you decide to buy one   all engines use the same   speed automatic transmission   i averaged    mpg in a mix of city and highway driving b handling    this is the excursion s weakest point due to its size   it s very ponderous on twisty roads   and has a huge turning circle   getting in and out of parking spaces is like a chore to me   i m surprised there is even a limo version of the excursion   the brakes feel strong   but it takes a bit longer to stop from speed than other   lighter    i m talking    pounds   sport utility vehicles b ride    small bumps are easily absorbed due to the   inch long wheelbase   hitting larger bumps   to me   can get annoying at times   despite being so large   the excursion feels very stable in a straight line b reliability    although nothing too serious has happened   for a while i was hearing a popping noise coming from under the floorboard   i have yet to figure out what it is   but i will update this review as soon as possible b value    despite its drawbacks   the excursion is a fairly good value   assuming you need the towing capacity   or room for   
265,0,  my wife and i lease a   xlt   she absolutely loves it   but i wish i could drive it off a cliff when we purchased the truck in february    it was a very sturdy truck   with power and comfort all together   however   after only    miles   it feels like it s falling apart at the seams   in ohio   the highways and biways are constantly cracking and getting potholes in them   the bumps on the roadways are enough to make an airsick person want to fly to get around   what has happened over the past few years with this truck   is that the suspension is not shot   the steering is over sensitive   it seems lighter around corners   and all in all it makes me very uncomfortable driving it around any vehicle that fish tails when it hits a little bump in the road while going around a gentle curve is not safe   my wife gets studs put on the rear tires for winter driving   but we have to put    bags of sand in the bed of the truck for the studs to make any difference whatsoever   we did not get an extended cab   so needless to say   the seats aren t as comfortable as possible   however   puts the seats so high up in the cab   that the roof seems too short   i am only     and i feel like i have to slouch to keep from hitting the ceiling the blind side is huge   this is because the rear window does not extend far enough to the side of the truck   to increase the peripheral vision the electrical system shorted out after only   year of driving it   for instance   if i want to turn the wipers on   i turn the knob   but have to wait for about    minutes for them to kick in   then   after i turn them off   i ll be driving down the road a little way   and the high speed wipers will just start going   and i can t stop them   i wasn t going to mention the fact that the washer fluid dispensers don t work either   you may ask   why didn t you take it to the shop to get it fixed   my answer   i did twice   they work for a couple weeks   or even a month   then   it starts happening again well   my wife loves it   that s why we still have it in the driveway   next february   when the lease has expired   it s bye bye

271,0,  we purchased a used    aspire   it looked great   for a small car   it s even roomy   we got the two door   what a mistake   it s family unfriendly if you have small children in car seats   getting small children in and out of the back is a pure nightmare in the making   you have to actually climb into the back seat to get them out   it s even tough to fit the carseat through the room you have between pushing the seat all the way up   you obviously can t put them in the front because of the air bags   this car is great on mileage   it s about the only plus to it   it s got no get up and go   my    tempo   which is ten years older   has more pick up and go than the aspire   you can put your foot to the floor on the gas but you ll find yourself saying a prayer when you try to merge on a freeway that you don t get hit because it takes you forever to reach traffic speed   there are only four seat belts in this car   unlike most cars   there are only two seat belts in the back   instead of three   why they didn t put one where there is obvious space for one   is a mystery   i get a work out just driving the car   power steering my foot   you have to put a little muscle into turning the wheel   the brakes make up for that   they are super touchy   if you aren t very light on the foot   you will get to meet the dash in a sudden fashion   i notice they tend to lock easily   my husband drives this car the most and my older   beat up car is my preference compared   the aspire might have air conditioning and a better stereo than my old tempo but having to drive the aspire just isn t worth the luxury of air and better speakers   this car would be great for a grandmother or your average   run of the mill   sunday driver   it s slow   obviously you need to not have small children with this car   it sure isn t child friendly for parents   i thought the hatchback would be nice with children   that was until i tried to fit a standard sized folded playpen into the back   that was difficult   very difficult   but finally accomplished   there is plenty of foot and leg room for such a small car but they sure didn t make the back storage area roomy   the seats do fold down in the back to make more room   that s wonderful unless you have children   in other words   if you need more room in the car to fit something in the back   i suppose you could strap the kids to the top of the car in their car seats   lol   although it is a funny image   of course that s not safe or legal   what was thinking when they made this car   obviously they weren t thinking about families   children   or their needs   i have dubbed the aspire the new and improved version of the pinto   i now know why there are so many used aspires for sale   the original owners got smart and bought something else br br  
272,0,  ok   so my title is sort of a rip off from a funny movie but when i think about the aspire i had   that title is stuck in my head   i bought a   aspire   i still can t tell you the exact color of it   it was a purple blue   it depended on the light outside or lack of   i should have been warned right there that maybe this car wasn t one to buy   even the dealership couldn t name that color   the price was affordable   it matched my budget on payments   i thought it was kind of small but since i drive a lot   i didn t mind because i knew i d save a lot on gas money reason one to hate this car is that it is small   while the seats in the back fold down to make more room if you want to carry something large   there really isn t that much space in the back   when the seats are up so you can have passengers in the back   the area in the back   this is a hatch back   no trunk   is very small   i discovered this after i tried to fit a few things in it after i bought it   there wasn t room   i couldn t fit a golf bag in it without it stick up   my wife couldn t fit the playpen   folded   in it   the large stroller we own for our child wouldn t fit   we usually had to put some of our groceries on the floor of the car because all of it wouldn t fit in the small back space   also   we had problems shutting the hatch back   sometimes it didn t want to shut   sometimes when i hit a dip in the road   the thing actually popped open   i was less than pleased reason number two to hate this car is the lack of power it has   while test driving it on surface streets you won t notice it   it handles surface streets great   it s when you get on a highway or freeway that you notice   you can put your foot to the floor trying to merge with traffic going over fifty miles and hour and still not reach that speed at a decent pace   i ve almost been in accidents because of this   the car just has no get up and go   reason number three to hate this car is the wheel is hard to turn when you are doing u turns yet the brakes are super touchy   you can barely put some weight on the brakes and they tend to almost lock up   this you can adjust to   which i did   but i wasn t real happy about it   the steering i also got used to but my wife refused to drive my car after a few times   she felt it was too hard to steer   while some might think the wife not wanting to drive their car is a reason to buy it   remember reason one and two reason number four to hate this car is that when you travel any distance in it   the car seems to shrink on you   while you might frown about this because we all know cars don t really shrink   i know that   it feels like it is   after an hour or so on the road you realize just how much of a compact car this is   the seats aren t real comfortable after an hour behind the wheel either   it doesn t bother you at first but after an hour   you start to feel it in your back and behind side   reason number five to hate this car is while traveling you really notice the flaws about this car   while driving in the mountains you are going to experience power loss on the way up   traffic will start passing you by even though you have your foot to the floor   there just isn t any power in this baby   while driving in the desert i noticed that the car doesn t do well in extreme heat either   you buy newer cars so you don t have to worry about them breaking down   i was worried in this car   reason number six to hate this car is that since i bought it i ve had to take it into the shop four times   i had to take it in the first time because the brakes needed work and they were new when i bought it   they lasted less than a year   i was told that they see aspires in often for this   the second reason i had to take it in was it was overheating   the third time i had to take it in was because while driving on the freeway i could hear a bad noise coming from the wheel well on the passenger side   i had to replace the front axal   it was cheaper than paying for a new joint and boot   which was the problem   the fourth time i had to take it in was because there was something wrong with the transmission   i could feel it slipping   reason number seven to hate this car was paying the huge bill that came with all four of those repair bills reason number seven to hate this car   and i blame this one one the dealership i bought it from   was the alarm that came with it   it was a cheap alarm system   it was the kind that locks the ignition so no one can drive away with it if they break into it   the alarm was a real piece of junk   someone could smash a window   steal everything in the car   and it wouldn t set the alarm off   one day my battery for my remote died and i could get into the car but i couldn t get it started   the alarm didn t even go off when i tried to start it   the system worked fine that way   the car wouldn t start   i had to call aaa thinking i d just have it towed home   borrow the wife s alarm remote   and go replace the battery in mine   when aaa showed up the guy just shook his head at me   popped open a panel under the dash   and pushed a button   the alarm shut off so the car started again   all anyone ever had to do was break a window   pop that panel to push a little button   rip out the ignition   and take off with my car in less than a minute   i was a bit furious over this fact reason number eight to hate this car is that it only comes with two seat belts in the back seat   there is room for a third one but must have really wanted to cut corners when they made it   there is about fourteen inches of space in the middle of the backseat that is totally a waste of space in that regard   would it have killed them to put in a middle seat belt   i guess so   they sure didn t do it   reason number nine is the total lack of comfort the car has and functions   mine was one of the better models made   i had air conditioning   it didn t work very well   the ashtray fell out or jammed up when i tried to use it for a change tray   the glove box is an actual glove box   that s about all that you can fit into the tiny thing   a pair of gloves   i wanted to upgrade the stereo system but realized that again they had really made this car compact   i had a hard time finding a unit that would fit in the very small space provided   when i did try to buy one and have it installed   the people just shook their heads at me and explained that they would have to do a lot of work to remove the factory installed unit and get a new system in   this adds to your normal bill   they assured me that the wiring was a nightmare as well   reason number ten is looking back at the other nine reasons and knowing that i paid too much money for this car   regretting buying it in the first place   and having to go out to find another car   i no longer have the aspire   i couldn t wait to be rid of it after having it for just over a year   i also want to mention that the trade in value of the car is painful   it sure hurt me realizing exactly how much having that piece of junk for a year had cost me after they deducted what i d paid on it to that point   deducting the trade in value   and adding that remaining balance to my replacement car   it was a costly mistake that i made buying it   i don t recommend this car to anyone unless you feel like buying a car for someone you don t like who you feel needs one headache after another and a sore backside after a long road trip   maybe i should have given it to my mother in law   lol   just kidding   i can t think of anyone that i don t like enough to wish that car on   i have always loved fords   i bought another   it s just that made a mistake in producing the aspire   it s the pinto of the   s     
273,0,  although my   automatic aspire runs well   has decent pickup for a smaller car   and gets great gas mileage   i have been unfortunate to have had to replace the transmission   times and the transmission just went out again   so will be a rd time   the first time   at k   honored the warranty   but the second time   even though it only had k on the transmission   there was k on the engine   so would not honor the original rebuilt or the extended warranty purchased with the car   as the transmission was rebuilt by a third party this last time   they are going to honor their work and cover the transmission   but if left up to   i would have to pay again   so this economy car is costing more than that
274,0,  i had purchased a   contour sport new from a dealership expecting it to be a good trouble free family car   the day after i bought it   i had found the spare wheel and jack missing   the dealership had taken one out of another contour   a few months later   when the rain started coming down   i found that i had two inches of rain in the trunk   i took to the dealership and a week later in the shop they had fixed the leaks   about a month later the brakes started squeaking when backing up   it was loud   they had told me the parking brake cables were sticking and had worn out the rear break pads   so they had replaced the cables   replaced the brake pads and machined the rotors due to wear   the noise had stopped and the car ran good until the check engine light came on   i took it back to the dealership and they hooked it up to the diagnostic and found all kinds of problems with it   so they put me in a rental car until they can get the parts they needed to fix it   the car was under warranty so nothing came out of my pocket and the people were nice   about twenty miles over my warranty my coolant light came on   i checked the coolant and it was at its normal level   i called the dealership and told them the problem and they said it was probably a faulty switch and the warranty had expired   i told them all the troubles i had with it   but they didn t seem to care   a week later my brakes did the same thing when i had bought it new   i called the dealership and told them the problem had not been fixed since this was the same thing that happened the first time   all they could tell me is its out of warranty and your going to have to pay for the parts and labor   that s when i blew up and told them all the problems i had with this new car   they didn t seem to care so i hung up and went to the dealership and wasted my time arguing about it   i left with the problem still needing attention   about a month later i had another problem with the car   the car wouldn t come out of park until you messed with it for about ten minutes   i called the dealership and asked for the service manager and told him what i was experiencing now   i didn t get anywhere with him   i finally had it and put the car up for sale and will never buy another br br  
275,0,  last year   my wife needed a newer car than the    buick she was driving   i had read reviews and information about the contour touting it as a pretty good all around car   i was worried about crash worthiness though   if i remember correctly   the contour doesn t usually score well in all areas of crash protection   when i factored in all the considerations i decided to stick with the contour nonetheless   i do still   quot like quot   the car   the biggest reasons are the comfort of the car in general   the mid range size of the car that wasn t easy to find in other models   the seats   the fuel economy   and the way it looks   if only   quot looks quot   were everything   the worst of the bad news about this car is that although it is only going on   years old it feels like it s going on   years old   it hasn t quite gone over    miles yet but you d think it had gone way past   further   we have just started experimenting with putting a car seat in the back for our baby and it doesn t look like it s going to be a good fit   also   if you need the rear seatback to fold down   at least on this non sport model   you can t   i agree with any of the professional consumer mags out there that say body integrity is poor   also   mechanically for the most part   we don t have much confidence   if you own one of these and you haven t had trouble with the brakes yet you are very lucky   ours needs   new rotors because it vibrates or shimmies when it comes to a stop most of the time   the car has been driven on the highway most of it s life and it already feels like it could use a whole new suspension under some circumstances   the engine is noisy in most situations other than cruising at a steady speed and the car could use a little more power   the car often stalls out after it s first started   thank goodness i can t think of much to say about the transmission although it s nothing to rave about   looking back on it   although we certainly could have done worse than we did   we wish we hadn t been so patriotic   if we had bought a honda   subaru   toyota   or nissan even if it would have had a few more miles on it   i would probably be writing a more positive review now     
276,0,  i originally bought my   with    miles contour because it looked real nice   and it was very comfortable   about a year or so later i started getting noises from the dash   center console and some near the rear window   i have always loved and have always bought exclusively from them but   this car has irritated me with it s creaks and clicks   after having it for over a year i am trying to trade it in   but the lots are starting to get an inventory of the    and earlier   driving the car   i must admit is very fun   the handling is superb and with only a   cylinder engine it is pretty quick   everything is real responsive   i am not sure about the later models but this one is a curse to all who hate noises as they drive   but if you can get a quite one then you will love to drive this car everywhere     
277,0,  bought a   contour sport v   speed with    miles on the odometer in    thought i got a good deal   i was wrong this car came completely loaded    power everything   leather interior   fog lights   etc   unfortunately   this car proved to be about as reliable as your average yugo   i had this car for all of    miles   yet i had to replace the water pump twice   the fuel pump   the rear main seal on the engine   a     repair   and i sold it when it needed an    emissions system repair   this car only had    miles on it when i got rid of it   yet the resale value was terrible   and just about everything on the car had failed   my opinion of this car is that it is a complete piece of junk   avoid at all costs    spend some extra money and buy a honda or toyota   the contour v is fun to drive when it runs properly   but is it not nearly as quick as advertised   the   hp v seems pretty weak the manual transmission is very slow   and the low end torque is minimal   this car may seem like a bargain when you first look at it   but look a little deeper   mine needed    in emissions system repairs when i traded it in    and this was at    miles   do you think a honda or toyota would require repairs like this at    miles   found on road dead is not such a bad acronym  
278,0,  this is probably a dangerous time to write a review since my check engine light just came on again   but i have finally been provoked to dole out some public disdain for the current sedan offerings from   especially after a recent spike in expensive repairs on my torridor red contour gl   as with many people   i found the contour to be a good handling   fun to drive car   and it came at a price too good to pass up   about     with everything a college student could use   power mirrors   door locks   a c   an interesting but chintzy cup holder   all for the aforementioned low price   i purchased the contour to complement the   that i had inherited from my father thinking that it would reliably serve my needs as i commuted to college and began working after graduation   little did i anticipate that my    would be of so much use to me over the next five years as my only working car not scheduled for maintenance   i have about    miles on my contour   and only keep it because i have finally set up the suspension and wheels tires just right to out corner unsuspecting bmw drivers on the   freeway in los angeles   there is no cheaper car on the road that can handle corners better than my contour   and that helps keep my wallet open and me under the car or visiting my dealer   but sometimes love just isn t enough   especially when it is so confined to the cornering ability of my modified car   the brakes are disc drum and fade at the hint of being used for spirited driving   which isn t too much of a concern unless going down hill   because they usually cool off by the time the under powered engine can get the car to the next corner that requires braking   i am out accelerated by everything   the four cylinder engine needs a lighter car to pull around than it s assigned   mid sized   contour chassis   the svt would have better suited me   but it was too much money for my budget and still carried over the same cheap looking interior   in search of some performance   i have tried an open element air filter and flowmaster exhaust   which did help a little   but were too loud for me as i reached my mid twenties   searching for a quieter upgrade   i use tires that are a little bit smaller than stock to keep the revs slightly higher   i contest that the real nightmare for contour owners is not the interior plastics quality that is more of an annoyance and embarrassment   or the adherence to the standard recipe for another overweight under powered car to add to their lineup of tubby cars and rv like suv s   but the real threat is the consistent lighting of the check engine light along with other various failures that i didn t expect before    miles   the light is annoying in its frequency of attack   and it has been reset two dozen times already as technicians have tried to fix re occurring problems by replacing one part at a time   to make matters worse   it comes on and then goes out leaving me wondering if it just burned out from over use   technicians can not use the computer to pinpoint the problem when the light is out because it was told to me that the error code stored in the computer goes away unless the light has been on very recently   the short list of unscheduled maintenance and expensive repairs is as follows   manual transmission failed and was replaced with the clutch   catalytic converter failed and blocked exhaust   oxygen sensor wire became loose and prompted hundreds of dollars in unnecessary repair before it was found   rear window rain seal has been replaced five times and keeps coming off   both front wheel bearings have been worn out and replaced   windshield cracked when car was washed in the sun   other annoyances include the many recalls on this vehicle   the creaks and vibrations in the dash and rear side door   lack of rear legroom in such a large car   this is the last that i will buy because i have read too many stories reporting that these problems are not isolated to the contour line and because i dislike the feeling that i have put too much money into performance products for a car that will just fall apart in the next few years   i think that most of my problems occurred just after the    mile warranty had expired   just as marketing had planned the contour to be removed from the us   the contour will never be a proper sports sedan as the ad campaign had suggested it would be   and i only wished that i had realized this many years ago and sold it while it was worth     i hope that pesky check engine light won t cost too much to get fixed this time  
279,0,  how many recalls can a car possibly have in   years time   we purchased a   contour for use as a family car   liking the fact that is was a fairly affordable buy   however   from the very start we ve had problems with our vehicle   upon taking it off of the lot   we had the check engine light on   the salesman informed us that it was a common occurrence if the gas cap isn t put on tightly and that it needed to go into the shop to have the switch reset   in   years time   we ve had at least   recalls sent to us from   the excitement of having a new car wore off quickly when we noticed imperfections in the design and quality of the vehicle   almost immediately our clock light burned out   the cupholder   a single one   mind you   was broken after pulling a purse off of the passenger seat   the carpeting on the floor was fitted poorly and hangs out from the plastic molding on the edges   there is no excitement whatsoever to driving this car   it looks like a clone to many other models out there that have no major design features to make it stand out in the crowd   save your money and shop around for a better buy   you ll be thankful you did br br  
280,0,  what i said then   i have always liked the looks of the contour   but i never seriously considered buying one when my wife and i decided to cut expenses   it was clear that the easiest way to do that would be to unload my beloved focus zx   check out my focus reviews   after much wailing and gnashing of teeth   i set about looking at used sedans in the    and under range i drove them all   corsicas   neons   cavaliers   even an ancient camry   then i ran across a black     contour gl with    miles at the local dealer s used lot   it had the best ride and   except for the   l corsicas   the most get up and go   the contour is also the least boring to look at of any car on the list i had the car in the dealer s service department the first three days i owned it   minor glitches that the dealer took care of at no charge for me   they replaced the rear suspension links   which were making a horrible thunking noise over bumps   the belt and idler pulley   and adjusted the driver s door to eliminate a bit of leakage around the seal   since then   the car has been smooth running and trouble free some of the interior bits are a little loose   but no more than i expect in a pre focus car   all of the options and gadgets work perfectly   the highway ride is glassy smooth and quiet   and power is typical of the zetec engine if you keep it spinning in the mid range     rpm   the contour is capable of surprisingly urgent acceleration on the downside   my contour has a good deal of play in the drivetrain which makes smooth corner exits difficult   and standing starts take a bit of concentration to avoid chattering the too grabby clutch   i don t know if this is a typical contour problem my biggest gripe with the interior is the retractable cupholder in the center console   it s flimsy and too small for anything but a soda can   also   it s too close to the shifter and parking brake   i tugged the brake handle up with the cupholder open and lost some skin off of my knuckles in spite of my disappointment over giving up my focus   the contour has become an agreeable driving companion and i believe it will keep me happy until our finances stabilize and brings the focus zx to the states update january    what i say now   the contour started giving me trouble last august and hasn t stopped   out of the blue   the engine began to die at random intervals while driving   no warning of any kind   it simply shut off   the dealer had the car for the better part of a month and couldn t figure it out   after a while   they just gave up and i have had to live with it then the airbag light started flashing intermittently   so i traded the thing in on a   mitsubishi lancer   i m much happier now review on the lancer coming soon  
281,0,  i bought this car because it was saturday and i needed to get to work on monday   my other car died and i was in a jam   my wife and i knew this car salesman   so we told him to keep an eye out for us   we couldn t afford anything over    at the time   so when my buddy called about the   thunderbird   i jumped at the offer   we ended up paying about     and the shirts off our backs let me start by stating that i purchased this car with    miles on it and it currently has    miles   i will reveal how this car has held up after   years and    miles   and what i have done to it within my first    miles this car is fun to drive   there is something about owning a t bird with the    v engine   this car has everything power windows   locks   mirrors   driver s seat   rear defrost   keyless entry and alloy wheels   this car is fast too   i m sure there are some   cylinders that can beat it off the line   but let s see who s first to   mph   turbos need not apply the handling is a joke   this car likes to roll into turns no matter how slow you go   it sort of wobbles when i turn   it s not visible wobble   but it feels like it moves from side to side while turning   this got better after i purchased new tires for it   but it s starting to happen again with only about    miles on the new tires   apparently   this car only likes brand new tires   make no mistake   this car is not a sports car   sure   it has a   hp v   but the car is just to heavy and long   it bounces over bumps   and you ll feel every one   the steering wheel likes to shimmy too   again   this may fix itself when i replace the tires at first   the car s finish has held up very well   there is little rust to speak of   the only visible rust is due to a bent corner on the driver s door   i m not sure how the guy before me bent that   there is also some rust along the bottom of the doors   this is only visible if the doors are open and you actually look at the underside of the doors   there are a few specks of peeling paint on the black trim on the front bumper   the trunk lines don t seem to fit together evenly   but i suspect the guy before me was in a slight accident   now   the clearcoat is beginning to peel on the roof   after    miles though   you can t be too surprised the interior has held up very well too except the front seats   there are no cracks or blemishes in the entire dash board and there is no fading either   the only part of the interior that shows any sign of wear are the seats   which are very worn and uncomfortable   the rear arm rests are bulging out of their notches too   and the release levers on the front seats are busted   you can move the seats forward without using the levers   that s not a big deal though speaking of broken   the rear defrost took that path around    miles   the fluid monitoring system is gone too   i think the transmission missed the rear defrost   because it went around the same time   it took with it    sensors   some belts and hoses   the water pump   the power steering assembly   a turn signal assembly and some fuel lines   the mechanic actually said there had been a fume fire on my gas tank   i think i might have bent over on that one   but who knows   i think my tires are getting lonely   i will have to replace them in a few weeks   the passenger automatic seat belt is possessed   i just try not to upset it i have spent about    in repairs from august    to may of    it has been trouble free for the past few months   knock   knock   at least the dealership where i bought it from agreed to pay for half of my new transmission   which i had repaired elsewhere   that s a toyota dealership for you the speedometer only goes to   mph   that s pretty wimpy for a v   i ve had the thing burried way past    the radio rots   i m not sure if it s just old   or if radios weren t that good   years ago   there is an absolute lack of bass   my voice can go lower than these xs   i just put in a kenwood cd player and some polk speakers   even these entry level items are a vast improvement i may be crazy   but i love my t bird   despite it s shortcomings   there s just something about driving a v t bird   i will definitely miss this car when it s time to trade it in for a familymobile i would recommend this car as a first car for people in high school because it is a cheap car to buy   the resale value is horrible   but the v would get them into trouble and the v is laughable   it would make a good car for a single person or a couple who isn t ready   smart enough   to purchase a camry update      the new tires solved the wobbly turns and the shimmying steering wheel   this car handles much better now   so forget those negative comments i made about the handling   this car does handle more like a sports car now than it did   it is still a little off balanced as far as weight distribution   but the handling has improved   check out my review of the firestone firehawk tires update      well   the starter went out so i had to replace that     mile isn t too bad for something like that   that brings the grand total for the repair bill to about    since i bought this car in august of    i m not liking this car so much update      well   some clamp came loose on the radiator which caused some antifreeze to spill out   not too bad   only    update      the airconditioner needed to be recharged   figures   another    down the drain      miles update      the o sensors needed to be replaced again   this is the third time in    miles update      i put in another   grand into this thing   i replaced the shocks   oil pan   and a bunch of brake junk   i had to recharge the a c again   which is becoming an annual event   the check engine light comes on for no reason i must say

282,0,  an american legend after rented a   door mazda for one week   i was ready for something more powerful to drive around rough highways in the los angeles area during my business trip   what did i rent   a   door   which came with standard options such as dual airbags   cruise control   power windows   cd player and a c   in addition to those standard items   the car had a traction control   this i was impressed to find the traction control   which definitely helps to reduce the chance of losing control of the vehicle under bad weather conditions performance basically   there are two different models for     the normal comes with a    liter v   engine with hp   the gt models come with a    liter v   engine with   hp   because i only drove a non gt   i am sure that gt performs totally different from my review   as soon as i stepped on the pedal   i knew that i chose the right vehicle to drive around the highways of the la area   i could not compare the way the car accelerated with a   cylinder sedan   despite the fact that the car accelerated very fast   the noise from the engine was not annoying at all   i no longer felt scared when i was merging onto a freeway    people were flying on a merging lane   as a trade off to the fast acceleration   the fuel efficiency of the car was not so good   based on my rough estimate   the car drove about   miles per gallon   however   this is not so bad for a v   with hp   comfort the driver s side seat was quite comfortable   however   the suspension system of the car seemed to be not working as nicely as a regular sedan   like a toyota camry   basically   the suspension system does not absorb shocks very well   however   this seems to be a quite common symptom for a sports car   the inside space of the car as well as the trunk space seem to be larger than earlier models   this is definitely a big improvement from   s mustangs   design compared to s long time competitors like camaros and firebirds   definitely made a great improvement of its design and image   while keeping its identity as a traditional american sports car   the current body was designed based on the first generation   this car looks classier than ever   i guess i am not a big fan of those bad boy looking cars like firebirds and camaros    believe it or not   marketers for those cars target those people who are attracted to a bad boys image overall   i really enjoyed driving this car on the highways in the los angeles area   with this powerful    liter v    hp engine   this car definitely drives very well on those rough highways br br  
283,0,  i recently got to test drive a   with my friend who is going to buy it   the particular car we drove was a v manual transmission convertible   i ll say it right now    the car looks really cool   i felt like a millionaire driving it   bright yellow with a black convertible top   and a black leather interior   it s definitely a fun car   but only on the outside on the inside   you re treated to horribly uncomfortable font bucket seats   and an even worse rear seat   even though everything was covered in soft leather   the seats were hard and unforgiving   i can stay put in my   crx for   hours without a single problem   but my back hurt after half an hour of driving this beast   not only that   but the legroom was awful   i can completely stretch my legs out in my crx   i m     but in the my knees hit the dash with the seat scooted all the way back   what gives   i realise it s a sports car   but how hard would it have been to give you a couple extra inches of legroom   i won t even talk about the rear seat   it s more of a storage space for your stuff that won t fit in the tiny trunk than a place for people to sit next up   performance   for a car that looks so pretty   you d expect it to have the innards to back up it s racey look   not so my friend   i actually street raced someone   i know   not smart   who was driving a miata   i could see they had a five speed too   but here s the thing   miatas are rated at i believe hp    they re also a   cylinder   while the v is rated at hp   the miata won   and i was disappointed by the lack of performance in this beautiful car i was driving   it was like driving my mom s civic   except extremely uncomfortable   and with poor handling that reminds me   the handling   i m used to my little crx   which can stop on a dime   and with the right tires make   degree turns are mph   the seemed to hesitate when making evasive maneuvers   the car is pretty heavy too   which made it feel more like a truck than a sporty coupe needless to say   i can not recommend this car   it s too unrefined for my tastes   and lacks the amount of power you d expect from a legend   my friend bought it anyway   and that s great for him   but i ll stick with my crx   thank you very much  
284,0,   s ince late   when the taurus first was shown at autoshows around the world   it was almost an instant hit   people loved this aerodynamic   concept looking   car with no front grille   finally   in   the taurus went on sale   along with its sister car   the   mercury sable i driving impressions i   my tester    taurus    unlike the   models came with a more powerful    liter v as an option   actual horsepower specs are the same between the    ohv vulcan and the ohv essex v   but unlike the vulcan it reaches its   horsepower at a much lower rpm   and instead of   lb ft of torque it has a more impressive   lb ft   the    is fuled by multi port fuel injection and is a pushrod design   this engine is found in a multitude of   mercury   and lincoln automobiles   first seen in the thunderbird as a base engine   the   taurus still has the same axod   speed automatic transmission   but since   it has larger fluid lines so atf can lubricate vital parts more efficiently   you will notice that the    compared to the ohv    models that acceleration from the light is much quicker   hills are a snap   and cruising is hushed   at   mph the   taurus    is cruising at an aprrox    rpm   with the    it was a higher    rpm   for     engines are available    the base engine is a    liter that produces   horsepower   this may not seem like a lot   in fact it s not   but it does not do too bad of a job moving this car around   the     cylinder was dropped in    there is the vulcan v    liter which produced   horsepower   found in all models   and the    which is found in the gl and lx models   there is also   since    a new engine by yamaha   which is a    liter dohc v engine that produces an impressive   horsepower and   lb ft of torque   this engine unfortunately can only be found in the expensive sho   super high output   models i interior innovation i   the   interior   of the   taurus is almost all new for this year   the dash is totally changed from its predecessor   and is much easier on the eyes than it once was   ergonomics are very simple and easy to use   the lx model i drove had power everything   including leather power seats   with power lumbar support    speaker premium sound system which sounded excellent for a stock system of this time period   and manual keyless entry   one of my major gripes with the   taurus s interior is the lack of bucket seats   instead uses a split bench front which aids in more seating   however results in lower levels of support vs a bucket seat design    exterior innovation i   the   exterior   looks almost exactly like it did back in    very little exterior changes have occurred since introduction   the paint has improved over the   years   and the rear tail lights look more modern   back in   this car was still ahead of its time   gm still had its boxy buick century   and other boxy family cars   but they were starting to get the hint that had something going with this whole aerodynamic theme   in fact this style was so adored   in   the taurus was the best selling car in america i pricing reliability i   these cars go for very cheap today   the taurus has terrible resale value   but for those who need a car   but don t have a lot of money   this is good news   this car can be found for around      the only problem is   is that the   taurus has a reputation for being a lemon   i personally have never owned a   taurus   but i did own a mercury sable for over a year with the same powertrain   and it had loads of problems   including   transmission bands breaking    lots of money to fix   starter problems   alternator   fuel pump   power steering pump    lines   new struts   wheel bearings   and a few other things   the headliners on these cars are awful   since this is almost   most of these headliners are already ripped   you most likely will be hard pressed finding a    taurus with a mint condition interior i final thoughts i i do not recommend the   taurus   however if this car is a   must   on your car shopping list   i can t stress enough how important it is that you take it to a professional mechanic   these cars have been known to cause their owners a great deal of misery    other cars to consider i    honda accord b    chevy lumina   a href content   epinions content   a    my review b    toyota camry    buick le sabre    dynasty    plymouth acclaim    chevy corsica    chevy beretta    nissan maxima    nissan stanza happy car shopping  
285,0,  my parents bought the   taurus l brand new in august    i thought it was only the second car they ever bought that wasn t dorky looking   the other being a   monte carlo   it was white with a black interior   which proved to be very hot in the summer time   they gave me the car as a college graduation present in may   with    miles on it   i drove it to    miles somehow   i ll start by saying what i liked   styling   the taurus was a great looking car   about the right size to carry    people   comfortable seats   very legible gauges   good acceleration with the    v   great handling   good cargo room in the trunk   i also liked the air conditioner which was much stronger than other fords i ve driven when it worked   i liked the fake wood strip on the dashboard it looked like wood not plastic   the stereo speakers sounded good until i put a   watt per channel jvc in there and it blew them up in a few days   i also liked the big mirrors on the taurus   now for the bad   and there was a lot of bad   the car went through two transmissions   each costing     the ignition module failed   or   times   the fuel injection had to be replaced at    miles   i went through so many power steering pumps i forgot to keep track   i m guessing five or more   the five alternators lasted maybe    miles   water pumps lasted     went through   of those too   i got really darned good at replacing things under the hood   the factory radiator was plastic and it cracked through at    miles   the transmission s   always shifted hard and abrupt with a lot of gear whine   the cv boots were always disentigrating   the brake pads were good for maybe    miles a set   front rotors lasted twice that   rear drums went only    miles and this was with nothing but highway driving   the seats were threadbare before    miles   the windows   doors   and windshields leaked so badly that i eventually had to rip out the carpeting and padding and throw it all away due to mold   that revealed serious disfiguring rust in the unibody and floorboards   the trunk had a basketball sized hole in it from rust   the windshield would drip on my feet it rusted the brake pedal   electrical problem that was never solved began around k entire electrical system would go dead except the battery   which was fully charged   it would sit for days and then bam   it would decide to start     the ignition switch wore out every    miles   eventually the locking mechanism kept jamming so i took a crowbar and just broke the darned thing and started the car by just pulling up on the little rod inside the steering column   everyone thought it was a stolen car because of that no   just poor quality    the turn signal stalk broke off and the one i got at the junkyard broke off too   the cruise control worked sometimes   the prndl gear indicator was way off so it looked like it was in reverse when it was really in drive   the headliner fell out   the door panels fell off   the struts on the hood gave out so i had to prop it open with a x to work on it   the suspension was forever out of alignment the dealer service what dealer service   the dealers in louisville   ky are these giant conglomerate corporations that care about money not customer service   i learned to just go buy the parts and do the work myself as they either didn t have mechanics who were competent or they just rolled their eyes when yet   another   problem taurus came in for repairs   by the time i scraped together the cash to buy a new vehicle   the engine was just about shot and the cylinder compression was gone in two cylinders   plus the oil pump was gone and the valvetrain was tapping badly   sounded like an old chrysler slant six if ya know what i mean    the taurus left me stranded so many times i almost got fired from my job for being late or no show so much   the boss just couldn t believe there was a car this unreliable but it was true    so finally in april   i bought a new gmc sonoma   that s a total pos too read my review on that lemon here on epinions   i got    for the taurus on a trade in   and still owed    on it for repairs   it took me   years to pay off on a car i didn t even own anymore   no more american made junk for me   my next car will come from germany or japan   end of comment  
286,0,  my mom had a   taurus   i belive it was the first year of of cars   we were lucky to get the worst car ever   a   cyl   taurus   so depressing   my mom bought this car in   after her last car was stolen   ohhh i remember going with her to pick it up   it looked nice in the garage it was in   really it did   my mom started it and we were on our way   it felt like we were riding in an enclosed lawnmower   that is what it felt and sounded like   the way it sounded was the very least that was wrong with the car   in time the drivers side window became a problem   it was fine to open   but when it came time to close   the window went out instead of up   real nice for protection huh   the car was nt very mechanically well built either   i was lucky enough to be driving the car when its transmission droppd dead   that s right folks   pouring rain   up a hill   in the worst area of nyc and lots of traffic   i was nt too happy   and niether was the   cars behind me   someone did help me push the car though   so after the transmission was fixed it worked   sort of   a few monthes later the car went on fire   now that i think about it    it was taken to the mechanic at least once a week because the engine was smoking   severly overheating   did i metion we kept water in the car incase the car went on fire   oh yea   another thing   the hood could nt stay up by itself   he held it open with a hockey stick   oh yea and another thing about opening the hood   well the thing u pulled back on to make the hood release broke off   so we had to pull the wires with a vice grip   the windsheild washer pump never worked   and winshield wipers did nt work either   ok ok   and the rear bumber was falling off since the day we got the car   needless to say the tranmission died again   and my mom gave to car away   all these things happned within miles of eachother when we got the car it had    miles   piece of junk no br br  
287,0,  i had a   taurus wagon which i just got rid of   the reason   it cost more to repair the car than it was actually worth   so   we donated it to a local school   and the car s problems will be fixed   and it will be washed and waxed and hopefully whoever gets the car will be very grateful   after all   it was one of those   quot low mileage cream puffs quot   it only had     the first seven years were totally trouble free   but in late   early   it began to develop problems   the digital speedometer   always a mistake   and automatic climate control began to fail   there was some leak in the line to the speedometer   causing it to suddenly register   quot   quot   while driving down a highway   and the climate control system would blow either too little or too much air it was basically as uncooperative as possible   that spring   the transmission began to have problems   it was mainly having problems going from first and second gear   but it got so that we had to manually shift the car from first to second   so   we took it into the shop   and they claimed to fix the transmission   but of course   it was a dealership   and they basically lied to us   they temporarily fixed the climate control   but it broke again   things were ok until december of    when the drivers side power seat simply failed   i was never too confident in the design   especially considering how much stuff is hanging down below that seat   it just doesn t look as well designed as other power seat systems i ve seen   and   finally in may of    a head gasket blew   and a belt snapped   its been parked on the street every since   while we debated and procrastinated deciding its fate the night it was towed away   i still remember that the interior smelled fresh   the car glistened in the moonlight   and the tow driver was truly amazed we wanted him to tow this   quot new car quot   away   and   on the whole   it was a very good car   the   l v   was very peppy   handling was secure for a wagon   and the climate control and trip computer were all somewhat ahead of their time   a bit too much   so it would appear   we also miss the cargo space tremendously   it was a good car   but it simply was not reliable br br  
288,0,  my parents bought this car when i was elementary school and i loved it   for a family car   this had enough room to keep my parents from constantly telling my sister and me to stop arguing about space issues in the back seat   but things began to take a turn for the worst about two years after the purchase of the car used   it then being around   or   years old   about   years ago   my family was riding home in it and the air conditioning just went out like that   no warning   just stopped   my family did not have a lot of money to just dish out around   dollars for another air conditioner   and i found out later that this is a problem with many vehicles until the mid   s   so if you do purchase a vehicle before    make sure that the air conditioner is working or is new   because if it isn t new    times out of    isn t operational   i began driving the car two years ago as a junior in high school   living in texas and not having air conditioning is a scary situation and led me to almost pass out on one ride home   but there are other problems with the car i would just like to emphasize my sister has the car now and the last time i talked with my father he said that the transmission is about to go and for a   model   it only has    miles on it   during the time i drove it   it broke down on me three times   two of the times it was the water pump busting   the third time it broke down on me   it had something to do with my air conditioner   indirectly   apparently when your compressor goes   that is what happened to the air conditioning   it is directly linked to the starter in a vehicle   so if you try using something that requires using the compressor   it will stop you car   i did not know this at the time   so during a downpour   i needed to use my defrost because i couldn t see outside of my window   upon doing this   my car stopped in a busy intersection and i was forced to push my car to the gas station that luckily was right near where my car broke down   i have no idea if this car just hates me   or if it is honestly a bad car   my suggestion   please avoid   taurus like a plague   i knew two other people that had a car similar to this one and the air conditioner in their cars broke as well   if you live up north where the high does not reach   that frequently   then by all means   this car is probably the car for you   but if you live in a hot area   take your chances on something else br br  
289,0,  my taurus experience began in october of   when i purchased the car for around     i was attending stonehill college in easton   ma at the time and needed a vehicle to drive to quincy   ma where i live   at first the car was reliable and drove fine   but after a few months the problems started here is a chronological list of the problems i have had over the last   and a half years b jan      regulator broken   the car will not start i have this fixed b apr      car rattles   mechanic thinks it is the struts   but i do not need to replace them b june     ac broken   just in time for the summer   i have this fixed b feb      alternator broken   i have this one fixed b aug      problems shifting into reverse   the car takes a few seconds to shift into reverse   i m told there is a problem with my brakes   but it is not too critical b aug feb      reversing problem gets worse   mechanic tells me that my brakes are the problem   new brakes are supposed to fix the problem b aug        brake work   car still has problem shifting into reverse   mechanic now tells me that it is my transmission   estimated price for repair is    that value of my car is only    at best   so repairing it is pointless   i continue to drive the car as of june th     but the transmission gets worse every day   currently the car is at    miles the thing that was surprising to me about the taurus is that two of my friends taurus   died when the transmissions went   one died at around    miles and the other at    miles i am no expert when it comes to cars   but from my own personal experiences with the taurus and that of my friends   i would highly recommend seeking another type of automobile   from my current understanding   the taurus is not built to last and if you have one   expect the transmission to die good luck  
290,0,  i bought a   taurus station wagon in   to obtain comfort   and space at a reasonable price   i have now owned it for five years   it looked great on the used car lot   had less than    and passed the inspection of professional mechanic on the positive side   this car is smooth and comfortable   the seats are nicely padded and wear well   the controls help the driver and passenger determine the positioning and angle of each seat   it gets about   mpg   the paint has been durable the problem is the engine   there are weaknesses in the transmission   heating cooling system and power steering   these require thousands of dollars to repair   most every owner i have spoken to have reported the same weaknesses   count on rebuilding the transmission at about    miles   the heater and air conditioner are hard to get to and may cost about     to repair   the power steering begins to leak at about    miles   requiring the mechanism and hoses to be replaced   i gave my car regular preventative care   however   these repairs cost me more than i paid for the car   ouch in summary   buy this model if you can afford the repairs br br  
291,0,  the   taurus offered a comfortable ride for the two years i had it   but its list of problems are long and serious   starting with the outside   the pain has a terrible habit of rusting at the edges of the doors   while you can sand it off easily and coat it again in paint   the rust simply keeps on coming back   the engine is louder and a poor performer for being a v   gas mileage is average at roughly    the interior has problems involving squeaky door panels and power locks which break   idle can turn rough on a cold start   its very apparent when sitting at a stop light   the engine will rev up and down once per second causing the car to rock    a new o sensor did not solve this problem   by far the biggest problem with this car is the transmission   when it works   its sloppy   has a late   or no   downshift   and slips   when it doesn t work   you look at a    transmission rebuilding estimate   the transmission shop confirmed that this car has major transmission troubles   my taurus started losing fluid to the point where pouring fluid back was not sufficient   it leaked out the front seal the second the transmission was set in motion   while the car did its job   moving to and from school once per day   its not dependable  
292,0,  i don t like fords as a matter of practice   you see    i ve had two really crummy experiences with them   my first was a   taurus   problems started with that vehicle the first day i drove it home from the dealer and it needed a tow that afternoon   that was one of thirteen tows that vehicle needed in the    miles i put on the vehicle   and they never found the problem   the second problem is my current vehicle   the   taurus   which is in the shop as we speak due to a recall and several electrical problems that are being fixed under warranty i know   i know    i m supposed to be talking about a   windstar   and that s exactly what this review is about   i m renting one   and have had one for the last week a windstar is a minivan   i must also state that i dislike minivans very much   i think   without being insulting   that they look dorky and they re made for exactly who i m not    a soccer mom the trimline on this windstar is the se package   it is your basic package   not a whole lot of bells and whistles are included   but it does have some nice creature comforts   the one thing i have never been able to complain about with products is that they do make a rather comfortable vehicle this vehicle comes with a six cylinder    liter engine that produces   horsepower at   rpm and   foot pounds of torque at   rpm   it will climb hills   especially when you shut off the overdrive   by hills   i mean the rocky mountains of colorado   which is where i live   it is advertised to get mpg in the city and mpg on the highway   because i do a lot of mountain driving   i got far less gas mileage than what was advertised the transmission shifts gears smoothly   without any real jarring   in fact   i would say the transmission is as smooth as my taurus   it is a comfortable shift of gears that is barely noticeable unless you floor the accelerator   this leads to a very smooth ride inside the van there is no flashy trim with this vehicle that would distinguish itself from any other minivan   although it does have a factory roof rack and molded bumpers   that s the extent of the fanciness outside inside   it comes with two benches in the rear that not only fold down   but slide out of the vehicle totally   turning it from a passenger van into a cargo van   it does have an   pound payload capacity   and you can fit furniture inside the cargo area with the seats removed it also has front and rear climate controls   which was a neat idea   the front passengers can control the temperature for the front of the vehicle   and the rear passengers can control the temperature back there   this is neat for children who sometimes complain that they are too hot or too cold this vehicle is also equipped with an am fm cassette stereo   while the controls are simple to figure out   the sound is rather poor   i m not sure if that s something unique to the windstar or if that s something that s common in minivans   either way   even hearing talk radio clearly means some heavy manipulation with the bass and treble controls another funny thing with the stereo was that when i turn off the engine   the stereo keeps running   i can pull the key out   open the driver s door and close it and the radio still runs   this vehicle is equipped with an accessory delay   which allows you to manipulate the stereo and the windows after you ve already shut off the vehicle as an insurance adjustor   i ve never been a fan of this feature on cars   there are far too many things that can accidentally be done where a car owner can be sorry about later   windows can inadvertently be opened and i don t trust electrical components    especially electrical components    to work as advertised   has a lousy history with me and their electronics the seats provide   plenty   of room inside   i certainly can not complain about my six foot frame being cramped   i would say that a seven foot tall driver would run into a headroom problem   but legroom and headroom for me was not an issue on the other hand   the seats aren t comfortable   they are very stiff and thin for bucket seats   there is a plastic armrest that can be lifted and lowered   but it is at an unnatural position when in the lowered position   my arm feels like it is sitting far too high for comfort   i have chosen to keep the armrest up i noticed that the two passengers i took    both women    got in the passenger seat and immediately raised the armrest out of the way   so it isn t just me if you don t wear a seatbelt   the seatbelt indicator will stay lit   one thing i did notice as i was sitting at a drive through window at a mcdonalds without my seatbelt on was after about twenty seconds   there is an annoying alarm that comes on telling you to buckle up   as far as i can tell   there s no way to shut up the alarm aside from buckling the seatbelt   this is a good feature for people like my dad   who for some reason refuses to buckle up the passenger bench seats are as comfortable as bench seats can be   they provide little support for the lumbar or the thighs   but then again i ve never been in a vehicle that does   while they do come out of the vehicle   they don t feel rickety and have a rather secure feeling part of that secure feeling may come from a pain in the backside   literally   to take the seats out   it s supposed to be a simple process    you fold the seat down   tug on a hook on the floor   and the seat is supposed to slide right out   i don t claim to be the most mechanical person in the world   but it took some engineering thoughts on my end before i was successful in removing the seat from the floor the vehicle does come with power windows and power locks   the power windows are rather neat   the front windows go up and down just like in any other car   however   the back windows   pop   in and out   like van windows did   they just do it automatically   as far as i can tell   there is no way to raise or lower the rear panel window in the liftgate the liftgate does open straight up and is a single door in this model   while this is a tall vehicle   people of shorter stature   is that the politically correct term these days   should have little trouble reaching the liftgate in its open position   i have to give credit for this feature there are two sliding passenger doors on this vehicle which makes for a very nice option   while i wasn t hauling around cargo or kids   i could see where this feature was a blessing   especially for cargo   it meant that with the rear seats out   you could slide the doors open and have someone pull from either direction to help load the vehicle   with the sliding doors   you can also park in very tight spaces and still gain access to the vehicle the doors do lead me to one major complaint   when i was growing up   my mother taught me that chivalry was not dead and that you open and close car doors for your women passengers   as i stated before   i had two different female passengers in this van the problem arises from the fact that some idiot at chose to put the only outside key entry to this vehicle in the passenger door   while many vehicles these days have keyless entry   this particular van didn t   this meant i had two choices    i could leave the vehicle unlocked   which i am not a fan of   even if it isn t my car   or i could run over to the driver s side   unlock the door   open it to unlock all the doors and then run back to the other side of the van to open the passenger door well   here s a newsflash     that s a lousy idea   you lose major points with me on that   even if most people would find that complaint silly other features include power mirrors   a securelock anti theft system and dual air bags so   what are my recommendations   well   i d say if you want a comfortable ride in a minivan   then the windstar is for you   if you want a comfortable minivan   you may want to look elsewhere   i m pretty annoyed with the idea that there s no passenger door entry lock   i don t like the accessory delay feature   and i don t like the strangely placed armrests for the front seats i m going to be generous and give the windstar three stars out of a possible five   for me   that s a good rating on a   for a vehicle in general   that s a mediocre rating overall br br  
293,0,  i rented a vehicle for vacation last week and unfortunately they didn t have much of a selection   so i ended up with a new windstar   my first impression was   quot what a piece of junk quot   the fit and finish is absolutely horrible   the quality of the materials makes this van basically like a large economy car   maybe the      version comes with better material   the stereo was decent   but its radio reception on a scale of   to   was a negative    there s no antenna in sight anywhere   so i m guessing it s just a wire hidden under the windshield or something believe it or not   my opinion changed when i first drove it   it s a real blast to drive   it has pretty good acceleration and braking   although the unrefined drivetrain feels too much like my large e full size van   since it s built on a car platform   it rides nicely   very low to the ground   and it doesn t feel like you re going to tip over like in most other vans   fun to drive or not   the materials still kept their cheap quality   and although the steering wheel was kind of nice   when i reversed out of a driveway and tried to shift it into drive   the position of the steering wheel never let me view the dashboard to see what gear i was going into the seats were pretty comfortable   especially for this type of vehicle   the power driver s seat is the best   the passenger s is okay   and the   bench seats in the back only hold a total of   very small children comfortably   family van   i guess   but definitely not a van to hold more than two adults overall   it s an okay van   good for those on a budget   and who don t mind admitting it by buying one of these   the styling is kind of nice   although it s apparent that took a chevy venture and added some newedge   think cougar   details   if you re observant   you can easily tell how much the owner paid for each windstar by the regular or elaborate front grille   the driver side sliding door is    useless   and it s even hard to get in by the one on the other side because a large and very annoying seat belt makes rear passengers feel caged in   the only other thing i have to say about it is   why is this van so radically popular when it is a   pretty shoddy   and b   a total spinoff of gm s vans   br br  
294,0,  our family recently purchased a new   windstar sel and so far i have been very pleased with the purchase   which when you read on you ll understand that this is saying a lot we are a family of   with two boys   and    the wife an i both work outside the home and i drove a   explorer and the wife drove a    door honda accord   we love to go camping and we pull a medium size colemann pop up camper when we are able to go   i was starting to have serious problems with the explorer   and we decided it was time to buy a new tow vehicle   after looking at other manly vehicles   tahoe   lincoln navigators   suburbans   etc   i just couldn t justify their cost and fuel mileage   besides the wife typically takes the boys   and their friends   to recreational activities   so she would be driving it as often as i did   after some discussion   and believe me i was not an easy sell   we decided to look into mini vans as an option to replace the explorer needless to say   i swallowed my manly pride and we are now owners of a mini van   after looking into many different models we decided on because they were offering   months     financing at the time on the windstar and they came packaged with the best options for the price   we purchased an sel model with leather   cd cassette   dual a c   back up sensors   and power sliding doors   driver    passenger side   etc after owning this vehicle for   months now   we could be happier   yes me too   gas mileage in town is been running    mpg   and    on the highway   it has plenty of power to pull the camper and plenty of room for kids and related sporting equipment   i am very picky about vehicles and this van has impressed me as being very solid and free from defects   i do hear quick and slight drive train grind when initially driving off after the van has been parked for a while   but it only lasts a split second and doesn t re occur until the van is stopped and restarted   the other annomily that i ve heard is the occasional sound of water from the a c dripping on the exhaust when going down the highway finally   i thought that the power sliding doors was a bit too much when we first purchased the van   but after owning it for a couple weeks i realized just how conveinent that option was   no hands door opening   keeps kids from scratching the doors   ensures that they can get in even on hill sides   and makes it nice for putting groceries in when your hands are full   oh yea   i now drive a   dr honda accord to work each day   quite a step from a suv update   we had just returned home from a   hour road trip only to have the transmission completely fail while trying to take off from a stop light   it gave me no warning of any kind   just a large crunch when trying to accelerate away from a stop light   get this   the warranty expired less than   days earlier and after the road trip the van now has k miles on it   has agreed to pick up part of the cost but i m stuck with a    repair    oh   yea a rebuilt transmission could cost anywhere from     to      the main problem is that uses the taurse transmission in these mini vans   these transmissions are alread plagued with problems and when you add the extra   lbs of a mini van   it s just asking for trouble   if your debating the different mini vans   look beyond and go with toyota or better yet honda   i ll likely trade mine in as soon as it gets back from the dealer   my advise   stay away from products with fwd automatic transmissions  
295,0,  i am a soccer mom   and i got this car at a discount   but if i were to do it over again   and i won this car in a raffle   i d throw the keys away first let me say i ve driven this car for   months   so what i write   i write from experience   some people may find the following complaints nit picky   but   i live in my car   i drive the kids to school   i pick them up   i go grocery shopping   shoe shopping   and clothing shopping    and except for food   none of it s my own   i shop online for clothes because there are simply not enough hours in the day to shop for me   and   yes   i go to and from soccer games and soccer practices for   of my   children   i spend a lot of time in this car   if i could afford it   i would trade this in for almost anything else   but alas   the loan is still worth more than the car now you know i hate it   this is why   cup holders   automatic door tracks   storage   keypad entry   rd seat   gas mileage   snow   noise   and did i say cup holders cup holders sounds like a trivial thing   but it s a big issue   there are two up front   they pop out with the ashtray   if you put in a heavy drink   whether a full water bottle or a coffee thermos   and you don t close the pinchers   the drink ends up on your foot   if it s heavy enough   it ll end up on your foot anyway the first time you make a turn   also   i should note that if you want to recharge your cell phone of you have a passenger charging his laptop   he ll have to hold his drink   there is an additional port by the passenger   but it s so close to the floor that no cell phone could be used if plugged in and few laptop cords i own an sel   it comes with a front console between the bucket seats   it has no additional cup holders in it   this is significant   suvs often have a place for drinks on the console   not the windstar   there is no alternative place for cupholders for me   and no place to hold a drink for a kid who can t reach his her own cupholder   the sel comes with nd row captain s chairs   the cup holders are near the floor of the chairs and flip down   kids in carseats can t reach them at all   younger children not in carseats still have trouble reaching them   adults sitting in those seats have to grab the drink from the top   if it s a soda   or worse   coffee   from fast food   the top can and does pop off   the rear bench thankfully has decent cupholders   but they are the only ones   the toyota sierra has cup holders that fold into the sliding doors   almost everyone else does not have the pinchers   with as much time as we spend in the car   it is unrealistic not to have the kids or me drink something at some part of the day   we get drinks spilled alot   then the car starts to smell   it s amazing how fast and how bad a little orange soda or the smallest drop of a vanilla shake can smell   don t discount this   lack of useable cupholders is a big issue to anyone who drives    but especially those of us with children automatic closing doors   the sel has one on each side   the smallest piece of crayon   a stray nickel can keep it from closing   sometimes these things get stuck in the track to the point where the door doesn t quite close   but can t then open easily either storage   if you aren t using the third bench   the windstar probably has plenty of room   i wouldn t know   i have   young children   which means my options are either a minivan   with the nd and rd row intact or an extra large suv   anyone who owns an extra large suv   and we do   knows that they are not the car that you take to zip in and out of busy parking lots   you may be able to park it   but you might have to choose which side of the car gets to exit   the doors are large and swing open wide   so   the third bench is stuck there   more on that later   that means there is less than   cu   ft of storage space behind it   that is peanuts folks   if i put an umbrella stroller back there   and that is the smallest version of stroller out there   i am hard put to fit a weeks worth of groceries in the back   if i put the stroller in the passenger compartment   then the kids trip on their way in and out   even weekend trips tax our abilities to travel comfortably   you leave the umbrella stroller home   add a portacrib   give everyone a small duffle and that s it   you are out of room   half the windstars around here have luggage carriers permanently strapped to the roof with good reason let s talk rd bench   it is big   it doesn t split in half   and it is heavy as hell   my oldest daughter lost her retainer in the car   i had to take out the third bench and both captain s chairs before i found it in the well of where one the chairs hooks in   i did it myself   i am a small but strong person   but i can tell you i hope i never have to do it again   even with two people   getting the third seat out is unwieldy at best   and getting it back in is even worse   the manual sucks and the levers stick   and hope you never have to do it if you own one   everything disgusting and vile congregates in those wells keypad entry   all of s suvs have this feature   the sel is the top of the line   it does not   if anyone is going to get locked out of their car   it s going to be a parent   because their kid is going to close the door on them before they have removed the keys   gas mileage   if i m lucky i get   city and    highway   not close to the    i live in a place that gets a lot of snow   it s an urban area and we have pretty good snow removal   the windstar s version of alltrac isn t bad   however it s ground clearance is terrible   i have gotten stuck in parking lots and driveways where snow has built up by an exit or in the center of a lane   however   i think the ground clearance thing would be true of almost any minivan most of our relatives live a couple hours away   once this car gets on the highway   it is loud   no joke   i don t hear as well out of my left ear   driver s window side   and with all the driving i do   i can t tell if it s from the car or the baby   who i usually carry on my left hip as i said   i have four small children   as in they would be crushed by airbags if they sat up front   i don t have a lot of choices in cars   and until i ve paid a little more off on my loan   i have no choices   don t make the same mistake   the grand caravan has tons of room behind the third seat   i think almost twice as much as the windstar   but if i was to get another minivan   i think the honda would be my car   that way   if i wanted to go to bjs   i could easily make the rd seat disappear   but   once this lemon is paid down   i m giving serious look at the buick rendevous   with the snow around here   central mass   i need something that can fit   kids easily   and please   not with a nd row seat that you have to pop up to get to the back bench   with more ground clearance that is still easy to park at the soccer field or the local shop n stop  
296,0,  that is what i was told by a a engineer who i met with to discuss a vibration in the gas pedal at    rpm   since that time the vibration has gotten much worse   and at times the transmission hesitates shifting to the next highest gear   he also told me that his bosses   windstar had the same vibration   he stated to me that it was a   normal operating condition   to me it was not anything normal and i would not have purchased a   windstar if i would have noticed it during our test drive   the first time i noticed it was when we were driving   hours and i noticed it at highway speeds and my foot started falling to sleep   i questioned the engineer at the time if this was   normal   then why did fix the problem in the   models   he did not answer me   i did not have this vibration in my   windstar   why was it added in   and removed in    my concern is what does it mean   could it be mismatched parts   incorrect tolerances   something wearing in the transmission     and will i have a problem after    miles are on the vehicle   consumer reports even suggests to stay away from several of the model year windstars   including the   model   additional note i talked to an ex engineer at and he was not surprised what i was experiencing   because his parents complained about the same vibration in their   windstar   the questions to ask yourself is what did change in newer models and why if in their words the issue in the   model is a   normal operating condition  
297,0,  i am a former salesman   yea   i sold a couple of windstars   but practicaly had to give them away   before i go in to this i want to say that it did receive a five star safety rating   which is the highest a vehicle can receive   very safe   well from the impact of another vehicle   i was particulary excited to show couples the windstars at the dealership because there were always high bonuses on them   i sold a windstar that was a new   model still leftover from a year ago at      under msrp   and i made close to a thousand dollars of commission off that one van   the dealership took a big hit   but they were losing    a month for just having it on the lot   that happens after the vehicle sits on the lot for over   days but over   days it gets ridiculous for the dealership to hold on to   so if you have to have a windstar make sure you don t pay for it   that s just the point of view of a salesman   not a high demand now that suv s are popular   think about an expedition instead low rating because of lack of popularity br br  
298,0,  we had owned a caravan but swore off them when the transmission failed at k miles   the windstar styling appealed to my wife and the safety features   side airbags   back up sensor   were not available on other vans of that year   the van is used primarily to carry the kids to school   swimming   etc   gas mileage is not great   in town   highway   the first problem we had was excessive oil consumption   the dealer fixed it under warranty   the problem was never fully explained but we also had to have an update to the computer   fuel injector cleaning and an oil change   cost    next the automatic side doors started sticking open   these were adjusted by the dealer under warranty   we passed on the   had to have   cooling system flush   tire rotation and oil change   saved    at k miles i wanted the transmission checked as it appeared to take too long to engage when shifting from p or n to d   said there was nothing wrong with it and specifications allowed up to a   second delay   we had to have another computer update   a transmission service and an oil change   cost    at k the front brakes had to be serviced   pads and rotors were worn beyond acceptable   we didn t use the dealer for this   saved    at k miles the lower tie rod ends had to be replaced   cost    plus the   had to have   fuel injector cleaning   cooling system service and battery test   total cost    but after complaining to we got    refunded against the tie rods at k the mass air flow sensor and the master cylinder pressure   speed   switch failed   plus another update to the computer   cost    and finally at k the transmission had to be rebuilt   cost    additionally there is always some little thing going wrong   the electric seat   the radio speakers   the rear wiper   etc i like the looks of the van but i will never buy another  
299,0,  a friend of mine just paid more than     to try to get the comfort i have in a van almost ten years older and     cheaper   we have a   model aero star   this van is awesome and most comfortable   the windstar has much less head room than the aero star   it is much easier to get in and out of the older van than the new one   even with the so called upgrades has established in their newer vans it is apparent they cut too many corners in developing the windstar   our aero star was modified by qualico with more plush seats   and interior courtesy lights for each passenger   even so   the aero star vans that i have traveled in that are just off the production line are hands down better than the windstar   aero star were available with four wheel drive   this is not an option with the windstar   if you only have town driving to contend with and real comfort isn t an issue buy yourself a windstar   if you are looking for comfort and a more road compatible vehicle buy yourself a used aero star br br  
300,0,  if you get this car   i would suggest getting a cell phone because it is going to leave you stranded   we bought a   aerostar and as you can guess   it literally fell apart   we had to replace the engine   transmission   brake stuff   and many other vital parts   it left us stranded on i    miles from home with a   wheel drive   this means that you need a flatbed tow truck so that the gears didn t get screwed up   also   the electronics fail all of the time   this means that the windows   radio   ignition   lights   air etc don t work   the car currently has multiple undetectable flaws that leave us wondering if we bought the wrong car   now   we know   do not buy this car   the only thing good about it is the space   any car can do that though     
301,0,  in    i bought a used    windstar   like another complaint listed   i also had continual problems with the door ding going off   i oiled   sprayed and slammed   but the ding and light keep going off and have learned to just keep the radio loud enough to ignor it   i replace the brakes   times in   years   transmission filter   times and engine and abs lights kept going on and off   when the van hit k miles   it self destructed   suddenly gas started pouring out of the tailpipe   replaced sparkplugs and wires thinking they may be worn out   gas kept pouring out   i was informed by my mechanic it was the fuel injectors   at a cost of    each     plus labor   gas kept pouring out   it came down to the computer which is neatly hidden in a   hour labor cost to just remove   computer cost    plus labor of     after    the van ran for two weeks when the whole brake line broke here is where the van becomes extremely dangerous   when towed to a mechanic who specializes in racing cars began working on the brake line we made a shocking discovery   my mechanic tried to purchase another line from   but they no longer make it   while checking the path of why the brake line just blew out   my mechanic realized that the brake line is right next to the catalytic converter   the converter gets extremely hot   heating the line up and causing extreme pressure to the lines   which eventually causes the line to break at a connection or melt down and explode   my mechanic claims this should cause a total design recall on the part of   these vans could explode and you would not only lose your brakes   but perhaps your life i am happy to be alive   however someone else may not be so lucky br br  
302,0,  we were rear ended while in our   grand caravan   which i love to pieces   and had to have it repaired   needing a mini van   we ended up with a   windstar   granted it was the lowest possible model that the rental agency purchases   but this van was terrible   it had the get up and go of a snail   and the blind spots   boy   if you ever wanted to purchase a vehicle with really bad blind spots   this would have to be the one   you can turn   twist   and do all the maneuvering you want and you still can not see out of those rear windows   the vehicle felt too light for being the size it was   but then i am used to driving a   lb caravan   it did stop quite smoothly though   you did not have to mash on the brakes and throw everyone to the front of the van   the seats were a bit uncomfortable   and even in the basic model   for being the price they are   seemed to be missing quite a few features that you would expect to see   like something besides a plastic steering wheel   the road noise was also quite terrible   i felt like i was yelling to the passenger so they could hear me   over all   i would not purchase one these   but please remember that this was a rental vehicle that we only had for a week   i would stick with my caravan any day br br  
303,0,  make it simple strengths   huge cargo area with the rear bench seats removed    great when we moved cruise control has been great on long trips    gas mileage hovers around   mpg highway   weaknesses   transmission has been the biggest problem so far    i m not pleased at the way the resale value is plummeting just   months after purchase   book value is half of what i paid for it just   months ago    with    miles it may be time to cut my losses and go for a suburban   also   i don t like the fact that there are no headrests on the rear bench seats   since my kids are small   i didn t pay attention to it until some adult friends came along for the ride   and now i m paranoid of serious whiplash injuries if we ever get rear ended   overall   i m getting my money s worth out of this car   but it could have been worse   i bought it used with    miles on it and the dealer put in a new transmission less than a week after i drove it off the lot   fortunately this dealer offers a three month warranty on any used car so it did not cost me   however   the new transmission failed within a month so they replaced two sensors and put in another transmission   again at no cost   so far so good a year and a half later   the only major repair after another    miles is the steering arm on the front passenger side   otherwise just routine maintenance   after reading other reviews i guess i can t complain yet   the dealer has made all the difference so far    they have treated me great   i was in a loaner car for several days while the transmission was being fixed    great service and great attitude from the service team so far   and it s been the only reason i have continued to own products   i had an escort station wagon and a x before this   but nothing compares to my    mazda    which gave me a quarter million miles of virtually maintenance free service before giving up the ghost  
304,0,  first thing is   i did not purchase a windstar   i rented the windstar for   days   after the st   min   of driving this vehicle i instantly did not like it at all   this was a fairly loaded windstar   the seats were horribly uncomfortable   it had powered seats   but no matter where i positioned them   my top of my back and up had no cushion   i can imagine what kind of whipplash i could expect if i was in a accident   next i notice that   good ole   continues to make cars without a choice of circulated and re circulated ventilation   i think all the other car makers do   the ventilation system was very weak   the fan only had   speeds and the   lowest fluctuated dramatically   the buttons and temp   slide adjustment was very loose   i also noticed that the pedals where too close to the drivers seat   so the peddals where close the steering wheel was far   this vehicle had only   miles on it   i m average size man     quot   when you get out of the van   to open the back door it s   quot locked quot   very annoying   the stereo had very small buttons   example was the am fm button   ride was like a boat   a lot of swaying from side to side   engine noise was abundant and   quot throaty quot   acceleration was uneven   sudden jumps when applying the accelerator   braking was the worst   very mushy and very hard to stop   i would not recommend this vehicle at all   go purchase a chrysler minivan br br  
305,0,  i bought this vehicle used in   because i was expecting our first child and the sports car just would not do any longer   this was not my first choice for a sports utility but at the time the price was right   we paid      and it only had    miles on it   it was driven by an older gentlemen who had kept it in excellent condition and had only used the   wheel drive in snow   it has the eddie bauer package   power windows and doors   rear window defrost   cruise control   and a tow package   i loved it at first   but then after only a year   i started having problems with it   the check engine light would come on but whenever i stopped it would go off again   it spent   weeks in the shop with no problems found   on my way home from the shop   wouldn t you know it   the light came on   only this time it never went off   the shop at our dealer said it was just a sensor gave me the bill for     and left me there almost in tears   two weeks later   we started the same process with the rear anti lock brake light   three years later i am still driving with this light on as no one can figure out how to fix it   to make a long story short   we have   in   years   replaced the oil pump   times   the brakes i couldn t tell you how many times   and other items relating to the engine so many times that we finally had it rebuilt in   and i am still having problems with it stalling all the time   it now has    miles on it   i love to drive this type of vehicle when it is running correctly   i can see where i am going   even in the pouring rain   i live out in the boondocks so i really need this type of vehicle to get in my driveway at times   i would recommend a sport utility in a heartbeat   just not this particular one   it has cost me almost twice what i paid for it in mechanical bills   there are parts on this vehicle oil pump   battery   water pump   fuel pump   that you can count on breaking within a certain number of miles   so whenever it gets close to the mileage on these parts   i just stay close to home   the wrecker service in this area is on speed dial on my cell phone br br  
306,0,  i bought my   bronco   years ago   it has a    l v x   i bought it for     and have spent that much plus more getting it fixed   it had one owner before me   when i got it it ran really great   at first   the windshield leaks   the front of the roof leaks so everytime it rains the inside of my truck gets wet   it also leaks wear the pedals are   it is currently in the shop getting the back brakes replaced plus all of the seals the axle that the brakes destroyed   my engine has     worth of work to be done   i have replaced my left window twice and the left door lock once   the air conditioner is also being worked on   i have replaced the exhaust system   the x has also had to be replaced   i know i m forgetting other things   i only get   mpg and with gas prices the way they are it costs me around     a month   right now i have    plus miles and a very big headache   i am a little person and feel very safe in this big truck but that is about the only good thing about it   do not buy this vehicle any one who has a bronco i wish them the best of luck   i think its time i get something else     
307,0,  we searched for and decided on this truck after the little isuzu we had conked out   we bought this truck with   miles on it   this is my husbands truck which i don t like to drive but have to sometimes   what is there about the truck that i don t like   i will try to be fair the truck is just a plain pickup truck nothing fancy   it is an xlt   door regular cab   and has a   cylinder engine and automatic transmission b features    automatic steering   the steering handles well and responds to the touch antilock brakes   they work   air conditioning cools off quickly   heat takes a little longer to kick in   power windows   this has a neat feature that i wish my van had   when the ignition is switched off the button that operates the power windows can be used if the door hasn t been opened   i always end up having to put the key back in my van and switching it on to operate the windows stereo with cassette and cd player shutoff switch for airbag on passenger side   can only switch on or off with the key   this is a great safety feature if you have a small child riding in the passenger seat or a toddler car seat there is a third window in the truck that is in the back windshield   this window slides back and forth like a sliding glass door b comfort    the seat belts are adjustable for comfort the seat has a lumbar support that helps ease the strain riding or driving there is not much leg room between the dash board and the seat   the seat slides back and forth and is adjustable   there is only room for two people in this truck   there is a third seat belt but it would have to be a small child to ride comfortably the instrument panel is convenient and easy to reach for the driver and passenger b what i like   i like the way the steering responds   i like the safety switch for the airbag b   what i don t like   i do not like the way it handles on a wet road   the truck is light and feels as if it slides when it is raining   if there is a strong wind the truck sways   the power of this truck is okay to drive on the freeway without getting run over   the drives okay in regular traffic and driving on regular roads   going up a hill or steep bridge it feels like it is straining to keep up speed   times like this is when i wish i had a straight shift   the bed of the truck is big enough to hold a good size load we have used it to move a daughters furniture   it drives more stable to me when it has a load   i would not use this truck to pull a boat and trailer there has been a problem with the light that tells you a door is open   it comes on when all the doors are closed and locked   i think my husband finally got it fixed the noise level of this truck is high to me   my husband says it is normal but it still sounds awfully noisy i would not buy another one   for driving back and forth to work and hauling groceries it is fine   i would not take a trip in it to the mountains  
308,0,  okay   i m not totally anti explorer   they re decent cars   and i think the firestone tire thing is not a major concern   but the   and   explorer doesn t handle as well as other cars in its class   namely the jeep grand cherokee and the nissan pathfinder   it s just no comparison   maybe it s the   quot one body quot   thing   explorer is put together from different parts rather than molded from one piece of steel   all i know is   my   explorer   which i sold after   months   can t touch my new   pathfinder   nor my   jeep   which i leased before the explorer and there were other problems   for instance   there was a lot of rattling   whenever i got out of the car after driving   i could here all sorts of   quot pings quot   and other noises   but the car was   supposedly   in excellent shape   and it drove okay   but i constantly felt like i was driving a big truck   and would flip on quick turns    not so on the pathfinder   or the new jeeps   or more expensive suvs   except the mercedes explorers have some major positives   keyless entry is great   and the headlights are incredibly bright   which is a nice thing if you live in a rural area   but the jeep s computer and the pathfinder s better stereo and related features   see my pathfinder review   more than make up for those loses if you have a good deal on a used or new explorer   i am not saying to definitely pass it up   i would just check out the pathfinder and jeep    and drive them all   a lot   around curves   on the interstate   before you pick one   on suvs   handling is the most important thing   i e   does it feel like a car or a truck   and i think explorers finish last in their class br br  
309,0,  that   explorer you may be considering is not as new as you think   sure   it smells new   it s shiny   and it looks modern   but the mechanicals underneath are anything but new the explorer started out life in    it was at the time   a break through   it handled nicely for a truck   had lots of room for people   pets   and cargo   and did everything well   the public reacted by making it the best selling sport utility vehicle in the country   and ever since   it has held that title   i can see the practical reasons why americans hold this suv so dear after a number of hours behind the wheel of my s jet black   explorer x   door xls the explorer does everything well for    of american drivers   the afformentioned room   reliability   towing ability   and resale value have made it a hit here but i am one of those    of americans who would find the explorer lacking   compared to new suv s   the explorer feels every bit of   years old   don t get me wrong   i owned a   explorer for   years when it was new   and i liked it   but compared to newer suv s   the jeep grand cherokee for one   the steering feels dead and it handles like a much bigger vehicle   the stock stereo is among the worst sound systems i have heard in a modern car   it is a stereo cassette unit with very bad accoustics   and to get normal driving volume   the stereo needs to be half way cranked up spend a little more and go for the all new from the ground up   model   it handles much better   is roomier   and can finally truly compete with the modern crop of suv s  
310,0,  i used to have this car   note the   used to   part   it was sold for a much nicer honda accord   the first thing you notice while test driving the    explorer is how bumpy the ride is   the shocks are a little too hard   even for an suv   going over speedbumps at mph feels like driving over a boulder in any other car after about   days of normal driving   you ll have to fill up the gas tank   and probably by that time you ll need an oxygen mask while you drive   the pollution from this thing is tremendous   typical of any wonderful   it s barely within our state s legal limits   even brand new   the gas mileage is advertised to be between    for a v   but it doesn t achieve even that   i found that under normal driving conditions   i could get maybe   miles to a gallon   if i was lucky   normally i got   or   on the average   pretty terrible   yes the suspension on this explorer was horrendous   every time you brake   the suspension creaks and groans under the stress   i tried to have it fixed while under warranty   but nothing could be done   even replacing the entire suspension system did no help   plus   the driver s side seatbel
311,0,  i am a mother of   small children who decided the time had come to purchase a minivan   after reading as many car magazines as i could get my hands on i narrowed the search to the windstar sel   and the honda odyssey ex   both of these models were new for   and they were the only ones who offered automatic doors   a seemingly great feature for a mother with small kids   at the time the windstar had a   star safety rating   the odyssey was not rated   the windstar was readily available   the odyssey had a   week wait   the windstar was a nicer looking vehicle   i purchased the windstar it did not take long for me to realize that i had made a terrible mistake   when we picked up the vehicle   we noticed the door did not close flush to the vehicle   the service department repaired it   one month later   the car battery died while picking up carpool   back to the service department   since that time i have been to the service department for a rear view mirror falling off   the gas gauge not being accurate   the door molding falling off   and a clicking noise from the steering column   these however   are only the problems that they repaired   to this day   the vehicle at times exhibits a   quot surging quot   sensation when going from drive to reverse or vice versa that they can not fix   in addition   the automatic doors are a huge safety concern   the dealers will tell you that the automatic doors retract automatically if there is something in the way   what they don t tell you is that you need to exhibit force against the door for it to do this   for an adult this can be done   although i have been bruised before   however a small child can easily be injured   in addition   the buttons for the automated doors are located within reach of a child   this makes for a fun toy for the child and a nightmare for the parent   you may think i was unfortunate to get a lemon   however   i have searched the internet and have found a high number of other windstar owners who are experiencing the same problems that i have encountered   i have also read of other owners having the front wheel fall off   many electrical problems   and i read of a child who s foot was badly injured from the doors   if you are considering purchasing this vehicle i suggest you visit cartrackers and edmunds   look through the forums and town halls and you will be amazed at the number of unhappy windstar owners i should also mention that has one of the worst customer service departments that i have ever come across   if you want to speak to a supervisor you have to wait for them to call you   and if you are not home you are just out of luck    case closed the windstar may be nice looking inside and out   but remember   looks aren t everything br br  
312,0,  i will be upfront with you from the beginning and tell you that i am not a fan   but that has nothing to do with the opinion i am about to write   my family of   traveled to hawaii for a vacation   we had reserved a mini van on the big island   of course we didn t know what we d get   we were willing to take whatever they gave us at the rental agency     gm   toyota   whatever   well   they gave us a windstar   which was fine   when we walked to the van   it was a nice looking van and we thought this would be a nice experience to get over some of our dislike for past products we ve had bad experiences with first problem was    we couldn t even fit all of our luggage into the   hatchback   area   some of it had to go into the back seat with one person sitting there   yes   i know we could pack lighter   but believe me   we were within reasonable limits   had no trouble getting it on the planes   in fact we didn t max out our limits there    next problem was the first time the driver opened the drivers door he wacked himself on the head because the door kind of curves down and in   making it so you have to pay attention every time you open the door   no stitches were involved but he did have a nasty looking cut for the duration of our trip next problem is that the middle seat in the back doesn t go all the way to the   edge   of the vehicle   like the astro or safari s do   so the adults who were riding in the middle seat had difficulty getting in and out comfortably   and when you are sightseeing   there is a lot of getting in and out and my last complaint has nothing to do with   but we had to laugh when we left the rental agency in kona   flew to honolulu to rent another van for a week and got another windstar   we asked for something different but they didn t have anything available   since we d already paid for it before our vacation   we didn t have the heart to walk away and try a different rental agency i do know that in the future i won t rent   or buy   a windstar there were some good points about it   like i said at the beginning   it is a nice looking vehicle   it does drive nice and i particularly liked the rear controlled air conditioning br br  
313,0,  we originally leased a   windstar and loved it   we then turned it in at the end of the lease and bought a   windstar anticipating we d enjoy it also   hated it   first of all   it doesn t look as sleek as the    secondly   it sometimes rides like a truck   not a car   after the wonderful experience of the    i don t understand what happened with the    it doesn t have as much room as the   either   the good thing is that it does have rear doors on both sides now   the bad thing is that you can only enter the second rear seat from one side it would be very helpful to enter from both sides   also   there s no longer a door lock for the automatic lock at the rear door   the sound system is good though   you should buy this vehicle if you have never had a mini van before   you will love it because you won t have any comparison   also   it does ride well after the st   miles and it s great for long highway trips   and for the money   it s probably one of the best values you can get   even though i don t love the car   i will say it s not a totally awful car   if i had never purchased the    i would probably think it s great   it has done great in safety tests br br  
314,0,  we bought our   windstar se in august    we looked at the windstar   the honda odyssey   the nissan quest   and the caravan   we decided on the windstar even though we would have preferred the odyssey   we didn t want to wait   months or pay over invoice   we ended up with a completely loaded woodland green se model because at the end of the   model year   the only sel we could find was gold   the only option we didn t add was the backing up sensors   the beeping thing   this is basically an sel without the two tone paint what we like we like the controls   they are very logically placed and if you have a large drink in the drink holder   it doesn t block the radio or other controls   the quest was the worst for this we like the looks   it is a very nice looking van   in our opinion we love the dual remote controlled sliding doors   my two year old loves to play with the buttons   so for now   we have it turned off on the main control and i only use the remote for it right now   i m concerned too about safety   i stuck the large plastic key holder box at the dealership in the door as it closed and it dented it   i have very small hands and no way would i test it with my hand   not worth the risk   the salesman did it though and the door opened back up it is very easy to get my   kids in and out of    months old and     years old it has a very nice   albeit noisy   ride   it drives a lot like my   honda accord did   i replaced the accord with the windstar what we don t like the windshield washer button is on the end of the blinker control   i can t tell you how many times i ve washed the windshield while turning the corner   lol   this might seem petty   but it is driving me crazy it is noisy   not in terms of squeaks and rattles   but general road noise   poor insulation   my older son likes to sit in the   quot way back quot   and i can barely hear him talking   it is quieter than the caravan though i slammed the middle two fingers of my right hand in the passenger sliding door the first time i closed it from the inside   the handle placement is very poorly designed   if you don t completely wrap your fingers around the handle   watch out when you close the door from the inside   i m afraid to close it now i ve never gotten more than   miles per gallon and i drive    highway   the manufacturer claims   city   highway   the dealer said there is nothing wrong with it   it s not my driving though   because i get   mpg in my husband s tahoe which has a huge v   engine and weighs twice as much while this is not necessarily a bad minivan   i would not buy this car again   i m already wishing for a new one we have not had this car in for repairs yet   we ve had it   months   but i have heard some weird transmission noises when putting in reverse   it also shifts from reverse to drive with a clunk and sometimes a lurch update     we ve had this car for    years now   it has about    miles on it   most of our complaints repairs have been nuisances   however   last summer   we had to replace the entire steering system at a cost of about      the cruise control   from the beginning   has only worked when it wants to work   not necessarily when we want it to work   they can t fix it because it always seems to work when we take it to the shop   the rear air stopped working   and luckily that turned out to be a fuse   the automatic doors occasionally don t work   we had the transmission reprogrammed   and it doesn t clunk anymore we are in the process of trying to sell this car as we have replaced it with a   honda pilot   which we absolutely love  
315,0,  fortunately i did not pay for this minivan   i took delivery of it in april   as my vehicle   i ve driven vehicles since   and have looked after them as if they were my own   i have always purchased them afterwards but this windstar will probably be the first exception in   years when i drove it home from the dealer and parked in my driveway   the hood looked like had condensation on it   unfortunately this was such a poor paint job it looked like someone had used an aerosol paint can to do it   i immediately took it back to the dealer where i was met with complete indifference and was told to   take it round the back to the collision centre   they wouldn t replace the hood and would only repaint it   three days later i arrived home with the new windstar   a paint job and   miles on the odometer once the weather warmed up the engine began to ping premature detonation of fuel mixture   at   rpm   i heard all sorts of reasons from   it s your ashtray   to   you must have had the van gassed up while playing the radio   this corrupts its processor   i had it in   times for this pinging until in september   the engine rattled so bad that it clunked to a standstill   totally seized at    miles   it took over a week to have a replacement recycled   engine installed and the dealer would not provide a loaner once the weather warmed up in   the pinging started again with the second engine   this time i went to another dealer in the next town   this dealer was excellent and within two visits have almost eliminated the ping by recalibrating the processor and installing a new style valve cover which has an additional baffle to prevent oil vapors from being burnt other poor points radio cuts out when a passenger gets into van   this is annoying when listening the news in a parking lot radio sometimes stays on when driver removes key and leaves van   when this happens   the power windows are still   live   this appears to have drained the battery several times   now i always check before exiting the horn is difficult to use   you must first find the seam on the large airbag cover as it s the only part that will sound the horn quite dangerous windshield appears to have a badly shaped area right in front of the driver which won t clean properly in icy weather seats are rather thin and small   i was in europe recently and my small econobox car over there had proper seats that actually were wide and comfortable   the windstar has lots of wasted space either side of the seats the roof on windstars has a strange seam on either side which appears to be filled with a hard putty   the paint soon cracks on this material rear speakers are intermittent because of poorly designed spring loaded contacts on sliding doors   i often clean them to get the rear speakers to work in damp weather the plastic panels squeak rear licence plate shield    light holders broke off huge turning circle makes these vans cumberson to park in tight locations good points good safety rating heating and air conditioning works well nice safe orange rear turn signals instead of confusing red ones engine is quite powerful but harsh if working hard fuel economy is actually not bad on long highway runs  
316,0,  i purchased a   windstar in november    initially   the car operated perfectly   however at    miles   the car locked up while in drive and nothing i could do would get it to move   after about   seconds   the car surged forward very fast and i had to slam on the brakes to keep from hitting a car crossing in front when the light turned green the car operated normally the dealer in tampa replaced several computer   transmission parts and assured me that everything was ok   three weeks later it did it again   the dealer could find nothing wrong with the car upon moving to alabama in july   the car repeated the lock up   i explained to the dealer that it was a safety issue and that i could be killed if i accelerated from a stop sign and the car refused to move for   seconds and then surged into traffic   again   they could find nothing wrong and there were no tech bulletins from addressing such a problem   in january    we were left sitting in a busy intersection when the car refused to go and then in    seconds   surged into traffic   the dealer contacted the regional rep and they promised me a new transmission in one week   three and one half weeks later   the transmission arrived and seemed to be ok   the second week   i noted that the transmission abruptly downshifted at about   miles per hour and slowed very quickly even though i was accelerating   it was as though i had downshifted to   quot   quot   the dealer gained access to a tech bulletin and adjusted the transmission   today i drove and found that the transmission does not downshift at   mph   it downshifts at   miles per hour   so much for tech bulletins   so much for   quot reliability is job one quot   i have written complaints to and called the nhtsb and they have done nothing   i have called several times without success   has anyone else had similar problems   if so   did you avail yourself of the lemon law   did offer a financial incentive to purchase another product br br  
317,0,   updated jan   hello all   an update to my windstar review is required   for those of you that do not tend to keep your vehicles for long periods   you may not care   for those of you that plan to keep your vehicle for   years or more   please read my update at bottom i never thought we would buy a mini van   i never liked the shapes   some of them look like bugs   then i saw someone driving the   windstar and i fell in love   i sent my husband to look at them   and he fell in love   why first off   let me explain that we have   children   one in a booster seat and one in an infant seat   plus   my husband is   feet   inches   we had to upgrade our car to a bigger car   a suv or a mini van   the car seats and my husband could not fit in our car anymore   we tried numerous suv s but none of them in our price range   around k   could fit my husband with the seat all the way back and the infant carrier   until we got to the windstar   we all fit very comfortably in it   my husband can finally drive a car without his knee s being in his chest   the only place he can not fit is behind the nd bench row   but   even when he is sitting in the second row   he is very comfortable   we purchased the lx model with   doors   one of which is an automatic door   for the additional money we spent on it   i was leary of it   however   its fantastic   how many times do the kids run to the car to wait for you to open the doors   not anymore   just press the button and they can get in and start getting buckled in   i have found that my mini van is getting excellent mileage   i can go about   miles with a full tank before i have to get gas   the car is user friendly and i love the overhead compartments that comes with the back seat headphone jacks so the kids can listen to their music and i do nt have to the main thing that i do not like about it is that i keep the rd row seats in because i never know when i am going to need it   however   then i don t have a lot of room for my groceries also   they sell a cargo net   but really they should include it for safety so that bag of canned goods wo nt fall on our feet one tip   no matter what car you are purchasing   i almost could not afford the monthly payments for this car   until we went online and found a dealership near us   not the one we were using   that specialized in online selling   we drove to them   about   miles from us   and we got about     in savings because we used the internet to locate them   so keep your eyes open jan      update   we have now owned our mini van for   years and   months   i have put somewhat more then average miles on it   i now have    miles on it   i have to say that i am looking to sell my car asap and will not get another windstar again   since my car was   year old   i have had major mechanical problems   of course these problems   big and small   were completly covered under the warrenty   i have had   new transmissions   a new axel    tires   and i do service regularly including rotation   fuel pump problems   many recalls   automatic door problems   new brakes added   humm   what else   i have had to have the lines flushed   air conditioner fixed   cd player replaced   had to have the entire power sliding door mechanism replaced   new front and rear break pads and rotors can i think of anything else   well i m sure there is more it will come to me   unfortunatly   i have also had major problems since my warrently expired that i have had to pay out of pocket for   since my warrently expired in july     i have spent about    on car parts service not including normal servicing   i am shocked that i have had these problems   but when we take our car into the dealer   we find that others have these problems too   it also seems that the dealers have trouble correcting our problems the first time because we somehow always seem to have to go back to get the same problem fixed   or   times before it actually gets corrected   yet   the service people never fail to remind me that the most important thing to them is getting an   excellent   rating on any survey card i receive afterwords   yeah   like that s gon na happen   inside   everything is ok   i still like the look   the space   the price   etc but i will never get a windstar again due to the mechanical problems that i should not have with a car with only    miles and a provable service record  
318,0,  the vehicle that i am reviewing is a   windstar mini van   this is a leased vehicle that is presently assigned to me while my new crown vic is on order   this van is as underpowered as the three aerostar vans that preceded it   this van has the ability to sound like it is picking up speed   but it is only an illusion   the engine revs up and it sounds powerful   but alas you can not see the speedometer climb faster   other than this being underpowered the roominess and creature comforts are average   the average gas mileage is   mpg with most of the miles on the freeway   this vehicle would be an ok choice if it s primary chore was toting junior to soccer or mom to the supermarket   if this van is to be used in a commercial operation the chevy astro would be a better choice br br  
319,0,  when i went on vacation with my girlfriend and her family to washington dc   from milwaukee   they rented a winstar to drive there   well   that was a huge mistake first of all   the minivan is really crampt   there were five of us and we were all squished together   there is no leg room and the trunk area is pretty small   there is a ton of wasted space up by the dash board and the seats are smaller so they could put in drink holders   once we got on the road   we found out how loud the van was   i sat in the back of the van and i could not even talk to the person in the front because the car was so loud   there were two main sources of noise   the road and the vents   the vents are on the ceiling and let out this loud hissing noise whenever they are on   also   we couldn t listen to the radio because there no speakers in the back and we couldn t hear the front speakers over all of the other noise the engine   i think it was a v    was underpowered and took a lot to accelerate   the van drove like a tank and did not have many extra features   also   for a new van   the air conditioning barely worked   overall   i was really disappointed in the car   but i have come to expect that from   i will never rent a car or van again br br  
320,0,  i loved it the moment my mom drove up in her new windstar   i said   my next van would be just like it   but in white   so when it was time to trade in the old van   i jumped at the chance to get my   windstar   it had low miles   just under     and still had a bit of warranty left on it   sad to say   it just wasn t enough time to find out what was truly wrong with my newly acquired vehicle the first week we had it   the lights began to flicker inside   we assumed that a door was ajar   but the warning light was not illuminating   we found out it was one of the many sensors inside the door   that   luckily was replaced free under the warranty within a few weeks came a new problem   the back windshield wiper   would work only if you slammed the back hatch door   another sensor is what i was told   and that bill was on me   we replaced the sensor   yet a few weeks later   it was on the blink again   this time   it was   as we were informed   a faulty switch   and would cost us to repair it   needless to say   we don t have a back wiper at the moment soon after this   i noticed that my rear view mirrors were vibrating while we were driving down the road   figuring it was in need of balancing   i had the tires and alignment done   this did not help at all   and the vibration was just getting worse just when i thought nothing else could go wrong   i found out that it could   the service engine light continually comes on and no amount of times that we have it on the   expensive   computer to test it they can find no valid reason for the problem as my transmission was shifting rather hard   i asked the dealer what it could be   i was then informed that the   windstar is notorious for having transmission troubles   this rebuild job is to cost me over     no i will not be repairing anything else on the van   it is going to be a trade in   just as soon as possible i have heard from others who have this year windstar   that there are two types of   windstars   the first being the one that never has a problem   and has grateful owners   and the second being the   windstars that got all the problems they could pack into one vehicle   guess which one we bought  
321,0,  first of all   i would like everyone to know that this is my first time in epinions because i want everyone to know what problems we ve been having wih our sel we bought the van last jan   my mom was suppose to get an odyssey minivan but we had to wait for about   to   months which we should have done it is actually my mom s van she s been really taking good care of it    months only   miles it s been to the dealer a lot of times with different problems   first one we noticed blemishes on left rear behind the sliding door   no quality control noticed a big blemish like that which was impossible to miss the dealer where we got the van had it brought to a bodyshop no problem with dealership they were nice   amp   helpful it took about   days then we got it back that was fixed then the electronic display on the van was reporting that there s a charging problem so we goback to the dealer it was the alternator   so now they have to replace the alternator so this was solved   and now the biggest problem the automatic sliding door one day it just wo nt shut tight it closes but it opens up a little bit on both doors so another visit to the dealer they adjusted it so it was ok for a while then it started doing it again so back to the dealer they adjusted it again now it got worse you could hear it scratching something inside the railing so now were up to the point of getting tired of this problem   now they are gon na change the two sliding doors if it   s still not fixed then i think it is a lemon because i think this vans were the first batch to come out that s why it has all this problems   onna have to call soon br br  
322,0,  i bought the vehicle when it was   year old and had   miles   it looked terrific i bought an extended warranty in that year and a half i had to do the following replace the rear window replace the tires replace the brakes      safety related recalls replace the front windshield wiper replace a heater vent damper      mostly labor   or i wouldn t have heat check engine light came on   they replaced the valve cover with a   revised design two weeks later   the check engine light came on again   this time they replaced the intake manifold gasket with a   revised design   plus a bunch of other emission control stuff that apparently got ruined by the bad gasket even though paid for a portion of a couple of these repairs under the warranty   i had to pay deductibles   pay for rental cars   they only had a loaner once   and only helped defray one of the rentals once   and the majority of all repairs was not covered by the warranty   i spent several thousand dollars to keep the vehicle running over the course of a year and a half other issues that i did not try to fix squeaks   thumps   bumps   rattles   plastic interior pieces that got warped by the sun   gaskets falling off all the time around doors   overall sloppy assembly and bad fit and finish my actions speak louder than anything i could write   i meant to keep this van for   years   but it was so bad i dumped it after a year and a half  
323,0,  we bought our   windstar lx used towards the end of my pregnancy with our third child   this is our first minivan    wanted to make sure it was well rated and safe   so we did a lot of checking around   the first   months went by without incident   but since then we have had nothing but problems   ironically   it all started immediately following recall service   the first problem was a wiring issue   it had died on me on my way home    we had to have it towed   they found that there were wires that had apparently been cut under the dashboard   this was not covered   being that   we found out then   our warranty had expired not by mileage   but years we were told by the salesman we had   year    almost    miles left   as i was driving home from picking it up from that service   i noticed the check engine light was on   upon checking my manual when returning home   it said to drive the vehicle through    cycles   before taking it for service   i did that    found out a week later that we had an oxygen sensor that needed to be replaced   also   not covered   i did at least get them to take the diagnostic charge off   being that whoever test drove it after the service should have seen the check engine light   anyway   moving on   next there was the idle problem i could start the car    it would run as long as i had my foot on the gas pedal   apparently a valve was getting stuck open    had to be replaced   immediately after this problem was fixed   i traveled to georgia to visit friends     upon trying to return home my transmission went out   at    miles   luckily   the only thing that happened is that the overdrive light started flashing after being on the highway for a few minutes     i returned to my friend s house   i have read about incidents where the van accelerates on its own   or takes off into reverse    weeks after trying to go home and a lot of stress   i made it home with my infant     sons just in time for school to start   i got the dealer to cover half of the costs   they have   hidden warranties   they don t tell you about called p and p   but it was still     needless to say i will not only never buy another   but i would strongly agree with others stating how awful customer service is   do a search on the internet about windstars    you will find as much information on transmission    steering rack problems as you do for the caravans   they say the customer service is supposed to be improving   but i don t believe selling cars that they know have problems is good customer service   this has been a known problem for years  
324,0,  i was shopping for a new vehicle and wanted something bigger   i thought i wanted a mini van   it had to have room for kids and dogs and lots of   stuff   i did a few some quick polling of people and realized that no matter what brand they were either loved or hated i went to a local dealer and found a   windstar lx   it was a nice van with only   miles on it   luckily i went on a saturday afternoon and an agreement was reached where i would drive it over sunday   easter   and come back to finalize the deal on monday on the test drive with the dealer it did fine except for the door sensors dinging whenever we hit a big bump   i was told that was common and would be cleaned and fixed   i really enjoyed the comfort of the drivers chair   it was truly like being in my living room chair and the ergonomics of the controls were great my girlfriend loved the ride as well and was sold on that aspect of the van   however   as we began our drive for easter dinner   the mechanical nature of the van began to show   first   the sensors for the doors that had just beeped and flashed when we hit hard bumps began beeping and flashing for almost any bump or curve   that is very aggravating and distracting   more worrisome at highway speeds the steering was awful and very   mushy   for lack of a better word   you could turn the wheel almost a quarter of a turn with no response and then the van would lurch the direction you were turning   every now and then the transmission would slip just a little   the brakes gave once or twice as we were sitting at a stop light luckily i had not paid for the thing yet and was able to return it   i did a lot more reading that night and found out all of these problems were rather common in a windstar   i took the beast back to the dealer on monday morning and drove home in an older nissan pathfinder with more miles   it may not be as comfortable but i have no doubt i can be driving it in ten years with well over a hunred thousand miles on it if you are thinking about a windstar beware  
325,0,  we bought our   windstar in december of    it had    miles on it   we bargiend with the dealer and got a   year k warrenty too   first impression we liked the deep red   like a good wine   hence the name   dark cabernet red   the interior was nicley appointed   but looked like it was done on the cheap   the tires where also cheap   but i blame that on the dealers replacements   it had a good radio and good a c and comfertably fit a family of   drivetrain the    v   has plenty of get up and go   it gets   around towan and   on the interstate   the transsmisson usually shifts smothly handling fine   it does become a bit hard to handle in an emergancy situation   but its fairly easy to control   the dealer had put ameri general tires on it   we replaced them with a good set of dunlops   it brakes ok interior cheap   several small plastic bits fell off and the rear a c control fell out during hard braking   the rear a c worked well   the seats where comfertable for road trips and my family never complained   the cd cassette delivered pleanty of good rich sound   reliablity here is my complaint and why we no longer have this van   doesn t make good trannies and this one was no exception   it was worse than normal   it whent out around k   fortunatly the extended warrenty picked that up   plus it had numorus electrical issues   the interior was falling apart and it just wasn t well built   i had all the usual windstar problems   do a little reserch like car trackers   and you ll see what i mean   i wouldn t reccomend this to any one  
326,0,  this is an update from a review i previously done almost two years ago   first my wife and i test drove several of the competitors at the time before we decided on the windstar sel   because i had a friend who was a fleet manager at one of the dealerships   i was able to purchase this vehicle for thousands of dollars less   which was a good thing because as time went on   i would have to use the money i saved to the repairs that were needed to be done after the warranty expired   here is my evaluation in several areas of the vehicle handling   it is very similar to all the competitors out there   my van had the upgraded suspension and    alloy wheels   going through turns at speed elicits some body roll but that is to be expected for a tall vehicle   turning radius could be better   both toyota and honda bests the in this measurement   the power steering in this vehicle is somewhat too boosted for my taste which means numb road feel   i have the sense of being detached from the road   the suspension absorbs large and small bumps very well to the point of almost feeling like being in a large cruise ship     in this mini van is approximately    seconds   making it one of the fastest minivans available   much of the credit for the handling can be derived from the use of the windstar platform actually using the taurus platform   comfort   you could almost live in the captain s chairs that are standard in this vehicle   it even has power lumbar supports for both front seats   the only thing missing is memory seating   seven people definitely can fit in this vehicle more comfortably than the toyota but is about the same in the honda   long trips in any of the seats will not elicit lower back pains   freeway driving elicits db on my sound level meter   for comparison   the toyota and the honda both registered db   wind noise is subdued   only engine noises when revved is somewhat loud   even today   the mini van doesn t emit any squeaks or rattles   interior features   power seats for both driver and passenger seats with power lumbar supports   leather seating   am fm stereo cassette with cd   on board diagnostic computer with outside temperature and compass   power mirrors   power windows   keyless entry with remote open closing of sliding doors   this was the first year introduced an additional sliding door on the driver s side   auto headlight feature   interior child light   fake wood trim   tinted windows   separate a c and heating compressors for the front and rear passengers   baby view mirror   garage door   coin and cupholders   security alarm and auto anti glare rearview mirror   at the time   honda s mini van did not offer leather seating unless you went to an aftermarket place to have it done   ingress egress   the only weakness here is that the second row captain s chairs are not moveable to one side   they move up similar to cars that only have two doors   if you are like me and have two kids in car seats and they take up the second row   it is difficult for adults to enter the third row to sit   you may want to choose the second row as a bench seat so that passengers will have room to sit in the third row more easily   getting in the driver s seat or front passenger seat is very easy because of the large doors and low step in height which is similar to most large passenger automobiles   drivetrain   this is the mini van s weakness   it is a four speed automatic with overdrive that you can defeat for those long uphill climbs so that the transmission will not have to hunt for the right gear to use   the transmission is smooth when it is working properly   the problem i experienced with the transmission was at    miles into the use of the mini van   i had to rebuild the transmission   yes   i had to have the transmission rebuilt   of course this expensive repair at    happened when my original factory warranty ended   the dealership denied my claim for warranty service even though the original factory warranty was   months    miles   my transmission failure happened at the th month of ownership   i also found out later   i was one of three   windstars that the local transmission shop was working on for the same problem   the problem is that uses low quality materials to produce their transmissions and the replacement parts of course are of a high quality material   when i saw the pinion gears   they looked like they had over    miles of wear on them   a design problem that contributed to this is that the transmission is from the taurus   a transmission designed for a vehicle that weighs   lbs   less than the windstar reliability   here is what i had to have worked on since the    years of ownership   four times i had to have the power sliding doors repaired because they always popped back open during a hot day   even today   it still happens from time to time   one time i had to have the cable that closes the driver s side power sliding door be replaced because the cable actually broke   as i said in detail above in the drivetrain section   i had to have the transmission rebuilt   recently   i had to have the driver s door handle plus internal mechanism replaced because uses plastic parts for this high use area to ensure replacement   economy   gas mileage in this vehicle is on par with other mini vans   the epa rating of   city and   highway is right on target   luckily this mini van uses regular unleaded unlike the honda and toyota which recommend premium   gas tank size is a very large   gallons for a great cruising range   insuring this vehicle is similar to all of its competitors   fairly inexpensive safety   this vehicle has anti lock brakes   front and side air bags   a five star crash rating all around   it was one of the first minivans to obtain this safety rating   now it s newest competitors from honda   toyota and mazda have the same five star safety ratings   summary   this mini van can compete easily with its competitors on drivability   handling   comfort and interior features but unfortunately has a poor reliability experience for me   i am very hesitate to recommend this vehicle to anyone because of the reliability issue   it is fine for the family that needs to rent one to use for a special trip but over the long haul   be prepared to pay the price for a fix or repair daily     that s how my wife and i have been feeling lately  
327,0,  let me tell you all a story   you can decide for yourself if you would consider purchasing this vehicle from this dealer or any other   i leased my   windstar about a year and a half ago from freehold in new jersey   when i picked up the van from the dealer i noticed a large tear in the carpet   how can this be you ask   after all dealers prep is always charged   i don t know   they agreed that it would have to be replaced   and ordered the carpet   i was also missing   of the original keys which they told me they had but never produced   so i had to bring the van in so they could make a key   ok   the new carpet is ready so i bring it in   leave it for   days   and then pick it up   when i look at it    the carpet appears to have been installed by a blind man   no offense to the blind   i tell them and now i have to leave it another day to fix that   well   that s all taken care of   but the sun is out and my wife lowers the visor which then proceeds to drop and dangle as if hanging from a thread   now they order a new visor and when it arrives i have to leave the van another day so they can replace it   a few months go by and i open the rear hatch door which proceeds to fall on my head   it seems that one of the pistons that support the door went bad and had to be replaced   time to order a new one and another day in the shop   a few more months go by and now the power sliding door doesn t always work   the rear interior light fell out and wo nt stay put   and the reverse sensors have stopped working   i bring the van back to freehold once again and leave it for a few days to be repaired   everything is repaired but they can t find a problem with the door   now i have it and the door still only operates when it want s to   some more time goes by and the transmission is now leaking   i bring it back again   they keep it for   days and give it back saying it s fixed   but guess what   still leaks and the door still isn t operating properly   so now back it goes again where they keep it for   more days and decide they have to order a new transmission   they will call me when it comes in   that process takes almost   months in which while i am waiting   the power steering goes and the interior power door button falls out and won t go back   yes   finally i have had enough   i go to the manager of freehold and explain everything that has gone on and tell him i want out of the lease   he tells me that he has to speak to the regional rep   he will get back to me   he then informs me that the rep told him he will not get me out of the lease because these are minor problems and the lemon law does not apply   i also call customer dis service myself and besides being totally useless a few of the reps were so rude i wanted to strangle them   now the trans   is in   so i leave the van again for   days   current situation is no transmission leak   power steering not operating properly   and the power sliding door still operates whenever it want s to   i called again and was told by the rep to   quot do whatever you feel you have to do quot   i asked the manager of freehold if i could speak to the rep myself   he said he would call the rep and get back to me   never did even after   requests   now i m not cutting down all products   but i am telling you that and freehold do not give a damn about their customers   you would think that with in the papers and the news every day getting negative press that they would be a little inclined to show the world that the bad publicity isn t all true decide for yourself     
328,0,  we bought this vehicle   months ago after the birth of my second child and felt the need for a little more room   i have to admit i bought the car because it looks good   the exterior is beautiful in my opinion and the color choices are many   the downfall is the interior   i m not a leather seat person and the sel only comes with leather seats   not heated   the dashboard has your typical   quot american car quot   look about it   the rear seat fold down very easily i must say   the ride is smooth but loud as most fords are   but it serves it s purpose for our family   room for all and lots of trunk space   i just don t feel we had to spend     for that     
329,0,  the story begins when we rented a   windstar lx   because our   nissan maxima was in the shop for a routine check up   then a mechanic went to park the car and had a mph run in with a garage wall   so while the car was getting fixed   the nearby dealership gave us a rental   we had it for a week and loved it   despite all the articles in consumer reports telling potential buyers not to buy this vehicle   we had a pleasant time with it   when you get in and drive the vehicle you can t help but notice it s size at in   but i am not just talking about its length   i am also talking about the height of this vehicle    in   those things don t pose a big problem though   because the visibility is great   especially with all the glass and there is tons of head room   the floor pan is low and that makes the windstar easy to get in and out of   the only thing that disappointed me with this van   was the amount of standard features   the simplest things like a cd player   center console and standard middle captains chairs would have been nice and probably got us to buy a windstar   but because the lack of standard features for the price   we will just stick with the maxima   lastly   if you don t mind paying    for a van with less standard equipment than a grand caravan or grand voyager   and having questionable reliability   then the   windstar is the van for you  
330,0,  my   windstar is a great van to haul my family of    the exception is a engine   spark knock   noise   i first noticed it at about    miles   currently at     i ve been back to the dealer five times now and each time they say it s normal unless the noise is heard during cruising speeds   it rattles at cruising speeds   during accelerations   and   quot whenever it feels like it quot   i ve used all three different gas octanes and i still have the noise   the highest octane works best but can you imagine my gas expenses for a van rated for   octane   as far as fuel economy goes    mpg is all i can get out of my van   the engine noise is most noticeable in hotter weather conditions   the hotter it is   the louder it is   the noise is annoying and i believe will result in major engine repairs in the future as it seems to get progressively worst in my opinion   there is a mechanical flaw but i can t convince the dealer or of it   i also noticed on this web site that others have indicated an engine noise in their opinions as well br br  
331,0,   l ike the   a href content   geo metro a   the tiny aspire has the same ultimate goal in mind   excellent fuel economy between point a to point b transportation   if you buy the aspire   and   aspire   something from this car other than the fuel saving micro machine that it is   than you are setting yourself up for a unfortunate let down    s ince the aspire s introduction in   as a replacement for the festiva   it has come in   trim lines   a   door hatchback and a   door hatchback   my test car   the same    liter sohc   cylinder engine has been used since introduction   the engine out put remained the same until its last year in    at   horsepower at    rpm   and   lb ft of torque at    rpm   offers   transmissions for the aspire   a   speed automatic   and a   speed manual gear box i driving impressions i   off the line   acceleration   is what you would expect from a car pumping   horse power to the front wheels via a   speed automatic   very slow   i m sure the standard   speed manual transmission would have increased the performance a bit   but we are still talking about a car with   horses and a curb weight of around   lbs   so even a   speed gear box would not have been the saving grace for this car   at a light   or from a standing start   the aspire   under full throttle   almost doesn t know what to do   at first the car stalls   as if it is preoccupied looking at the much more intimidating car next to you   then it realize s that the driver needs to move in a hurry and does its best to scoot from the light   unfortunately   its best   comes in the form of a buzzy exhaust note   tons of engine noise   poor shifting   and acceleration that could match an   speed bicycle    handling   is also not exactly something to write home about   the    wheels and the tiny     wheelbase make this car very skittish over poor road surfaces   and the suspension doesn t help this car achieve any driver confidence while on the twistys    cruising   in the   aspire is   to say the most   uninvolving and quite annoying   the    liter engine   when it finally does reach a freeway speed limit   is still very loud   wind   road   and engine noise plague the cabin of the car    braking    despite having a dinosaur set up of disc brakes in the front and drums in the rear   braking was quite good   braking in the aspire assured relatively quick emergency stops with little fade    fuel economy b   the   aspire is rated at   city   highway   yet i observed around   city and   highway   this significantly lower observed rating is undoubtedly due to the optional   speed automatic that was equipped in my tester i interior accommodation i   the   interior    unlike the performance of this car is not what you d expect   despite the tiny size   this car is actually relatively roomy   about the room you d find in a escort   the instrument cluster is easy to read   but the dash looks cheap   as does all the materials in this car   cheap   kids toy like   plastic is what has always loved to use in their economy cars   and the aspire is no exception   amenities are far and few   my option list included a   speaker cassette player   air conditioning   power steering   and driver    front passenger air bags are standard   the seats are stiff and offer no lumbar supports   but i found them to be relatively comfortable   and superior to the seating in the   a href content   geo metro a   front leg room is adequate   but like most compacts the rear is very cramped   the seats in the rear fold down to offer a boat load of cargo room   something i did not expect i exterior innovation i   you have no doubt seen the   exterior   of a aspire   they are almost everywhere on the road   despite being in production for only   full years before its demise in    the body of the aspire is very oval   almost reminding me of an   egg on wheels   i believe this opinion is shared by many   the wheels are also very small     so this exacerbates this unattractive   egg   theme   my test aspire came with a rear spoiler   and semi sporty hubcaps   i m not sure if this made this car look more   sporty   or made it look more like a mistake    price    reliability i   back in    the aspire ran for around        depending on the optional equipment   today most people who are selling their    aspire s ask for less than      if you go to a dealer used car lot you can expect to pay around     or more   these cars have been very reliable over the past   years   according to many owners   although i have a sneaky suspicion that these cars will have their share of problems after k miles due to the engine constantly working overtime to keep these cars up to speed b other cars to consider b    hyundai accent    escort    geo

332,0,  i m not a car person   i see a vehicle only as a means to get from point   quot a quot   to point   quot b quot   i don t know about cylinders or   quot x liter engines quot   or anything like that    i don t care   never have   and probably never will   this is why   several years ago   i was looking at the escort   it s pretty low price   available in colors i wanted   and had a lot more power than the honda civic pos that had spitefully sputtered and died on me on a deserted highway several months before   i had everything worked out    i knew what color i wanted   and i had a down payment ready    i was ready to sign the papers and drive out of the lot in my brand new car   i was probably a little too eager to get a new car   as i had been riding the bus to and from work every day for three months or so   when i discovered that my insurance folks considered the escort a   quot sports quot   vehicle   and wanted to charge me twice as much per month as the car payments would be   i was crushed   bitterly   i returned to the car lot to see what else they offered the salesmen   who i m sure was almost as disappointed as i was for not making the sale   pointed me towards s lowest level vehicle   the aspire as i understand it   the aspire was only offered in     after seeing the vehicle   i could certainly understand why    the aspire is an ugly vehicle   and i can t imagine how it could have sold enough models to warrant being offered again in     imagine a more rounded geo metro        no   wait    imagine an egg   yes   a giant egg that someone had the morbid sense of humor to fit with tires   skinny little things that are almost impossible to find replacements for when they go flat    i know this from personal experience twice over   it s a tiny car   but i was nevertheless amazed after opening up the hood by how incredibly   minute   the engine was   after spending too many hours groping around my old honda s engine in the past   cursing every time i couldn t reach a vital bolt because of the cramped space   i sighed pathetically at the thought of trying to navigate around the even tinier engine of the aspire   in fact   the only big thing about the car is the trunk space   let me give you an idea how big it is    i m a drummer with a seven piece kit   i can fit the   quot   bass drum in the trunk without folding the seat down   and fill the rest of the car with the rest of my drums and hardware   and still drive quite comfortable   despite the fact that   even after two years   i m still a little embarrassed by my   quot nanoo nanoo quot   vehicle   after folding down the back seat   over half the space of the car becomes trunk space   impressive   another impressive aspect is the gas mileage    the aspire s flagship feature   i suppose   it has a pathetically small gas tank    gallons   but that will take me about   miles   i often go   miles on a tank on road trips so   if you can get excited about pretty decent gas mileage and a lot of trunk space   and don t mind driving around in a giant chicken egg   go ahead and get this car    it s cheap   otherwise   don t make the same mistake i made   shop around and see what else you can get     
333,0,   i ntroduced in   as an    model the tempo was a sales success for many of its   years in production   and in its day was quite the proverbial   eye candy   today most of us frown upon tempo s   the tempo has set a negative example for many   once upon a time   american car consumers that now look for cars made overseas   for   the tempo was available in   trim lines    different engines   and   body styles   the gl   gls   and lx   all available in either a   door sedan or   door sedan   in   i was the proud owner of a   tempo gls   door sedan   the other models came standard with a   horsepower    liter engine   while my gls came standard with a ohv    vulcan v that pumped out   horsepower at    rpm   and   lb ft of torque at    rpm   hardly anything to write home about   but compared to the standard engine with the other trim lines   the    powered tempo was a real road rocket i driving impressions i   off the line   acceleration   came smooth and relatively quick   even with the clunky   speed automatic transmission   a   speed manual is standard   the   horsepower matched with a sufficient amount of torque reached at a relatively low rpm made it easy getting up to speed   while this engine also came standard in the sluggish   taurus   the    in the tempo allowed for significant improvement in acceleration thanks to the tempo s much lighter curb weight    handling   in the tempo was not much of a joy   while the gls sported a relatively sporty suspension   the car would take to the turns just like the base models   which was to say the very most    languid and boring   the steering was heavy   and the car felt deprived of any sort of excitement whatsoever    cruising   was also not the   tempo gls s strong points   the car was jolting on bumps   and punishing at high freeway speeds due to wind   road   and engine noise   the   speed automatic shifted fine   but at high speeds above   mph the transmission was not geared high enough to give a smooth ride   hills were taken well   rarely did the car have any troubles tackling hills   but again   only   speeds of gears really hurt this car s cruising capabilities    braking   was only adequate   the brakes never gave me a complete feeling of security while coming to a stop   the front disc   rear drum set up left much to be desired in this department    fuel economy   was also not the tempo s forte   despite only having a    v   the   speed automatic mated with this engine gave v fuel economy   i received around   mpg in the city and and around   mpg on the freeway b performance gripes b   where was the   speed automatic option   even the   escort had a   speed automatic option   no abs option   obviously did not have fuel economy   nor handling in mind when they built the tempo gls i interior accommodation design i   the   interior   of the   tempo was anything but fancy    basic   is the best word to describe the cabin of this car   the dash   even in   seemed very dated   and the instrument cluster was also something you d expect to find in a much older vehicle   amenities were adequate for me   ac   an am fm cassette player   power windows and door locks   cruise control   and tilt steering were about as much as you d find in the creature comfort category   the seats were made of cloth   and offered little support   or comfort   no bolstering whatsoever   the    tempo was offered with annoying automatic seat belts that would constantly get jammed   on a positive note   the   tempo was quite roomy   front and rear leg room were better than many cars   and the trunk offered loads of room for a small car    reliability issues b   in the   year and    miles that i owned my   tempo     total miles   it was plagued with problems   here is a list of problems i can think of   boots replaced   fuel injectors replaced   constant wheel allignments   power steering pump went out   transmission developed shifting problems   paint problems   clogged catalytic converters   automatic seat belts would jam up constantly   and the dash board began to crack i price i   new   the tempo gls ran for around      today   thanks to poor resale value   a gls can be had for around     or even less   i have seen them in the paper for as low as     with the claim that   it runs great    other   cars to consider in random order   b i    escort    mazda protege    honda civic    honda accord    chevy cavalier    vw golf    vw jetta    toyota camry    mazda     toyota corolla    happy car shopping
334,0,  i have a   tempo   and i wish i didn t   this car is the definition of the word lemon   everything that can go wrong with a car has gone wrong with this one   i have replaced two starters   the alternator   and all of the hoses   the electrical system has had to be rewired   the power windows only work on rare occaision   the power locks have never worked   the power steering has gone out   twice   the brakes are mushy   the gas mileage is frighteningly low   the service engine light went on the second week i had it   and no matter what i have repaired it never goes off you want more reasons to avoid this car   the jack that comes with it is useless   the windshield wipers stick   the turn signals have a habit of sticking   and not deactivating after you complete the turn   the odometer doesn t work   it leaks oil   it leaks transmission fluid   it makes funny noises   it dies constantly is there anything good about this car   i like the color   it s a nice bright red in conclusion   i hate this car   the tempo should be avoided at all cost br br  
335,0,  i remember the day my parent s came driving into the drive way with this piece of work   granted i didn t own a car at this point   but something told me the tempo was a bad buy to begin with there was no tape player   while this was only a small problem the fact that the speakers were rather cheap and would blow if i attempted to play a song at a loud decibel the basic scheme of the tempo   in my mind   was to build a cheap car that resembled something sporty   however   along the way they seemed to forget that people have a way of remembering if a car breaks a lot to begin with the electronics that kept track of the fuel   shorted out after about two months   when my parents went to return the car so it could be fixed they were told it would cost in excess of    i had heard from a friend of mine that the car was pretty much just a piece of trash that breaks every   seconds   but i could not believe this   how could the makers of the and thunderbird possibly make a lemon i had decided that the gas gauge was merely bad luck and one of those unexplainable things   but a short while later when the alternator went i began thinking differently   for the record we replaced the alternator three times   and eventually just gave up on the car and bought something else my friend bought a   escort about a year ago and the transmission and seat belt motors went   and presently my friend josh has a   escort that makes strange noises that are suspicious   perhaps   it s time for to stop trying to bring out new models like the focus and work on the lesser ones like the tempo i d give a b   or a   for the   thunderbird   and probe   but a c overall because of the tempo br br  
336,0,  it s a cheap car   good for a   quot first quot   car   but then again maybe not   i bought the car from my sister for      it is a   tempo gl   i probably put about a     into it already   my dad warned me though   quot you get what you pay for   you are going to have to put money in that car   since it is so cheap quot   well   i sure did   i had it less then a year   and it s been in the shop probably   times   new brakes   starter   all tie rods   battery   muffler   and a bunch of other little things   that all add up   not to mention a transmission leak   that s been leaking for years   oh   and for the interior problems   two out of the four windows don t work at all   they neither go up or down   the   quot power locks quot   never work   and the car makes a lot of noises when idle   the ride is pretty rough   and loud   i am currently looking for a new car   hopefully a   honda accord   it tells you something when a car like the tempo is recommended    of the time   with   out of   stars   and the accord is recommended    of the time with   stars br br  
337,0,  this is the first epinions review i have done for a car   i usually stick to pc games and the like   and it might seem silly to review such an outdated car anyway   but i m sitting here with nothing better to do and some things to get off my chest about this heap that i drove for five years   and where better to do it than epinions   i got my blue    tempo sedan when i was    it was a hand me down from my father   thanks   dad   that s the best hand me down you gave me since i genetically inherited your asthma   and was already a few years old   oh   and let me say this right now   i was working very hard to get good grades in a very difficult prep school and did not have the time to get a job and get something better for myself   okay   let s just clear up this little question before anybody asks it   some cars are unreliable enough to be annoying   a tempo is unreliable enough to be dangerous   things went wrong with the car almost immediately   the automatic seat belts froze in place   permanently   the power locks failed so many times that my dad just tore in and made them manual locks   saving ninety dollars every three months for new solanoids   the driver s side power window also quit working   of course   this made going through the drive through at restaurants   or just rolling it down for some fresh air   quite difficult   the only reason it was still possible is that dad glued a metal handle to the top of the window   allowing me a very low tech way to raise and lower it   the car lurched   lunged   and shook while i drove it   it made grinding noises and occasionally made a sound as if a massive sledgehammer was hitting the hood   the transmission   linkage   and suspension on a tempo are pure garbage   cheaply made   and shoddily assembled   the air conditioner broke on at least three occasions   the guy who fixed it on the second time pulled off the button panel to find that the plastic on the other side was melted   and that i was lucky the car had not caught fire   tempos do that   you know   they catch fire   and they burn   at least the brakes worked   if they hadn t   i might have been killed ten times over by now   i am over six feet tall   and this car was so cramped i could barely squeeze into it   my head touched the ceiling   it was like trying to drive a clown car   the paint came off of the roof in large patches   it didn t chip   but sort of   faded   away to reveal the primer   luckily   a tempo can t get any uglier no matter what color s   it is   i never expected much from this car   just a means of conveyance   and one in which i could have some semblance of trust and reliability   i didn t even get that   hey   at least i had absolutely nothing to worry about as far as car thieves were concerned   a thief would have taken one look at my car and kept right on walking   unless he had some giant stack of fifteen foot by twenty foot typing paper that he needed a weight for   when   old blue    as i liked to call it sometimes   other things i called it can t be written here as these reviews are censored   finally died   i was   and working a summer job between college semesters   the transmission bled out   leaving a trail of fluid in the car s wake   i got in and started her up   but the car wouldn t move   i inherited my mom s buick century   infinitely better car   after she got a new regal   there was just the question of what to do with the tempo   i wanted to push it into the ohio river or maybe take it to a gun range and shoot at it   but my dad decided to have it towed away and repaired   he unloaded it on some chump for five hundred bucks   i still think dad won on the deal   and i haven t seen it since   so ends the saga of my first and last car   i am man enough to admit that   on occasion   this car terrified me   i feared for my life when driving this car   i did not take it on freeways for fear that it would malfunction at   miles an hour and kill me   my father used to say things like    you should be grateful for this car   because you didn t have to work a day of your life to get it   in my day   blah blah blah   yeah   dad   whatever   he could have afforded to get me a new toyota or honda   but instead insisted on giving me this piece of sh   to   i suppose    teach me the value of a dollar   or whatever   it was a lesson that could have killed me   i saw that most other guys in the high school parking lot had nicer cars than mine   not because they had jobs   but because their fathers weren t tightwads   i felt jealous and underprivileged   i m not much for wrap ups where grades aren t concerned   so   the end ps   if you are a parent   you owe your kid better than a tempo for his her first car   ask yourself if it s better to   teach your kid the value of a buck   while putting his her life in danger   or to get the kid a honda civic so he she can learn to drive a dam   car without worrying about having to fix it every three weeks   see what you come up with   okay   i m finally done  
338,0,  this was my first car   i got it the day i got my drivers license   it was used   but it seemed like a good deal   and not to say anything too bad about it   this car served its purpose and got me around safely throughout high school and my first year at college   however it is really not that terrific of a vehicle   and it has some problems along with its good points first of all the alignment is off    completely   once when i got the tires rotated the servicer told me that there was no use in balancing them   they would just be unaligned the second i drove over a bump   and he was right   the wheels never failed to unalign themselves quickly   this caused the tires to wear unevenly   and it was annoying having to pull the steering wheel   degrees to the right to get the car to go straight also the paint job on this car was pretty awful   every time i would dry the car after washing it my towels would be completely red   also the black paint around the windows on my car chipped off    and every other tempo i have seen has this same problem lastly the speakers were pretty bad   one of them buzzed continuously whenever any base was turned on   i did have a great time in this car   it was a fun and great to drive around my small town   but it is not a powerful vehicle   and it does not handle very well   i would not reccomend buying one of these used vehicles   my old one now sits in a car graveyard after busting a rod through the engine   check out my review of the mitsubishi mirage to see how much happier i am now br br  
339,0,  we bought a used   aerostar in    our initial reason for buying the van was that we have   children    of which are still in car seats   with a family that size   our options were very limited initially we were pleased because with the   bench seats as well as the   front seats   it is a   passenger vehicle   which made it roomy enough for our crowd   even with the   car seats   there was still plenty of room for the other   older boys to sit comfortably without being squished   and during road trips our boys could get comfortable   lay their head on a pillow positioned over the arm rest and go to sleep while still buckled securely into their seats   also   since we had the extended cargo area van   there was plenty of room for hauling   whether it was the futon bed we bought for our toddler when it came time for him to move from the crib   or the computer desk   or all our luggage when driving from california to d   c   roominess was never a problem with this van what was a problem was lousy gas mileage   another problem was the frequent problems with the front end alignment   it seemed to never stayed aligned   regardless of how excellent a condition the roads were in   also the van drives very heavily   what i mean by this is that when going around curves or making a turn   it leans on it s side and makes you feel like you are going to tip over   true   this vehicle is built like a tank   and if it did tip over   we d probably be safe   but i m not willing to take that chance   also   the manuverability for changing lanes   pulling into parking spaces or any of the other simplist driving tasks   is terrible   the simplists tasks become major chores in this van   and the fact that it squeeks and rattles and makes a lot of noise doesn t make matters any better also   i have to admit that i did not like the air conditioning vents for the back   they did not cool   or heat   the back area of the van very well   even the children in the bench seat closest to the front of the van were often either not warm enough or not cool enough also   on the driver s side in the passenger area   there are some controls for the stereo   while this may seem a good idea for some   it was a source of constant annoyance for us   the children loved to play with the buttons and were constantly changing the radio station i can give this van one more bit of praise   for those of you out there that have a large family and are frequently taking road trips   the bench seats in the van can be taken out easily   and rearranged   we had the big bench in front at some points   at other points it was the small bench in front   but the arrangement that we used the most often and was what the children seemed to enjoy the most was when we had the front bench face backwards so that on road trips the children could be buckled in securely   and yet still interact with each other and share toys back and forth and finally   one last warning   during the     yrs we had this van we constantly had mechanical problems with it   also   since the front end alignment was frequently off   the tires wore down unevenly very quickly and had to be replaced more quickly then they would have been otherwise br br  
340,0,  my father owns a   econoline van and it the biggest piece of junk he has ever owend   the van rides well but it only has a   v and does not any power whatsoever   it has a spacious interior and alot of room but that is the only good thing i can say about it   the van averages only   mpg   you can not see out of the rearview mirror and it has no acceleration and you can not keep the front end aligned   this is not a good vehicle to buy in general   i can not recommend this van to anyone   it is nothing but a   lb   gas hog   that is my opinion on the econoline van br br  
341,0,  i finally took a close look at a expedition i ve been a x owner since the sixties everything from cj jeeps to ramchargers to broncos   i had the feeling from afar that this new rig was not like anything i was used to i was right it drives like a big heavy station wagon   with a slightly stiffer suspension than would have been found in the big wagons of the   s and   s   handling was fair    but the old bronco has it beat in terms of predictability on bumpy turns   loaded heavily   the expedition has a tendency to develop rear end sway and instability at highway speeds   it did not feel like a truck at all    and of course   that s s intent   the interior was impressive    all kinds of little gadgets   rear air   etc   etc   the seats were comfy   the driving position good   for forty grand or so   it should be fancy when you look at the front suspension   you know immediately why it rides as it does struts   cv joints   torsion bars it s a car suspension   not really for trucks   that s ok for the average owner who has gotten one because he or she needs a big   tall station wagon with   wheel drive   this machine will not do well off road in really nasty conditions   it s obviously not intended to raise the hood and you see a backyard mechanics nightmare   if you like to work on your own machine    say   to change the plugs once in a while   do oil changes and the like    you will not enjoy this machine   half the engine is up under the firewall cowl   change the plugs   not from the top   you won t   but if you can afford one of these   you can afford to have it worked on and cost of doing a job under the hood will be high    lots of stuff in the way and lousy access means longer times for various maintenance tasks i don t like the expedition at all   looks great   drives ok   nice interior appointments    fine for anyone who is not a x purist   but if   like me   you want something you can fix in a pinch and take anywhere   then this ain t the rig for you br br  
342,0,  things have simply gone too far i have long supported the suv craze   no i do not desire one myself but i believe in life   liberty   and the pursuit of happiness   if an individual so desires one of these lumbering goliath s known as the expidition   who am i to question their decision   i am but a humble boy who drives a fuel efficient civic i must now take a stand   i must now declare that i was wrong in my support for i have only egged on the boggling dimensions of the suv engineering philosophy   i must now rise up and denounce all the soccer moms and all the weekend warriors   i must rip apart my misguided goodwill and throw it to the side   things have simply gone too far this morning   driving to work   i   well   i er    how to put this delicately   i saw a midget driving a expedition this fellini esque circumstance freaked my world if you know what i m saying i am six four   tall by some standards   average size by these bean stalk kids i see sacking my groceries in the stores   despite my lanky stature i have always driven small   compact   decent minded cars   it has not been a decision of preference but rather one of economy   why would i want a monster to guzzle up all my hard earned dollars on gas when i can blow them on beer   video games   and cd s i have long been content to tour around town in a minuscule ill endowed boy vehicle   i have justified the suburbans lumbering along beside my trusty old civic with its dead head sticker happily advertising my social demeanor from the rear window   as cars of practicality for some   you see i have no children   i do not coach a soccer team   and my bikes can easily be hung on a trunk mount for my one weekend warrior exercise i called my dad   the not so proud owner of a jeep suv   and informed him of the horror i witnessed this morning   i heard him say    hey cathy   my son just saw a midget driving an expedition   to another worker in his office   then i heard laughter this was no laughing manner you see these misinformed people knew not of the psychological scars i had borne this frail morning   i was sitting in wall to wall traffic listening to my favorite morning talk show   i was laughing along with the jokes and feeling a bit peckish from not eating the night before when all of the sudden i felt the earth move   the sudden quake of the soil beneath me meant only one thing   there was an suv approaching i looked up to see the driver of the vehicle   i love kids so i was expecting to see a weary mother driving her three kids to day care   it s always a pleasure to see a group of rambunctious kids horse playing in the back of an suv or mini van   with a smile upon my face i girded my expectations for such a sight   then the expedition drove up and inside sat one solitary   little person do not read me wrong   i have nothing against dwarfs or midgets   i have received much contention on this site in the past for my review of austin powers ii   i called mini me a midget and i received hate mail from a person of little stature saying that he was in fact a dwarf   not to argue semantics but i have always heard people with the unfortunate condition called midgets so i m sorry if i offend anyone out there i was more disturbed by the sheer ludicraceness of the whole event   here was a person that needed a fourth of the amount of room as myself driving a car that was four times as big as my own   did they have children   did they coach soccer or baseball   why did they buy this mistake of a vehicle   i was boggled beyond simple mundane ordinary confusion   i felt the juice i had ingested earlier that morning swelling up in my stomach and my ulcer began to throb the expedition gets twelve count em twelve miles to the gallon   my former boss owned a suburban and he said it cost him fifty bucks to fill up his tank   how much would it cost to fill up one of these my wife and i rented an suv for our honeymoon   a rodeo   it was a small suv   as we drove across death valley i would say to my wife    here s a gas station we d better fill up she would look at me in confusion and say    why we just filled up thirty miles ago   then in understanding she would pause a moment   look down at the dash realizing the monstrosity of the vehicle encasing her and say   oh yeah   we ll stop here i have to pee anyway when shopping for an suv please do not consider size   when the expedition came out it was test marketed in the dallas area   the news crews were interviewing people about it   i remember clearly one lone man stating   when asked if he would buy the boat    yes   i like it   it s big for those of you who feel the need to drive around in a monster   raise the wheels on your truck   take the muffler out of your pinto so that at least it sound big   please do not purchase a expedition   they are unsafe   scary to little cars   and impractical   buy a semi instead   i m at least used to those i do not think a midget wearing a suit and driving an eighteen wheeler would cause me such mental distress br br  
343,0,  what is white   not black   and red all over   me   after being struck head on in a collision while driving at least   mph   i   klaxonman   a caucasian male   became red all over    red from blood   there is absolutely no need for such large vehicles   they only spell trouble   while the driver of these cars may be safe   are the people driving the sedans   no   not at all   i suffered at least three broken bones in my rib cage   and i lost quite a bit of blood from cuts due to shattered glass   had a smaller vehicle hit me head on   the result may have been a bit different   another poor aspect of such large suv s is the fact that they are gas guzzlers   virtually any sedan will get mileage that is twice as efficient as the expedition   that will cut your gas bills two fold what i am trying to say is   don t just think about yourself when purchasing such a large vehicle   think of the other drivers on the road   while this review may not relate to the specific car   i hope this may sway your decision of purchasing a tank of a car   do you need a lot of room in your car   try a mini van   having trouble handling in rugged terrain   there are plenty of   wheel drive vehicles which come at a much lower price and a much smaller size   before you decide to purchase the expedition   just think of these two points     large suv s are much more dangerous to other drivers than sedans    you will be saving a lot of money in purchasing a smaller vehicle with that said   what advantages that the expedition may have can outweigh the disadvantages of purchasing of such a large car   i think the choice is easy br br  
344,0,  expedition into vanity   selfishness   and irresponsibility i realize that this may not be the forum for such a discussion   but i know some people about to buy an suv will read this   and i am curious about what they think   are suv s a guilty pleasure   or a bit irresponsible   these days in america   capitalism and consumerism are the twin gods that no one dares blaspheme   and the auto market is perhaps the arena where these gods exert the most influence   we love dogs   dogs love trucks   we love trucks   i understand that for many many people   an suv is a sensible purchase   however   going off road is becoming more and more rare as there becomes more and more road and therefore less and less off road   from what i have seen   the bumpiest road that a majority of suv s see is a gravel driveway   but why do i care   live and let live   right not really   first of all   because suv s are bigger and bigger   it becomes less and less safe to own a small car   i mean   a expedition could run over one of those festivas and not even know it   this is an alarming trend   the first jeeps managed to be hardy without being hummers   but others don t seem to think this is possible   secondly   and i am no eco terrorist here   but the gas mileage thing does seem a bit short sighted   thirdly   the sheer tonage of an expedition does a lot more damage to city and suburban roads than a smaller car would in conclusion   it seems to me that a lot of the reason many people buy suv s is simply vanity   cars once had vanity plates and now are becoming big packages of vanity themselves   i realize that often the american dream is measured in terms of how many cars fit in your garage   living in a city   and near decent public transportation   i have managed to live without a car for my whole life   however   i can t help it   i lust after them daily   but as much as i mull it over   even if i had the money for it   an suv just seems a bit wrong   and yet now everyone makes an suv because the market for them is just that big   isn t it great that we have all this money   isn t it lovely that our country is at peace and has been for years isn t it fantastic that we can write   talk and exchange opinions with people all over the globe isn t it about time we started caring for someone besides ourselves please feel free to correct me   but it seems that suv s are a symptom of a larger problem   i don t mean to condemn anyone   i am just curious about the real causes behind this disturbing trend br br  
345,0,  be ready to spend lot s of    with today s gas prices   this vehicle is definitely a real gas guzzler   just don t know how long i can afford to keep it   several things drove me to purchase my   eddie bauer expedition   it definitely offers spacious comfort   this is definitely a plus   my kids have really enjoyed the ability of having rear control of the music and the a c   personally   i like the built in earphone jacks that the rear offers and they do use them   only kids with their short legs can really enjoy the rd seat   the rd seat is o k   for now with kids   that is   however   third seat definitely not for adults   with two different drivers in my household for this same vehicle   i have really enjoyed the feature that allows you to pre set the adjustments of the seats   mirrors   gas   amp   brake pedals using the key remote   this i really like   at first i really had a concern as to whether   i   a    quot   woman   could really handle driving a vehicle this size   with the handy step up boards and hand grips   getting on or off is not a problem at all   i was also concerned about turns and parking   again not a problem at all   over all   it is really pretty smooth to drive and handles well   with it s size i feel a great sense of safety   although an impact is an impact   i just feel it would be a bit different in comparison to the size vehicle i previously drove   it also feels great to drive up high we took our first out of town trip in it last month   i have only had it   days at that time   i must say   it s definitely much better mileage on long distance travel   the one thing we really did not prepare for was the lack of luggage space   yes   it does have an above exterior luggage rack   however   we found out at the stops along the way   we had to try to park where our vehicle would be within view   because of our luggage   even though it was tied down and pretty secured   we still felt unsure of leaving it out of sight again   this vehicle is just such a gas guzzler   i just don t know how long i can afford to keep it br br  
346,0,  i recently rented a   expedition for a weekend outing   and to road test the vehicle   there are alot of pros and cons with this suv   i currently own a   tahoe   and have not one complaint regarding the vehicle so far   it has went everywhere that i ve decided to take it   and not once has it skipped a beat in doing so   i rented this expedition to compare it to the tahoe   well   there is no comparison   the tahoe wins hands down for certain   the expedition got an average of   miles per gallon throughout the whole trip   which was   consecutive days   i got it stuck in the mud   different times   which required a tow out of the mud each time   it handles terribly on and off road   and seems to me that it is underpowered for it s size   the tahoe   on the otherhand   handles very well for a suv   will literally smoke the tires on dry pavement   and gets anywhere from   mpg to   mpg   do not get me wrong   the expedition is a very comfortable   nice riding   luxurious suv   and does have an abundance of qualities that alot of other automakers simply do not think of when manfacturing thier suv s   i feel that the expedition is suitable for the buisness executive type of consumer   that needs the four wheel drive occasionally   maybe to get to his her office in the snow safely   and get there in ultimate comfort   this vehicle is not made for the serious x nuts at all   it s simply not designed to go off road too far   and if you do   you d better have someone following you with a long tow rope br br  
347,0,   was the year that we leased the expedition from kearny mesa   and to say the least   that was the beginning of our nightmare   we got the red carpet lease   whatever the heck that means   for   years and k miles per year   we got the vehicle september th and we were so excited since its been a while since we got a new vehicle   much less an suv   the next day   me and my family when to church and was on our way home and all of a sudden   the truck made this weird sound   we thought it was the air conditioning   so we turned that off   it continued to make that irritating noise   so my husband decided to pull over to the side of the freeway   that s it   the whole truck died on us   so we had to call a towing service and had it returned to the dealership   that whole incident freaked me out to say the least   after only one day of having the truck   the next day it s back in the shop   at that point   we called the dealership and told them that we no longer wanted the truck   and the dealership said quot sorry no can do quot   to make the long story short   we got stuck with that     per month lease but we are done with it and do you think i will recommend their dealership to anyone after they screwed us big time no way and also   they should consider redesigning the front passenger seats it s way too uncomfortable br br  
348,0,  the expedition is seen as s response to the gmc suburban   i must say that i prefer the suburban to the expedition which merely seems to be a larger version of the explorer   the suburban was the original oversized suv and tried to imitate it   i think that the expedition is too big   bigger isn t always better   for one thing   it is hard to drive the expedition on narrow roads because it is so wide   you can t park in tight parking spots for the same reason   it isn t good for hauling things when it is full because there isn t enough trunk space   the seats are uncomfortable and cramped   and it is built poorly   i had neighbors who owned the expedition and they had to take it to the shop quite frequently because of one problem or another   the gas mileage isn t that great either   that thing is a gas guzzler   the expedition seems like a ploy to sell vehicles by riding the suv craze   in my opinion   you would be better off avoiding it br br  
349,0,  is that a truck or a tank   its an ok car for a big family   but has no room in the trunk for anything   its a very tiny space   also   the gas bill is very high because it has a really big tank to fill the gass   there are good things to the car though   it has a lot of room for the children and yourself   another   thing is that its a high up car if u like to be high up   the bad thing is though that it is a very big car and can put smaller cars in danger if the get in an accident   make sure you make a really good decision before you buy the car     
350,0,  what a terrible vehicle for such a price   this vehicle had nothing   but flaws and defects   it came delivered with dry ball joints   a twisted brake line   defective door gaskets   a bad door latch   rattles in the dashboard   it was in the shop more times than not and the service department could never fix it right   they were only good at making excuses for it   then of course   the truck gained a terrible vibration at k miles that couldn t be resolved   either   the tranny became noisy at k miles   the   l is truly an embarassment   significantly underpowered   this vehicle couldn t even climb some highway inclines without downshifting and significantly winding out the engine   who would ever have thought that someday one would have to pay   k or more for a     
351,0,  i have to begin with a disclaimer   there is no listing for the escort prior to    there was a mazda integration in   and all models beyond this date had significant changes in body style as well as engine specifications so some of the claims i make on this vehicle may not be valid on current models please do not rate me down for off topic   i am not very auto literate   this epinion is part of a write off dedicated to roadiem   an advisor in autos as well as a gifted writer   someone who cared about others regardless of whether he knew them or not and who recently passed   i would politely ask that if you have the urge to rate down for this reason then please don t rate it at all   any earnings from this post are for the family of roadiem i happen to own an escort gt   i sometimes wish i did not own this vehicle but i don t seem to be able to part with it   i use it to travel back and forth from work and the drive from the boise   idaho area to the portland   oregon area   primarily for the gas mileage   especially with the most recent ridiculous gas prices   i recently went to the greater portland area to visit my oldest daughter for a week end   my gas mileage was about   mpg   i had no mechanical or electrical problems   this ugly little car is eleven years old with    miles on it   i find the convenience to be traveling about four hundred miles on about     more important than how i look this model was designed and produced before the acquisition of mazda by   it is the last year that the escort was still fairly boxy in body style and attempted to be a   sports car   it is in fact rated a   sports car   for insurance purposes primarily   i was told   because it is a three door or hatchback model   also attempted to give it a sporty look by adding a pinstripe decal   tail scoop and   low profile   tires but i see no justification in labeling any car with a   cylinder engine as a   sports car and the low profile tires are far more expensive than standard tires   every time i look at it i have to fight the urge to peel the pin striping off let me tell you what i do know about the internal workings of my beasty sports car   the engine is a    litre with fuel injected cams   i have no idea what the    litre spec is saying other than engine size but i understand the fuel injected part versus carburetor function so i can say something about that   i have never had to have the injectors serviced but i do add cleaners to my gas tank every three or four months   and i don t allow the gas tank to empty farther than    tank to avoid pulling   stuff   off the bottom   i am certain this is good for any car s fuel delivery system i have already stated that the engine was   cylinder and the big disadvantage in this is it makes for a gutless ascention to higher speeds especially on any incline   gearing down can help but it is just a good idea to enter the slower lane if traveling a one lane highway when passing lanes are provided   if there has not been a passing lane for several miles and the grade has been somewhat inclined you should be able to easily spot a three mile chain of ticked off fellow motorists driving on your back bumper   it is just safer to get out of their way and look sheepish as they pass   you will be disadvantaged in an escort if you have a need for speed   declines are a different story and if you are like me by the time you have entered a declined grade you will be ready for a speed increase   control this urge within reason or you may have to explain to an officer as i did the reason you are doing   mph in a   mph zone after completing an easterly ascent into the blue mountains which is about a   mile     grade incline   my best explanation is i had to begin my ascent at   mph just to reach the top on the same day and i was just beginning to slow down mr   officer was not amused but did warn me that there were patrol cars hidden about every two miles for the rest of the mountains   about   miles   and at those speeds i could easily have to file bankruptcy by the time i reached the end of the mountain pass   so i spent the rest of the day chugging through the choke is electric and apparently suffers brain freeze if exposed to lower than freezing temperatures longer than   seconds   the engine does stall but once it has started stalling you can get another   miles or so before it refuses to run altogether   i do not travel long distance in this vehicle during the winter months   the opposing weather condition of prolonged extreme heat can result in   vapor lock   which also temporarily disables all engine functions so long travels are only smooth in moderate temperatures   while on the subject of fuel one should know that the fuel pump here is a self propelling unit actually in the gas tank and within a year of owning the car i could hear it and i am certain anyone within twenty feet can hear it as well   it is lessened by a fuller tank giving less space for the echo effect of the closed tank   this can be very annoying   my solution is to turn up the music   the stock stereo cassette player is your basic run of the mill music provider   i am not knowledgable on these systems so i won t attempt to appear that way   if i can hear the music and the words are legible i am satisfied i have had no other troubles with this vehicle engine wise except i had to replace the water pump twice so far and the alternator once   i do think that is pretty minimal for a car of eleven years   i do wonder why the clutch has held up through all these miles because this is a common source of problems with most compact cars so now i will tell you about the crawl space disguised as the interior   the color scheme is pretty boring   gray on gray   if you are in the drivers seat it does feel like the steering wheel is attempting to rest on your chest and your wearing a waist down body cast   the back support is good and i rarely have a back ache even after long drives   if you don t begin your journey with an intimate friend you may be that way at the end of the trip as there is maybe   inches between the driver and passenger seats in the front the back seats are actually roomier than the front ones if you don t count leg room and the two seats will collapse forward to make a larger trunk   they also collapse independently if you only want half of the trunk larger seat belts are in abundance with shoulder harness provided in the back seats and the annoying automatic shoulder harness in the front seats which generally scare your passenger if they are not used to them   these are very noisy and no amount of wd   decreases this   the driver harness jammed in the closed position a long time ago so i do not have to contend with it   the other problem with automatic shoulder belts is that it makes it hard to remember your lap belt which is not automatic the dash panel is easily accessible mostly because you are sitting on it   standard issue with a c included in the gt package   no extra or flashy details except the idiot light suggesting when to shift   it is my opinion that if one can not shift by engine sound or read the magical tachometer then one should probably aspire to an automatic vehicle   i tilt the steering wheel at an angle that blocks this light from my view because i find it annoying   i also wish the engine warning display included an oil pressure display   i asked a mechanic about this once and was told that if the oil can with a slashed circle illuminates on my dashboard then it is probable the block is already cracked   what the point is i don t know   i just make it a point to monitor my oil level   this car does not burn oil even now   economically a plus here is my one and only epinion on an auto   i chose to write about this auto because it is the one i know the best   we also have a full size gmc sierra   a s   king cab and a mercury villager mini van   obviously there is a clash of opinion for vehicle manufacturer choice i have pretty much stayed true to for most of my life   i suspect this is a subliminal choice as my high school boyfriend had a cherry    and it was the envy of the school   i have taken a lot of crap throughout the years   especially from my gm mate   i just remind him that the paint is not peeling off of any of my chosen vehicles and the cost to us when his fuel delivery system crashed last winter         in closing i would like to say if you are looking for a dependable commuting vehicle with good gas mileage and fair to average comfort with below average repairs and low maintenance you may want to consider an escort   remember this is an epinion on a pre   model   after that everything changed and i know nothing about that except i think the newer model escorts resemble the mazda    this car is not for the vain or the self conscious sort   i am old enough not to care   and i have more money for other things in the long run   the van is for family accommodations and the trucks are because apparently real men drive trucks     the sierra has a lift kit on it   i get in it with a rope ladder    if you are looking for durability   low maintenance and good gas mileage then i can recommend this vehicle for these purposes   would i buy it again   i don t know   when i bought it eleven years ago it was the best buy i could make with the resources i had available at that time   i don t really think it would have been my first choice if finances had been different for me then   but i have few regrets and it has certainly been a true blue friend to me for the most part thank you for reading this post   it is my first participation in a write off   the irony in this is that when i first started writing at epinions i was curious about what these write offs were   the person that i posed this question to was roadiem and his response was prompt and encouraging to join in on one   he also had comforting and supportive comments to my postings about my struggles with my eldest daughter in the past   i did not know roadiem but it was easy enough to ascertain that he was extremely devoted to his family    friends and mankind   and womankind   in general   i am saddened to hear of his passing and offer prayer for the family   my deepest sympathies to any and all affected by his journey s end on earth   i am certain he will rise to the occasion of the next journey before him others participating in this write off for roadiem are bjcuevas   naphtalia   seether   sherrylee   mattjoe viper   gollygumdrops

352,0,  i requested budget rent a car for a toyota tercel during my   days in illinois and indiana recently   but instead   ended up with a green    escort   door with   miles on the odometer   i was somewhat excited because this was like test driving a brand new car   a feat i don t perform very often   furthermore   the test drive was going to last the whole weekend b basic features   except for the automatic transmission and air conditioning   the escort i drove was barebones   that means roll up window   manual door locks   and levers and knobs to adjust the seats   no electrical assistance   the car came with an am fm radio with cassette   which helped during my daily    hours drive from monticello to indianapolis and back   i had to pull the antenna out manually   keeping with the barebones spirit of the car b interior   it took a while to get used to the seats   as i had to make several adjustments to make myself somewhat comfortable   the seats can move back   amp   forth by the lever under the front of it   and the upper portion can tilt forward and back with a rotating knob on the left   a standard way to adjust seats on most cars   i felt that the seat bottom could have used more cushion   as it is not tiltable and i didn t get enough support on my thighs   leading my hips to hurt the first   days of driving    i cured this by taking my shoes off while driving which lowered my legs   there was no remote adjust on either outside mirrors   which was just a minor inconvenience since i only had to adjust them once   the gauges on the car were very spartan   with   mph speedometer odometer   fuel gauge   temperature gauge   and warning lights   but no tachometer or oil pressure gauge   one nice feature was remote trunk opener   a yellow button underneath the steering wheel b engine transmission   the escort s overhead cam   ohc     liter engine had a lot of spunk   as i was able to drive    mph without stressing the engine   i didn t floor the accelerator much during the entire   days   the engine noise   however   was somewhat annoying   sort of a choked buzzing noise that is common with both gm   amp   s   cylinder cars   if i wanted this much noise   then i d want the engine to sound throaty   not choked   most   cylinder engines in japanese or european cars feel smoother and quieter than the escort   furthermore   my   cylinder   chevy sprint   with     miles   seems smoother and quieter the   speed automatic transmission   with overdrive   was actually pretty good   with solid shifting and timely downshifting when i passed other cars   a toyota smooth transmission would not fit well with this car   as it would contrast too much with the buzzy engine   in a way   i was happy with this   quot quasi sportiness quot   as i always knew which gear the car was in just by listening to the engine and keeping track of the distinct shifts b driving   the steering on the escort was actually very good   as it had good feedback and pointed the car where i steered   even though it s power steering    it felt more to me like it was   quot power assisted quot   i was greeted with thunderstorms every morning   but the escort felt just as solid in the rain and i felt very comfortable driving it    mph the gas mileage of the escort was actually very good   at about   mpg     gallons per   miles   this included a little stop   amp   go driving to fight traffic around indianapolis speedway b overall impression   the escort seems like a pretty good value for the money   with usable horsepower   solid handling   and great gas mileage   the car s styling is somewhat generic   and there are enough minor annoyances like difficult to adjust seats and engine noise to remind you that this is a   quot starter quot   car suited for students and budget buyers   with the focus and toyota echo in the marketplace now   it d be tough for me to recommend the escort as a new car purchase   however   time will tell if the escort will become a reliable used car   in which case i would highly recommended it for use as an inexpensive commute car like the sprint i drive     
353,0,  in    i bought my first car   and it was a   escort   i just wanted a little car to drive around town   get groceries   take my son to the doctor   etc   without having to rely on public transportation   it was a little rough around the edges    it needed a new muffler and brakes   but other than that   it was fine it was a standard transmission   and since i had never driven one before   i had to teach myself how to drive it   it wasn t that hard   and soon   i was driving it   in my opinion   like i had been driving a stick shift for years   i only had it for a few months   and then gave it to my father when i got married   my husband had a car   and my father needed a car   so i gave him mine   sadly   though   the little escort only lasted through one more cold   canadian winter   before my father sold it for junk   all in all   i didn t have too many problems with this car   but it was   years old when i got it   so it had been through it s good times   if i had to get another older car    i wouldn t get a car that s   years old    i would consider getting a   or   year old escort   it was great on gas   very economical   and an okay first car br br  
354,0,  i have owned to escort s in my life   i bought these because they were older models and very cheap   i soon found out why they were so cheap   i used my first escort   an   model   to commute over   miles to work   i found it to be very easy to drive and extremely comfortable   the problem was   that the clutch disk wore out on it   being a front wheel drive vehicle the repairs cost over    on a    part   most people prefer not to drive a standard anyway   so this won t matter to you   my biggest piece of advice for this car is don t buy a standard   the repairs are extremely difficult for the home mechanic and extremely high in a shop   secondly   i have found that the smaller    liter engine is far more fuel effecient and reliable than it s    liter counterpart   the difference in power between these two engines is practically unnoticeable   all in all a decent car   just make sure you don t pay too much br br  
355,0,  in january of   i bought a brand new   extended cab with the   quot sport quot   package   the total cost of the vehicle was around      this meant that it did not have cd   auto locks   auto windows   etc   it was is just a   quot bare bones quot   truck   it did   however   come with a free   hour roadside service package and a     rebate the first thing that i noticed about this vehicle is that it isn t designed for people of slightly above average height   being    quot   my field of view is very limited   and the vehicle is sort of cramped   but   it was all that i could afford almost immediately   my truck began to malfunction   i took it to a nearby dealer for an inspection   since i didn t buy the truck from their dealership   they didn t act as if they cared to help me with my problem   and   when i finally did get them to look at it   they said that nothing was wrong with it my main concern was   quot power surges quot   that caused my lights   radio   etc   to go on and off in a sort of   quot flicker quot   fashion   after   tries of trying to get is looked at   i was told that nothing was wrong this coming from the mechanics shortly after that   me and my father were almost killed due to their mis diagnosis   the power system totally shut down while i was on a dangerous strip of highly trafficed road   barely able to coast off the road   i was sure that we were going to die thanks to the roadside service   i was able to take the truck to the dealership   they then admitted that there was a glitch and replaced the broken part with a used part   quot remanufactured quot   is the term they used when i complained about them replacing the part with a used one   they stated that it was policy to replace electrical parts with used ones   and   i was told that no longer makes that electrical part so the only parts on the market are used when i inquired as to whether my new truck had come with used parts   i was put aside   my question was never answered   neither was a direct inquiry to ever answered now   my multi functional switch is broken   so   every time that i try to make a turn my wipers come on   but   since it takes   minutes to   hours to even talk to a customer service rep from i have yet to get it fixed trust me   my next truck will not be a   tough give me a break br br  
356,0,  i bought the cheapest american made i m a patriot   so sue me   truck i could find   and it is a with no options save the am fm stereo   which i begrudgingly accepted as far as automobiles go   i would consider myself an audiophile   and car audio is the major concern that leads me to think negatively about this particular truck   for some reason   insists on using   quot x quot   speakers in many of their light trucks   the reason this is a problem is because aftermarket   quot x quot   speakers can be hard to find   even harder to find are top quality speakers in this size arrangement   all that can be circumvented by inconveniently using the incorrect size for the available speaker mounting   of course   unless you really know what you re doing   mr   car stereo installer will charge you around    to make sizers so that they fit properly that is just the beginning of the problem   unlike many other trucks   the has almost no room underneath the seats   what this means is that   short of a minor miracle   you can t place an external amplifier anywhere but behind the seats   this arrangement creates another problem   if a subwoofer were to be installed along with that amplifier   the entire jack assembly behind the seat needs to be removed   due to this   my jack is now underneath my passenger seat   not a real problem   but lets say another amp were added for better fidelity and volume   two amps and a subwoofer enclosure are almost impossible to fit behind the seats in this narrow cab   this is where the underseat space comes into play   because with many other light pickups   an amp could be placed under either seat   facilitating greater flexability in the setup behind the seat    such as two subwoofers or a subwoofer and a pair of   quot x quot   enclosures now   i realize no car truck is perfect   however   a new car should be relatively problem free for the first year in my opinion   inside of the first   months   i experienced the following problems   straight from the dealer   the plastic molding on the right front pillar was nt installed properly   the interior light for   ironically   the lighting controls ceased functioning   the dashboard developed a persistent   and very annoying   creak   the seat developed a slight tear   and   lastly   the wheel alignment went astray to the right   the conclusion that i have to draw is that the is not the most rugged of vehicles   which is a bit disappointing   it being a truck and all   overall   the vehicle has not been a vast disappointment   the gas mileage has been right where the sticker said it should be   i have not needed to have any routine parts   such as headlights or turn signal bulbs   replaced   the suspension is a bit bumpy   but that s to be expected from a truck   the power steering works great   although   on my particular vehicle   the right tire rubs against the wheel well if the steering wheel is turned completely to the right   the manual transmission is tight   and the engine produces good pickup for a   cylinder   the tires that come standard with the vehicle are terrible on anything but dry pavement   my final analysis of the is that it is a servicable vehicle   but nothing i could find myself recommending to a friend   or waiting in anticipation to buy     
357,0,  i bought a new   four door   last day of june this year   actually it was a lease purchase type of deal   red carpet   i paid     cash down and i had a four hundred dollar discount coupon   making my total down      i noticed right away that it road walked   and didn t handle well on curves   i had traded in a little nissan and it handled like a dream on curves   with this i had to go slower than the curve sign amount of miles suggested   also every little bump in the road   the rear end would like bounce off to the right or left   road walk   and at high speeds it would feel like i was about to loose control sometimes and startle me   i convinced myself at first that it was just the difference between a big truck and a little one   then i decided i would take it in on my next days off and get it checked   since it was a fifty mile drive   i never got the chance on the way home from work one morning   i had a right rear blow out and rolled the pick up after only having it two weeks   then the air bag came out about the size of a basket ball and burst   there i was lying on the driver s side and this nasty smoke coming out of the air bag about to choke me to death   i turned off the ignition because the smoke alarmed me and i thought the thing was on fire   to make a long story short after being given the run around by rude people at the   and my insurance would not cover all the amount owed on the truck i drove an old car of my mom s for   and    months   and still no replacement   i will never consider another vehicle of any type again br br  
358,0,  sorry   lovers   maybe was good in the   s but now they have really lost it on quality   nice looking truck   maybe   but when will you get to drive it when it s always in the shop   ok here s the story   a relative ordered a   xltwd   loaded   she was so excited and she had been a faithful buyer for   years   she waited and waited and waited finally after many delays it comes in and yes   it s a nice looking truck   it has lots of features but after a couple of weeks   it s in the shop for one thing or another   she gets it out and then something else goes wrong   this goes on for months thank goodness she has more than one vehicle or she would be in bad shape    you can t always get a loaner   engine problems   wiring problems   plastic parts break off in cab   seat adjusters won t work   ok   so you say   you didn t actually own this truck   you are right   but this is not the first she has had and after awhile they start falling apart   i was a witness to this   i know that they are rated highly   but please investigate before you purchase   that is a lot of money to spend to have it in the repair shop all the time update     i have been getting a lot of feedback on this rating   but i stick to my original opinion   this truck may have been a lemon   but keep this is mind   within the first year the engine had to be replaced   wiring worked on   a c repaired door lock replaced   twice   and other miscellaneous repairs   be advised that she did buy the extended warranty and is very glad that she did   she will not be buying another truck in the future   she continues to have problems and this not even to mention the firestone tires that had to be replaced   sorry again lovers another update     ignition had to be replaced wind blows through the truck like a window is slightly cracked   but you can t seem to find out where the air leak is    a loud whistling noise   also   the tailgate is hard to latch   it doesn t seem to fit well i ve stated before that i am not the owner   thank heavens   so i don t have to worry about the expenses   but whenever i drive the vehicle   it drives fine without knowing the history of this vehicle   i would assume that it was great   so please ask questions if you consider buying one   and just to let you know   i have owned several fords in the past   both cars and trucks   and were happy with them   those were the good ole days   buyer beware it ain t like it used to be  
359,0,  i purchased my   new in june of    it was a four wheel drive flareside regular cab with the xlt and off road package   let me start off by saying that offers excellent financing   i got     they also offer competitive rebates   usually you have to choose either the rebate or the low finance rate   in addition to the affordability   i chose my truck because of its looks and style   from the day i drove off the lot i got compliments on what a   cool truck   i had   initially i was pleased with my truck   after a few months i started noticing creaks in the dash   this seemed unusual for a truck so new   i also received a recall notice from for a faulty wiper switch which if not replaced could short out the system   into i went for this problem to be fixed   a few months later my entire truck began to shake above mph   this brought me into the dealership again where after examination   they determined that it was a snapped bolt in the driveshaft assembly   this problem was fixed under warranty   but disturbed me a bit as the truck had only    miles on it   shortly after that i received a flat tire on a road going aprox   mph   after careful inspection by a mechanic   it was discovered that the tire went flat due to a faulty valve   i m glad i was only going mph gas mileage for me was slightly below the sticker   i consistently got   mph with mostly highway driving   while economy and truck do not usually go together   i was disturbed by the fact that full size chevrolets average mpg with larger engines than my   i had the    v overall i liked the truck   but not enough to keep it   rising gas prices and disappointments led me to trade my truck for a new honda   civic   see my review   that leads me to my last complaint   resale value   this truck only had    miles on it at the time of trade   i shopped numerous dealerships and looked at several different model cars   i just broke even on my balance due of aprox       this truck had a sticker price when new of       i know american cars depreciate faster than foreign models but give me a break   my truck was in showroom condition   i guess you get what you pay for my final word is if your looking for an inexpensive truck that gets you from point a to b and you can handle constant   quirks   buy a   otherwise shop around  
360,0,  right now i drive a   x x cab dr   l   but i d like to go back to my first in   when i as    new   my dad co signed for my first new truck   i bought a    standard cab x stx with one of the first push button x systems   i thought that was   way cool   back then   as far as longevity goes for this one i can t say but i know it could take a lot   being a stupid yr old kid and adding a    mi bumper to bumper that i was told would cover any thing i drove it as if i was mickey thompson   i lived to get all fours off the ground and being a yr old party animal in a rural community i found opportunity practically daily   i was by n with a friend in this truck and making those tv commercials appear tame and in the mist of roaring laughter and fast paced action my friend turns to me and says   quot next time around let me out quot   i reply   quot you scared quot   and he says   quot no i ve only seen this on tv quot   and this was daily with this truck   being reckless i totaled it with    mi on it and it never saw a shop once   that s damn good when you consider those off road racers rebuild those truck after each race   to give you the sense of reckless abandon that   yr old drove his truck with remember in   quot ferris bueller s day off quot   the parking attendants faces in the ferrai as it was flying through the air   that was the elation i experienced for    miles   my relationship with that truck is like looking back on old girlfriends from my youth   the times i had and the memories i would never want removed but i could never have that type of a relationship with a vehicle again and have never had all four off the ground with any other vehicle in my life since   by the way   to this day i still remember the salesman saying   quot you ll be a man for life quot   so far he s been right so now i go through a few used vehicle wondering if buying new is worth it new    just broke up with a girl and replace her with a truck   a little    
361,0,  i owned two   first    stx ext cab   and currently   standard cab   both wd   something has happened in those   years   first i drove for   years   ran great   wd worked well nice bucket seats   solid build   good turning radius   but a bit under powered this current beast is an entirely different animal   it began to make questionable noises within my first year of ownership   i m ft and a little too big for the interior   very uncomfortable and the seats did a number on my back then came the recalls     steering column wiper blinkers assembly    water pump    the tires   which i must ad   are horrible quality   when i did some investigating   i found even more   features now   i bet you re wondering if drive my vehicles hard   not at all   i have owned this rolling nightmare for   months   and i only have k miles on it   all of which are basic city driving to   william clay   get to work you silver spooner   you just lost another customer  
362,0,  i am a cautious driver   with fairly decent maintenance record   the truck is a fairly nice truck by looks and comfort   i got what i paid for        but   i am not impressed by the manufacturing and engineering of this     i wish would try to ensure quality in the mechanical and electrical parts of the vehicle   that is   after all   what drives the trucks   not the cushion seats and the pretty red finish   although those are nice abs   odometer   speedometer do not work   no recall for my particular vin    multi function switch does not work properly   wipers go wild   and no recall for my particular vin    tierod recently went out   upper brake lights continually go out   insistent pinging while using low mid grade gas   must use premium disgusted by the lack of recall of defective parts   not very thorough in their recalls would i buy again   only if they improve their quality standards and maintaining a good service record with owners   i e   being honest to repair defective parts fs
363,0,  what a car   i test drove one today and loved it   i was not expecting to be impressed   i was expecting to cross this vehicle off of my list of prospective purchases in the next month or so it all started when a girl in my study hall started bragging about hers   of course from here i had to make fun of it constantly   one day she had enough of it and took me for a ride    i never made fun of it again   b pros   the   thunderbird lx i test drove was definitely a well equipped car   it had power windows   door locks and mirrors that worked well   the windows came down at an average pace   this car came with a cd player from the factory in    as well as an alarm keyless entry   the keyless entry was just as good as any i ve seen from the factory   poor range   but at least it was there   the trunk release was very nice on the key ring   the trunk release in the car was kind of hard to find   but under the armrest is a nice place after you know where it is at the     l   v   with   fuel injection   put a hefty amount of power to the ground for a non turbo v in a medium weight car   i d estimate quarter mile time to be about   and    time to be about   seconds   the speedometer goes to   mph and i m certain this car could do it   it even sounded pretty nice   a little on the whiny side   but still an agressive sound the dash is well laid out with the speedometer and tachometer   the other five gauges oil pressure   temp   fuel   amperes meter   and something else i can t remember   were small and oddly placed   i have no doubt that you would get used to them quickly   though i felt like i was in the driver seat of a truck this thing was so roomy   my legs were not cramped   the seat was easily adjustable   both of my arms were rested nicely   the steering wheel had an adjustable height   which the salesman insisted i had too high   i lowered it and felt cramped   but where i initially had it   it was very nice the deep blue interior matched the sky blue exterior very nicely   the seats were plush and comfortable   the rear seat offered a lot more room than i was expecting   similar to my blazer   it felt very comfortable   it would be easy to fall asleep in the back seats   easily sitting four people comfortably   the transmission drive shaft hump and the distance the center consol came back made the center seat useless this car did not afford the gas mileage i would hope for   but the salesman insisted that it would get   mpg city   this is a decent number   especially when you can have as much fun in this car as you can   the rear wheel drive was the culprit named by the salesman in the lost gas mileage   i m not sure how this could have effected it   but he did seem to know a lot about cars handling was a dream   i was darting in and out of traffic to the dismay of the salesman   with no body roll   i took a clover leaf onramp at   mph and a car could not have been more sturdy under me   i believe with a larger engine   i easily could have gone faster and been as secure with a rear defogger and nice windshield wipers   your view would be unobstructed   for a coupe   there was a good bit of visibility both by looking back or in the mirrors   i did not check the blind spots   but they seem like it would be a very small space this is the most beautiful car ever designed   compared to this   the is a pug nosed box b neutral   my friends   turbo had automatic seatbelts   this one didn t   according to the salesman   the government had outlawed them for two reasons   first because when the died   people could not put the belt on   second because the pillar was too far forward and instead of holding someone back at the chest   it would move up to their throats   the manual safetybelts were an inconvenience   but i can definitely see their pros although the driver seat felt as though it would be comfortable for long trips   it did not offer lumbar support   a pillow would fix that problem   the headrests left something to be desired   although i m sure they could be adjusted with a bit of force to open the hood took a bit of effort   something that you would not grow accustomed to   this would only be a minor inconvenience the dealer said that you could not get fog lights for this vehicle   this disappointed me because i think it would look very aggressive with a set close to the ground   when i tried to engage the fog lights   the head light dial came apart   it was easily put back on   but it was surprising the cheap quality of the plastic b cons   these are few   the only thing i noticed was that the engine was kind of crammed into the engine bay   maintenance could be difficult   there are lots of wires running around   and other intrusive things   timing would be a breeze though   with the location of the distributor the salesman called it something else   but i can t recall the trunk space was adequate   but the seat would not fold down   the spare tire was a donut when it appeared that a full size could have fit the size of the rear tires   mm across   made it impossible to spin or even squawk the tires   admittedly   you don t need to do this   but it is always nice to be able to make some noise   perhaps in a turbo v or v version the automatic transmission was very smooth   it shifted delicately and wasn t constantly searching for the right gear   it only shifted down if i really hit the gas   i m certain a significant amount of power was lost here   my mothers blazer has a   vortec v with an automatic transmission   it will squawk the tires from a standstill   i drove an s sonoma with a    liter v with tbi throttle body injection   that yielded   hp over the vortec   the gmc was a manual and i couldn t keep the rear end on the ground   i could feel much more power being put on the ground with the manual transmission   the    t bird   does not have a manual transmission option    you can get a    t bird supercoupe with manual transmission   but with the supercharged v your insurance is going to skyrocket   i can t believe put only automatic transmissions in a car that seems like it has such sporty potential b overall   i would recommend this car to my older friends   it is a good price   lots of features   very comfortable   the power is ok and it is a gorgeous car   it is not an economy car by any means   but you ll have a lot of fun driving it i do not recommend this car to anyone that wants a sports car because you will have such a hard time regaining the performance out of it that is lost with the automatic transmission if this car came with a manual transmission   i would probably purchase one i discussed the new t bird with the sales man   he said he really liked the styling   i for one strongly disagree with s design in this new car br br  
364,0,  i owned a   thunderbird lx v for   months and here s my first impression   fun for the city   smooth on the highway   but i m not sad i sold it the engine is a low horsepower high torque v     liters with only hp   it does have   ft lbs of torque   so it pushes you back in your seat leaping from stoplight to stoplight   get it on the freeway and this big v can hardly hit    i would say acceleration is good up to    then it tapers off the build quality inside was decent very plastic looking effects and velour everywhere   it did prove very durable and quite comfortable   the seats were like barcaloungers soft and squishy   they didn t promote great posture and after long trips it made my back a bit sore the trunk was voluminous   but backseat space was pretty small   front seat room was huge   lots of room over my head the automatic transmission was one of the better ones i ve driven   always shifting at about the right spot   occasionally on the highway it would disengage gears and rev the while trying to kick down for passing speed   which was a little un nerving the stereo was horrid but very easy to replace   including the awful little speakers   this was probably the most important money i put in the car the only repair i had was when the torque converter acted up and made the car shake in rd and th gear   turns out the fluid used by was less than optimal and a change to synthetic fixed the problem   as recommended by the car did not have anti lock brakes   an airbag   or a limited slip differential   all of which were promised by the salesman   don t go to a dealer i would rate the mechanical quality of the car at good   the interior at average   i sold the car and bought an audi coupe quattro   the ownership of which i have not regretted for a moment   i will rate it   not recommended   just because i wouldn t go out of my way to drive one again it was good but there are better out there  
365,0,   it s a way of life   my wife had always wanted a so last year we bought one of the first    cobras off the truck   our cobra is a rio red coupe with medium parchment interior   i had some experiences with the mustangs of the late   s but there is no comparison   this is a true sports car   the new irs make the car handle like it is on rails   what other car can you purchase for under   k that has a hand built engine   the svt folks treat you right also   the latest gift is a leather jacket   the only negatives is the noise level inside the car   this is to be expected with a true performance car but it gets old on road trips     
366,0,  i ve had my explorer now since    it s been every where from washington dc to miami   fl   where it was purchased   to alabama and now here to sunny   yeah right   san diego   i must say that it would have been cheaper renting a car during my long travels rather then pay for the repairs on my   two months after i first purchased the vehicle   i had to call   quot road side assistance quot   because of a dead battery   when i went to the dealership to find out what was wrong with the vehicle   they told me that the battery was old   old   huh   two months is old   come to find out   the manufacture put a   battery   that was probably sitting around in some warehouse begging for a sucker   that s me   to get stuck with him   in my   vehicle   oh but the fun s only beginning my explorer     miles young needs what   you guessed it   tires   at   dollars a pop   guess ole   firestone loved that   wrong manufactures defect on the tires   the treads were separating with no signs of normal wear and tear   joyous   something free for a change    miles young ahhh   you need a new starter   we have a re call on your side mirror   something about catching on fire   blah blah blah   and low and behold   you need not only new brake pads   but the entire brake system needs replacing   for you southern californian s   i guess it s what brake depot would call a   quot break system nightmare quot   well   at least it was still under warranty   but boy are the mechanics at and i becoming close friends bare with me   quot auto experts quot   if i don t explain something adequately   you know us woman brake shoes shoulder pads   what s the difference   right smile   all right on to the    mile mark what   new tires again   and a muffler   etc   etc   and so on   seems as though the older explorer models have front alignment problems which cause the tires to wear uneven   etc   so that lifetime alignment i purchased   the up keep on the alignment   rotation   oil changes   fuel injector cleanings   etc   etc   really haven t helped much in the long run   the biggest problem with having something go wrong with your    for those of you who drive explorers   i m sure you ll agree   the explorer would not start would not start long enough for me to drive it any where it dies where it dies just the towing expenses alone would have been horrible if it hadn t been covered under my insurance on to the grand finale at    miles   still   young   i had the pleasure of experiencing a transmission failure   unfortunately i was in the process of driving when it happened       dollars to re vive my   hard parts soft parts   you name it my transmission needed it   now   i know that in order to maintain the driving performance on your vehicle   you have to service it and take care of it   but in my case   i ve basically bought enough parts to build a brand new explorer over the past   years   i know that   years seems like a long time   but the majority of this work was done during the first three years of my little guy s life   i would definitely not recommend someone purchasing an older model explorer   did i mention the fact that i ve had my tires replaced   times   i ve heard some really great stories from friends who have the newer explorers   but because of all of the problems that i ve had with this little   quot baby quot   i wo nt be trading him in for a newer model   i might just try my luck with a honda br br  
367,0,  okay   i m    and i ve been driving this death trap for   years   previously it was driven by my mother   so nothing you read is because of abuse   at least not long time abuse i have to say   anybody who says this is a good truck is so completely wrong that you might as well not read the review at all if they say so   it is an awful truck   what s wrong   hmmm   well   that begs the question   where to start handling the truck actually isn t an awful handler   but body roll is severe   and it really bucks over bumps   dive   the front end going down when braking   is terribly pronounced   squat   the front end going up under acceleration   is not bad   but that s more a factor of the anemic engine than the suspension   on road   at the speed limit   the car is adequate   however   as i had the car when i was   and stupid   i know what it will do at more than double the speed limit   and that is feel like it s going to tip   on easy or moderate off roading   the explorer is alright   however   on severe off road conditions   it falls apart   the truck bucks violently and generally feels like it s about to break performance well   the engine is a   horsepower v in a    lb   truck   it accelerates slowly from any speed   and highway merging must be done at full throttle or you risk endangering people in the right lane   i did a few mods to the truck   a   performance    ha   airbox   a dual exhaust   and a chip   i d guess it had   horsepower after all that   maybe    anyway   nothing you can do   short of an engine swap   will make it accelerate fast   even after all those mods   the thing couldn t even squeal its tires in a straight line   unless it was raining   and it s not just the engine   the brakes on this truck are awful   made even worse by a capricious abs system which will activate in the dry   going less than   mph   or not activate at   mph when it s wet and causing the car to go sideways    i could see straight ahead through the passenger side window   all in all   even if you expected a poor performing vehicle   this one sucks exterior i personally don t like the slab sided   blunt ended   aerodynamics of a brick look   but hey   that s subjective   objectively   it isn t helping fuel economy   my truck was also purple   so that may be a small factor in my point of view interior the main problem with the interior is that   like many detroit products   it isn t well built   plastics screwed onto plastics screwed onto metal is a great recipe for squeaks   and the explorer definitely evinces these   the seat belts also rattle against the doors   and almost all interior trim panels can be wiggled by hand   and mostly pried away from their mounting surfaces   the cargo pad   or whatever you want to call it   is attached by velcro to velcro fasteners which are glued onto plastic   these gave way within a few months   so now i have no cargo pad   and both passenger side air vents are broken   because couldn t be bothered to make them out of metal   so they were constructed from cheap   flimsy plastic   like most of the inside   the seats are fairly comfortable   and there s enough room for     s a stretch   and the middle rear seat absolutely sucks because of the always trying to retract lap belt that locks as tight as possible   why couldn t it be adjustable   because hates you   the mirror in the driver s side visor is also broken   because my mother put the window up when it was sticking out   that was partially her fault   but why couldn t install some sort of stop on the thing   because is run by fools reliability well   it hasn t been good   with    miles in   years   you d think the radiator wouldn t have blown   you d also think the visors wouldn t be cracked and falling down   and that the car would get better than   mpg   maybe   if i had a lighter foot   the thing always has something wrong   lately it s been the power door locks not being powered anymore   and the center console working it s way loose so i can shake it about    in either direction   this of course is another example of plastic screwed onto metal   which just destroys the plastic   giving it the play   the vacuum lines have all decayed   so they had to be replaced   the shocks were also replaced because the car was rolling   diving   and squating too much   then i realized the shocks were fine   because the new ones didn t control body motions at all misc one thing that really bugs me about the explorer is that it has absolutely almost no safety features   no airbags   no traction control   no stability control   only pre tensioning safety belts overall all in all   i hate the truck   my view is slightly skewed because my parents had mercedes   and bmws and wouldn t even buy a newer explorer   but hey   the truck really is a poor choice for anyone   please   don t get suckered into buying one  
368,0,  we   quot inherited quot   a   explorer in december of    it was great until it had about    miles on it and just stopped at a red light   it would start   but when we put it in to drive   it stalled   we had it towed to a transmission place   when we called the mechanic   he said    quot let me guess it has between     miles on it quot   we said no   that it had about     he then told us how lucky we were because we got an extra    miles out of the old transmission   he told us that he installs at least five new transmissions on explorers a week   it was a pretty good car up to that point   other than the fact that it s small engine can t go up hills very easily   we drove this car to colorado from texas and prayed the whole way   it barely made it there and back   struggling the whole way   i urge you to call a transmission shop before you buy an explorer   they will be able to tell you much better than i am     
369,0,  my husband and i bought our explorer xlt in    my husband had to have this vehicle   it was great driving it when it was new but my husband drove it mostly   until he obtained a car and we sold our other car and i now owned this explorer   at k miles i had to replace the tires   the vehicle began to shimmy and i have had the tires rotated   balanced   aligned and to no avail   i have talked to other explorer owners who have had the same problem and could not fix the problem   i have also had to replace routers every time i have had a break job done   this has been a cost of over    dollars   the passenger side rear door handle broke and will not open from the inside   again i know other explorer owners who had this problem   the computer died and had to be replaced   fortunately it was still under warranty and it didn t cost me anything   the paint on the hood of the vehicle started to crack from underneath the clearcoat   not to mention the many recalls   i also had to have the thermostat replaced because the vehicle started to run hot   replaced may batteries   have had to replace the bushings because they are located too close to the engine and this causes them to melt faster   i will be needing to replace them again soon at a cost of over    i have also had the experience of riding in an expedition and i felt the same vibration starting on it as i felt on the explorer when we bought it i feel that the expedition will have the same problems as the explorer br br  
370,0,  i bought this vehicle thinking i could take it on long trips   access remote vacationing areas   and hauling my boat   what i got was a gas guzzling snail   the explorer provides absolutely no power and is capable of nothing   while unsafe for street driving   it lacks the ground clearance for off road use   i bet i could find a ferrari with more ground clearance than that of the explorer   i bought this car fully loaded   it had the works and let me tell you about these   quot works quot   the leather is of lowest quality   it comes with air holes poked all over the seat which look very cheap   this rig is about as nimble as a    watch out for the roll factor when cornering at what you think is a reasonable speed   the explorer has an extremely high center of gravity which makes it one of the most flipped automobiles on the road today   dispite the minimal ground clearance   has found a way to still make the explorer unsafe   the constipated roar that lurkes beneath the hood is nothing but empty power   there were very few things that satisfied me about this truck     
371,0,  there s good news and bad news   first with the good news   i ve managed to squeeze out    miles from this truck and she s still running   that s more than a lot of other people can say for their vehicles   on that point i am   indeed   satisfied the bad news i ve also had quite a few problems along the way   i ll start by saying that i would be cautious about buying one of these trucks used   during my first    miles i had to have a couple of repairs done to the front axle   from about miles through        i had random problems with the electrical system that caused it to not start   i don t mind paying to get a vehicle fixed   but i absolutely can t stand being stranded by my vehicle   at    miles the manual transmission went out and that had to be replaced with a rebuilt one   this was a nightmare in and of itself   but that s another story all together   this cost about    to get fixed   luckily it was covered under an extended warranty through my insurance that was about to expire at    miles   at about    miles the x went bad so i can t use that anymore   around    miles the air conditioner went bad   not knowing how much further this vehicle would last i decided not to get the    dollar repair   had i not had those previous problems   i probably would have pitched in the    dollars to get the ac fixed   oh well   hindsight is     these are the major problems that i ve had   along the way a number of other issues have popped up as well   there was a recall on the emergency brake and there was also a recall on the rear window   additionally it seems like the plastics on the inside are really flimsy   the handle to my driver side door snapped off at about    miles and the dashboard vents to the ac have broken so that you can t adjust the direction of the airflow   the armrest that sits between the passenger and driver has even broken off   so now i just lay the arm rest where it was once secured in place   oh yes   the tape deck has always been screwy   sometimes eating my tapes   ever since about    miles on   i don t even bother with it anymore   all in all   i m glad to say that i was able to squeeze out    miles from this   and believe it or not my last    miles have been less troublesome than my first    miles   even with soooo many miles   i m hesitant to try another one of these again considering the problems it s had   since it did actually get me    miles i m giving this a   and not a lower score   good luck br br  
372,0,  if my truck had been a boat   i doubt i would have made it out of the port   i have had so many problems with my    xlt supercab   since purchasing it brand new that it s a wonder it hasn t just spontaneously combusted   but with my luck i probably would have been sitting in it if that would have happened   the funny thing is someone even tried to steal my truck back in   but they gave up pretty quick for some reason   i suspect i now know why b i note   prices in canadian dollars    b the good stuff about my truck   it s a great looking truck   when you sit and just look at it   it really looks good   too bad it doesn t do a whole lot of good for me to just sit and look at it the seats are fantastic     split bench   if there is one thing that has stood the test of time with my truck   it s the drivers seat   it is very comfortable for those long drives   my parents live   hours away from calgary   and the upholstery is quite durable   have never had any stain problems and everything is very easy to clean i tend to take a lot of stuff when i travel   the good thing about the with the extended cab is there is a lot of space   i even squeezed seven people into my truck once   not against their will power is always a plus with any truck   and mine is not too shabby in that department   with a v   l engine and   hp it has quite a bit of kick for a small truck   definitely a good thing the fuel efficiency on my truck is also not too bad   especially for a truck   i don t know exactly what it is but i can generally make it around   kms    miles   on    of a tank of gas b the forgotten realms series of fantasy books about   the time of troubles   surprisingly are not about my truck   although they could easily have been   the most defective part of my truck all these years has been the breaks   i can t get through a year without having break problems such as pulling to one side or trembling when i push on the brakes   i ve had my breaks replaced two times over the course of about    kms     miles   and the problems always seem to return   i do drive in the city a lot   but i know plenty of people with a wide variety of vehicles and models that have never had the break problems i have had   i d like to think brakes are supposed to last a little longer than    kms     miles   and not have to be constantly serviced   total brake repair costs to date     the most expensive one time problem i have had with my truck was a couple of years ago   at around    kms     miles   my truck wouldn t start a couple of times and i was informed by my mechanic i had to have my head gaskets rebuilt at a cost of over     apparently there was oil leaking from them which was causing overheating and setting off a sensor that was not allowing the engine to start   none of the other vehicles in my family have ever had head gasket problems   we all have around the same number of kms miles on our vehicles actually issued a recall of head gaskets a year or two ago on a wide range of vehicles which included some   models   but sadly the recall did not include   on the bright side   since the repairs have been done i have had no further engine problems   knock on wood shortly after my    km     miles   warranty ran out on my truck i encountered a couple of annoying problems   my headlights wouldn t turn on and my door ajar sensor would stick for up to a half hour    oh the sweet sounds of ding   ding   ding   ding for some reason one day when i went to switch my headlights to high beam the system shorted out and all i had left was the daylight driving lights   cost to repair       and then there is the door ajar sensor   i ve had to replace it twice because it kept sticking on no matter what i tried to fix it   cost to repair    around    each time   my brother s has also had this problem   although he only had to replace his sensor once in addition to these problems   i have had plenty of minor problems such as the engine mis firing at higher speeds   above   kph     mph   but most were covered by the original warranty or a recent repair warranty   this still doesn t take away from the fact i can not seem to go more than a month or two without encountering some new or repeat problem with the truck b overall opinion summary   although i m not ever planning on getting a ever   ever   ever again   i m still a fan   my family owns   vehicles and mine has been the only true dud of the batch   i really do believe i just bought the truly   horribly bad truck of the batch    so i am rating my truck   out of   overall b the non fun i ve had with my truck   not related to vehicle defects   at least directly b although some of the problems i ve had with my truck i m about to detail are crappy   they are generally   not   related to the quality of the truck or the defects i have had to deal with   i just want to illustrate the point that i honestly think my truck is cursed   anyone know a good exorcist it all started with an attempted break in while my friend and i were at a hockey game   the thief had attempted to knock out the passenger side door lock with a screw driver or something but had failed   i suspect the truck probably growled at the would be thief or something and scared him off   i swiftly responded to the attempted break in with the installation of a car alarm after shopping around for a decent price   i settled on a b sound in ne calgary for my alarm choice   i left my truck for the day and the alarm was installed   end of story   nope   i had to return   more times because the alarm did not   agree   with my truck and would false constantly   so we upgraded the alarm to try and solve the problem   end of story   nope   had to return   more times because the alarm still didn t agree with my truck   finally they figured they had the problem beat and even decided to compensate me by installing a remote car starter along with the final repairs for cost and no installation charge at     i took the deal and have never had any alarm or starter problems since thank goodness but the problems didn t end there for me   of course   the next incident i had with the truck was a near severe accident   i was driving back to calgary from visiting my parents in my home town   and while driving down the highway i watched in horror as a fully loaded dump truck ran a stop sign heading right in my path   i actually yanked the steering wheel and skidded down the highway at a   degree angle avoiding an accident   i got off the highway and the guy walked over to me and profusely apologized for   minutes while i tried to calm down   it was brutal to say the least i m not going to go into details about the next two fun events but they go like this     hit by a guy that ran a red light     damage covered by insurance     my friend and i   largely because of our silliness   got stuck under an apartment garage door while moving stuff out of his old apartment causing damage to my windshield wipers and hood    cost    the last one i m going to mention is the doozy of the whole stack   i had brake problems   as usual   back in   and took them to a local mechanic to be serviced   upon leaving i noticed my breaks were making a ton of noise so i went back only to find out they had screwed the job up   so a few hours later everything was supposed to be completely fixed   so i headed home   i was supposed to head across the city   via our major freeway   to pick up a friend after the repairs were done but he canceled at the last minute so i just headed home   thankfully upon returning home i decided to head to the nearby grocery store to grab some stuff   and when i was a few blocks away from my house   my breaks completely failed   i had none   i quickly kicked the truck into nd and st gears to slow down and coasted home   luckily there was very little traffic around at the time   what i found out when i had the truck towed to   where i had not had the repairs done at   was that someone had put oil in my master cylinder   this thing regulates the break fluid for your vehicle   i actually still have the one with the oil in it in my possession   i had service done at both and a local mechanic within a two week time period so there was no way to squarely place the blame on either one   or so i was told at this point   or probably some point long before this point   you probably asked yourself   why didn t this guy get rid of this truck a long time ago   well that s a darn good question   every time there was a problem   i basically hoped and prayed it was the last   and it just seemed like i had invested so much into the truck that it would be an even bigger waste to get rid of it now   perhaps the light at the end of the tunnel is over the past year i have had the least number of problems since i ve owned the freaking thing   a friend of mine speculated that if we poured holy water on my truck   it would probably growl at us and catch on fire or something   don t suppose anyone else out there also has a cursed b amount paid   in canadian b     
373,0,  i purchased a brand new bright red truck in november   my husband said    not another red truck   yes   i like red   and i like trucks i had brought home a darker blue truck   but it was automatic   power windows   and other frilly stuff that i didn t want or want to pay extra for   my truck had the following features   cylinder   standard transmission    speed   anti lock brakes   back sliding window   long bed   a c   power steering   and a bed liner what i liked about this truck   at the time i bought it   was that we could all fit into it   however   for my older kids   the fold down jump seats in the back section were uncomfortable on long trips   the last big trip was from tennessee to oklahoma and then back   my son at the time was   and my daughter was    they were most uncomfortable and had to take turns riding up front   and i liked the price   it cost     with all the financial stuff   this was the third vehicle that i bought at   woody anderson   in huntsville   al   and if i still lived there   i probably would have traded it there and bought another product i was faithful about regular maintenance   but this silly truck had a mind of its own   first it was the door open chime it just would not shut off   back to the dealership   it was covered under the warranty   then the wipers went off on their own back to the dealership   covered by warranty   by this time i was wondering if i had made a good decision about this truck   then the interior light would not shut off   my husband just got a potholder from the kitchen and yanked the bulb out   he was beginning to be frustrated by constant trips to the dealer for little electrical repairs i noticed a smell around    miles or so   something was hot under my truck   i took it in and asked them if there was anything under there that might get hot during driving   they checked the radiator   and other items like brakes etc but not the problem   after the big trip to oklahoma   it finally broke   and it was a carrier bearing   my mechanic basically told me that this was a design flaw since the drive shaft was not so long   it didn t really need to be built like this   just another moving part to break once all of the electrical problems were repaired and the carrier bearing was repaired   the truck was very reliable for    miles   and a trip to south carolina   myrtle beach   at that time it was traded for a much more comfortable vehicle for our growing family of    we bought a   plymouth grand voyager    van   see my review on it please my truck was not a reliable vehicle in ice it froze to the ground and we could not budge it no matter what we tried hahahhaha only in tennessee right   okay   so maybe it was built on a monday   maybe it was just that model year   but i did not buy another truck and i had owned    so maybe i ll let fords rest and get a toyota or a chevy next truck purchase  
374,0,  the early   s were good for   sales were strong   recalls were few   firestone tires were the norm and there was nothing wrong with that   by   the taurus had overtaken the honda accord as the best selling car in america   in fact it held on to the position until   when the toyota camry won the sales race   so what was it about the taurus that made it sell so well   was it the looks   the performance   the quality   the price   i had only one encounter of an older taurus before last week   a beat up   model that a friend of mine used to own   last week i got to drive a   taurus gl with only    miles   how would it compare to the last older taurus i drove powertrain   c   this taurus like so may others had the venerable    liter pushrod   vulcan   v   it was good for about   horsepower   keep in mind that the taurus was amongst the bigger midsizers of its time so it was not surprising that this    liter was not quite up to the job   this engine makes quite a lot of noise for not much grunt and it knocked pretty bad   the performance is not helped by a transmission that shifts too soon for my tastes   the shift quality is poor   either it clunks or it slips just a bit   taurus transmissions are legendary for failure and malfunction   being that this example only had    miles made all the less encouraging    update   as of august   this taurus blew its tranny with only    miles   it was soon junked   sorry it took my almost a year to inform you all of this handling steering braking   d so many family sedans of this era had started to become more engaging to drive   the nissan maxima and honda accord were the sportiest   the toyota camry was the smoothest   the mazda   and nissan altima being somewhere in between   but tuned the taurus to appeal to those who consider a car to be just an appliance   the taurus has perfectly safe handling but the driving experience is numb and devoid of any sense of fun   the steering lacks any sort of feel   it heft is completely artificial   the response is imprecise   the suspension is tuned for a smooth ride but its softness contributes to more body roll than is comfortable   the brakes are horrid   the pedal feels spongy and i had to apply way more pressure than normally do   overall   this car does not inspire any confidence interior   d the taurus was one of the bigger cars in its class   i really expected to be impressed by the interior room   but when i got behind the wheel of the taurus   i discovered that i have it made in my    mazda    my mazda was one of the smallest cars in the class back then however it has a lot more front legroom than the taurus   in this car   the wheel arches intrude exactly where i like to keep my left foot whereas my mazda has plenty of foot room   the s seats provide very little support and are not comfortable even on short trips   this gl model has a power driver s seat but surprisingly has no controls for the all important thigh support   the controls are fairly well laid out and the cupholder design is great it holds cups   too bad it blocks the low mounted stereo   which has really small buttons   the overall quality of materials is quite bad   the plastic used on the dash and door panels just screams low buck   the fabrics used are not much better   the back seat is pretty roomy but like the fronts   they offer very little comfort and support   and for you skiers out there   the seat does not fold down   thankfully the trunk is big albeit with a high liftover exterior   b   as far as looks go the older taurus was not bad   in late   when the original taurus made its debut it was cutting edge   the   restyle made it look even better and more upscale   even today it looks somewhat modern if pretty generic   it s a tried and true styling effort that certainly won t offend anybody   the same could not be said for the    fish face model   which offended many overall   d it s sad to say that the older taurus was simply not a very good car   i would like to have thought that given the low mileage it would have driven better   but in reality this babied   model drove pretty much the way my friend s old beat up   model   just as an example   my   mazda   with    miles on has not led a charmed life   it was in a major accident once   yet my   old bruiser   drives way better than the taurus   it is better built   better engineered and a whole lot more comfortable   plus its fun and has better resale value   the honda accord   nissan maxima and toyota camry are even better   so i d say skip the taurus   you ll be glad you did  
375,0,  back in    we purchased a   taurus wagon   we purchased the car because we needed a larger car for our family   the car had problems the moment we drove it off the lot   as we were driving down the expressway in our   quot new quot   car   the oxygen sensors went out   meaning the car would stall out going mph   we called the dealership   and they fixed them   assuring us that the car had been very well taken care of   and this was just a strange coincidence   well    weeks later   the brakes went out   so we got them fixed   then the head gasket went out   and now the transmission is out in it   we have only had this car for a little over   years   and we have sunk more money into it than we had to pay for it even though we had a warranty   i will make sure a mechanic checks out the next car i purchase   and i would advice anyone to do the same     
376,0,  there have been two serious problems with the taurus and sable vehicles   mainly   it s the transmission   the axod and axod e automatic transmissions   introduced in    these things have apparently been designed in haste it s noteworthy to mention that this same transmission has also been used in windstar minivans and   i think   in lincoln continental sedans axod transmissions have been used in taurus and sable vehicles from   to    an electronic version   called the axod e   have been used in the redesigned taurus and sable vehicles from   to   these transmissions have used an aluminum accumulator piston which has been known to crack   s tsb   technical service bulletin   indicates that the aluminum piston must be replaced with a steel one   when the piston goes   the car will not upshift properly   if at all these transmissions do not provide adequate lubrication to the planetaries   the planetaries are a set of orbital gears that transfers the torque from the engine to the wheels   apparently   the transmission does not distribute enough fluid to those gears that they overheat   they eventually will break down   when the planetaries go   your car will not move   if you were moving when those gears go   you will coast to a stop   this problem has also been indicated by through a tsb this vehicle has also used the essex    litre v   engine   these engines are notorious for developing problems with the head gaskets   a lot of vehicles in s lineup have used this same engine   like v   thunderbird cougar vehicles and v   mustangs   fortunately   these engines are easy to identify   just pop the hood   the intake plenum   which is a big slab of metal on top of the engine   should have this written on it in big letters      fuel injected v   there is a tsb which lists replacing the head gasket material with an   improved   version   along with replacing the head bolts with ones that have higher torsion to achieve a tighter compression of the gasket for a better seal   however   there have been reports of leaks even with the improvements   most leaks seem to occur after flushes of the cooling system s execution of recalls to affected vehicles have been less than stellar   model years covered are only   and up   owners of vehicles years   and down are not being honored   off topic   it has also been commented that has had a reputation for   lawlessness   in comparison to other american car companies in terms of responsibility to their customers in the event that a potentially dangerous design defect becomes known   has been known not to take action in face of these circumstances   the only other i can think of that is worse in this regard is kia if you want a second generation taurus   as they are the best looking tauruses in my opinion   opt for the   model as they may have the updates applied to them   also   in addition   get only a taurus or sable with the    litre vulcan engine   if you wish   get a sho model   all sho tauruses use super reliable yamaha v   engines   and some shos use manual transmissions   which avoids potential transmission problems inherent in the axod altogether   however   when something does go wrong with sho cars   they are expensive to repair if major parts are required as parts for sho vehicles can be difficult to find one way to check the transmission s condition is to check the fluid s condition   if it s cherry red   it may still be good   although the fluid could have been replaced to cover up a transmission problem   if the fluid is brown or brownish with a sharp   dirty odor   avoid the car as the transmission had been overheated   particularly a concern with cars using the axod automatic transmission check the engine s head gasket condition by checking the oil   if the oil looks murky and light brown   and can even sort of have an appearance like chocolate milk   then avoid the car as the head gaskets have leaked smell the oil   if it smells burnt   avoid the car   burnt oil usually means that the engine had been overheated   overheated engines can develop head gasket problems prematurely   and engines with head gasket concerns to begin with should be particularly avoided in this instance also   as always   try to obtain all the service papers for the car in order to ascertain how it s been taken care of   as well as to reveal if any major repairs had been done or not  
377,0,  in april    i purchased a   taurus lx wagon with the v engine   my family was growing   and i needed a larger   safer vehicle   i went the way i could afford   it was priced slightly over the blue book price   and it was super clean   the odometer read nearly    miles   but when i test drove it   the taurus wagon handled well and rode smoothly   it ran quietly   and shifted almost unnoticeably   i was impressed   as was my wife   which was very important i made a     down payment and financed the remaining     through my bank   the first monthly payment was due on june      roughly   days after the purchase was made   a couple weeks before the first monthly payment was due   i had a problem one morning while pulling out of a parking lot   the transmission slipped out of gear   and it stayed that way   the mechanic told me that when he opened it up   the case was full of shavings   totally without warning   the transmission had chewed itself up   a remanufactured transmission with a decent warranty cost me      add to that over    in labor   all for a seven year old vehicle i still owed nearly     on when interest is added also   at the consignment lot   the keyless entry code worked   a few months later it didn t   and it cost me    to get some guy with a slim jim to open the car for me     
378,0,  i have a   taurus with a v   l engine   the taurus is a nice car   it is very roomy for a family of four   there is plenty of trunk space and is a comfortable ride for family trips however   at    miles the head gasket cracked   coolant was leaking into the exhaust system causing billowing white smoke to come out of the tail pipe   i opted for a rebuilt engine as purchasing another car was out of the question as a car with a cracked head has little trade in value now   has increased the warranty for   and   taurus vehicles with   l engines to   years or    miles   according to the letter   if you have already paid to have the head gasket repaired   prior to the date of this letter   march     you may be entitled to a refund of your repair costs   obviously   has had lots of complaints and bad press concerning their   l engine   ann o neill   director of vehicle service and programs even states that   quot is committed to maintaining satisfying and and long term relationships with our valued customers   and demonstrating that commitment through actions such as this quot   i guess i am not a valued customer as told me that there is no recourse because my model year is    it is a low mileage car as it is now close to   years old with    miles of which    is on the second engine   my car clearly fit the textbook case of what they were trying to correct with   models as previous reviewers of the taurus have stated   there is no gray area with rules   only black and white with br br  
379,0,  my family had high hopes when we bought our   new   taurus from the dealer   we thought of the great trips we could it this spacious and quiet car   we learned very quickly   the car was the most unreliable thing we had ever ridden in   when we owned it we went on about six long trips with it   four of those trips it broke down   it is relatively quiet and has a decent amout of space   but those are qualities you tend to overlook as you manuver through the oveflow baggage from the small trunk in an attempt to get out of the car to examine the broken engine   actually the transmission gave us the majority of the problems   it couldn t handle long trips at all   this car is a lemon and should be avoided     
380,0,  i have the misfortune of having purchased one of these vehicles about a year and a half ago   it is a   taurus wagon   top of the line   fully loaded   black and very pretty to look at   unfortunately   i have only been able to drive the car for about    miles since i purchased it   first the steering went out     next it was the head gasket       not to mention various other minor repairs   the last tow truck driver informed me that he tows the taurus more often than any other car and the garage concurred   i was warned that the transmissions often go out in these cars and   alas   that prediction came true yesterday   i have decided to donate the car to charity   i would not recommend this car to anyone br br  
381,0,  i bought a used   taurus in    with about k miles on it   from the beginning this car was a black hole with my hard earned money   i spent almost    on this car   and have put almost    into it since   not including gasoline   oil changes   or regular maintenance   first it was the neutral positioning sensor that left me stranded on the side of the highway   that cost    for one part and   minutes of my mechanics time   then the alternator belt popped off   again leaving me on the side of the road   with about    in repairs   then   it was the radiator   the air condtioning compressor   the fuel pump   and some various gaskets   about   months after all those repairs   the spindle assembly in the front left wheel literally flew off my car while i was driving it   i ended up in a ditch   quite shaken up   but very luckily   unharmed   that cost    from a junkyard not the dealership   the dealership wanted    for that work   then   the rack went out along with the power steering pump   and the cv joints   another     i found out from my mechanic that my car was built on a friday   and that explains a lot   i say i wasted a lot of time and money on this hunk of junk and advise anybody out to buy a   or same model taurus   keep looking elsewhere   perhaps i happened to get a bad one out of all of them   but i doubt it   i wish more than anything i could turn back time and not buy a taurus   buyer beware   now i have a piece of crud that won t even get me    to put towards another car     
382,0,  this is in addition to my august th opinion regarding engine problems   which required the replacement of two engines due to head gasket problems i also noted that the transmission was replaced with k miles for    the wouldn t pay for the replacement eventhough they were aware of a   quot front piston problem quot   common with the taurus transmissions   i figured that with a new transmission   tires   engine what could go wrong   i found out today   k miles   that the transmission must be resealed due to numerous leaks eventhough it has only k miles on it   it will cost over     also have to redo the power steering also due to leaks as well as replacing the front wheel bearings   so far i have spent over    in maintenance costs to keep the car going and will probably run another    if i have the work performed   which i doubt   this has been the worst car i have ever owned and anyone who is considering purchasing a should get smart and look at other alternatives that have a much better maintenance record br br  
383,0,  i have owned a couple of these   tauruses and they are great for roadtrips and long commutes   the less options   the better   i hate the transmissions they all go out in the k range   look for slips and   quot thunks quot   mounts are weak too   especially on the   s   so don t mistake the loud thud upon accelerating with tranny problem   the starters are sketchy and these cars suck when they don t work   as you begin to realize that no one wants it   no matter for how little money if there are electrical or transmission problems   don t spend more than   for one unless the tranny s been rebuilt or replaced br br  
384,0,  first of all i love fords   i think they are good cars but the   taurus has caused us some trouble   first i bought it about   years ago   it has power everything   a good sound system   and a sunroof   but we began to have problems   the    l fuel injected v   was a poor engine for a product   we have had problems with both front and rear calibers and the whole brake system   we had to change the rotors   the calibers and of course the pads   but the back brakes were thankfully fixed for free    car x read the paper wrong   and another problem that they noticed was when the parking brake is set it hangs up on the wheel   so we don t use it seeing it s   dollars to fix   but the rotors and all costed   to fix   we have also had problems with the starter   changed once   also we have changed the engine once and replaced the mounts   the head gaskets broke and air conditioner has stopped blowing cold air    but it hasn t been checked   they were all costly   but other then that i love my taurus   it has a decent engine with good power and has a smooth ride   the stereo is great and has good bass and the sunroof is good on warm days   the seats our comfortable   with lumbar support   and power everything is good   we also have the keyless entry and the code   i like the taurus but with all the problems i would stay away from the    model and get the    model  
385,0,  i just recently bought a used   taurus   mind you   this is the first and only i have ever owned   i had the car less than three months when everything started falling apart   first the radiator goes   and then the water pump   then the driver s side mirror fell out onto the street while driving   next   a piece of the muffler falls off in my driveway   and finally   the driver s side window won t open   the rear brakes went   months after we had them fixed and to top it all off   the molding around the windows inside the car is falling off   this has happened all in one year and the car was fully inspected by my mechanic the day we bought it   which turned out as an a   inspection   so   needless to say after      later   the car is still developing things wrong or defective   not to mention a nice recall on some of the car s interior parts   which i have to have fixed   ughh   can we say headache   never will i buy a again br br  
386,0,  big mistake buying a taurus   at almost    miles the air conditioner went out   soon after that the transmission went out cost me big to get it replaced   i went w   a special kit to fix s mistake if you ask me we should all get a class action law suit against and sue them don t buy   if you bought it get rid of it soon btw i have a   toyota camry w   over    miles on it with no problem oh   and the interier is falling apart too nice power and good ride   but not worth the repairs what is the fewer than a   words junk lt paste gt big mistake buying a taurus   at almost    miles the air conditioner went out   soon after that the transmission went out cost me big to get it replaced   i went w   a special kit to fix s mistake if you ask me we should all get a class action law suit against and sue them don t buy   if you bought it get rid of it soon btw i have a toyota camry w   over    miles on it with no problem oh   and the interier is falling apart too nice power and good ride   but not worth the repairs what is the fewer than a   words junk lt paste gt br br  
387,0,  perhaps   quot junk quot   is too strong a word to describe my   taurus wagon   after scanning some of the other taurus reviews   i may be too harsh   but i honestly can not recommend this car   i realize that this is not a high priced luxury car   so i guess i can muster two stars considering the car s price range i obtained this car about three months ago   and it has about   miles   from the first day that i drove it   there was a problem with the brakes   whenever i brake the car usually pulls dramatically to the left   and sometimes it pulls to the right   like most people   i have a busy schedule during business hours   and it is not convenient for me to make an appointment with the dealer to have this fixed during work hours my next problem is the amount of road noise which gets inside the car   i rent many cars each year   and this car is definitely above average in the noise department   on a recent business excursion it was difficult for passengers in the front seat to hear passengers in the back seat and vice versa   due to the road noise   again   i realize that this is not a luxury vehicle   but i think could do better i would also like to have a larger gas tank   the sixteen gallon tank should be enlarged to a twenty gallon tank   in my opinion   my car gets about   miles per gallon   so with the amount of driving i do   i have to stop for gas about twice a week   i do not think that a larger tank would take much away from fuel efficiency   the fact that the gas gauge takes about   minutes to register after the car is filled up took some getting used to   as well there are a number of puzzling aspects about this car   for example   why isn t a third pull out seat standard in a station wagon   i know that it is my own fault for assuming that it would be   but now i am stuck with a station wagon with no third seat   also   why is the rear windshield wiper not centered   the portion of the rear windshield behind the driver is not reached by the wiper   why does the cruise control have so many buttons and require two hands to operate   i prefer the simple gm system which only requires one hand   why is the steering wheel so enormous in the center that you can not see the instrument panel when you make a turn   other vehicles manage to provide airbags without obstructing the panel view   speaking of obstructions   why is the driver s head rest so huge that you can not see around it   is it me   or is the road clearance unusually low on this vehicle by this time you are probably wondering how i wound up with this car   this is my car   and it is the only   quot choice quot   that i am given   i realize that this next annoyance may only apply to other fleet car drivers   but why does throw in a    plus engine upgrade to allow the car to run on ethanol   i live on the east coast where ethanol is not readily available   i am sure that it has to do with some sort of government quota   but i would have much rather had the extra thousand dollars put into something usable i usually like to be more upbeat when writing reviews   so i concentrated and came up with two features i like on this car   there is a nice thin shelf directly under the radio console   i also like the fact that there is a second electronic adapter for electronic devices   although this is somewhat standard now br br  
388,0,  i get my fords for free   i m an insurance adjustor with a large national insurance   they provide us with a new taurus when we hit    miles   i think this will give me an unadulterated opinion of the vehicle i ve had two so far   a   taurus gl   and a   taurus se the major problems i ve experienced with both of these cars is electrical problems   the first one was a disaster   in    miles   the car went into the shop   times for electrical problems   they ranged from interior lights that would not ever go out when the car was on   thus making it dangerous to drive at night    i had to pull the lights under the dashboard and keep the dome light off   to the power steering going out at mph right before taking a curve on the interstate   i had the power windows go out   the power locks suddenly lock or unlock as you re cruising down the street   the alternator needed a change   and i went through three computers the second one is quite minor   i currently have   miles on it   and the radio clock keeps blinking on and off as you drive   i ll have look at it next time it goes in for maintenance as far as comfort   this is an excellent car   my office is in my car   and the se package is very nice   with electric seats   lumbar support   and the remote that locks unlocks the door and opens the trunk is a nice touch    you don t need to set down all your packages   or in my case a ladder that fits in the trunk   to open the trunk    just hold it in your hand and pop it open   then set your things right in it as far as safety   being in the insurance industry and having the purchase these cars exclusively for its employees should be testimony enough    they have superb safety ratings   they hold up well in crashes   and they do a good job of protecting the passengers remember one thing though   in the purchase of a product fix or repair daily i used to think that was just a joke   however   with my experience with the taurus   that is close to true br br  
389,0,  this review is only going to cover the most annoying   quot feature quot   i have ever experienced in a car   i will mention that i love the performance and handling of this car   it s also very roomy and attractive   however   if you want a detailed review of all the aspects of the taurus   there are plenty of other reviews   just click to the next one in the category this review will simply explain why i will never own one it is my husband s car   provided for him by his   so neither of us is responsible for choosing this particular vehicle   i have been driving it for a week while he is out of town   i will be more than happy to give it back to him when he returns what is this   quot feature quot   that makes me want to drink gasoline right out of the gas tank   it s a common feature on cars today   the automatic door locking mechanism   when the car reaches   mph   the passenger doors all lock themselves i can see only the slightest   faintest benefit to this   maybe it will keep your passengers from getting yanked out of the car and mugged and beaten when you pull up to an urban stoplight next to the whores and winos who decorate the corners of your particular hometown   that s the only thing i can think of i b but i do not want a car that decides for me when the doors should be locked i b   you would not believe how often this aggravates me   any time that i get out of the car and have a need to open one of the passenger doors   i have to remember the extra step of hitting the   quot unlock quot   button    i did not   lock   the door   why should i have to remember to unlock it i   this happens nearly every time i get out of the car because i usually travel with my one year old sidekick who likes to ride in his carseat in the back   in order to get him out   i have to open the back door   seven times out of ten   i have to   try   to open the back door   then curse and re open the driver door   hit the unlock button   close the driver door and   then   open the back door the gas tank is on the passenger side   so when i m standing over there   filling up   shivering   waiting i ding i   the tank s full   i put the pump away and grab the door handle to open the passenger side door to get my purse so that i can go pay for my gas   nope   got ta trot my happy butt around the car   open the driver s side door   hit the unlock button and run back around   or crawl in and reach through to grab my purse keep in mind   the average temperature is below zero where i live this time of year   the less time that i have to spend dinkering around outside my car messing with locked doors the happier i will be   not to mention the likelihood of me hitting a patch of ice as i m scurrying back around to the driver s side to unlock the doors and winding up on my bottom so lately   i ve been speaking aloud to this car   and it ain t christmas carols i m singing when i do   another annoying   quot feature quot   i have discovered is that the car not only wants to decide when the doors should be locked   but it refuses to shut up about the seat belt   it dings every fifteen seconds if i don t fasten my seat belt   sometimes i simply do not want to wear it   okay   i m an intelligent grown up   i can calculate risk and make choices for my own personal safety   i do not need the car griping at me about it   this has only forced me to disable this safety feature by fastening the seatbelt and leaving it fastened   sitting on top of it while i drive   instead of encouraging me to be safe   this car is forcing me to be less safe in protest at the very least   should provide an option for these features   some mechanism to turn them on or off as you desire   i will never buy a taurus or any other car with these aggressive features   i do not want my car telling me what to do br br  
390,0,  this car defines average   there s a reason why it s one of the most widely used cars for fleets   skim the other reviews and see how many of these people actually own one of these cars   fleet managers love this car because it is well rated in crash tests   rather reliable and doesn t inspire illegal   surges   in speed   my   is also a fleet vehicle   ours is the second it has served   hp took delivery of this car first   now don t get me wrong   i d have driven a used yugo if the determined that was what they wanted me to have   i m grateful that we went to a medium sized car   but i do have a few complaints   not as many as i d have if i were forced to drive a used yugo   the initial visit to the local dealer was interesting   they pulled the service history from their computers and found they had about a dozen recall actions to perform   oh   things like the fuel pump   pedals too close together   windshield wipers   alternator a whole range of things   i admire for fixing all these things for free   but did microsoft purchase them   perhaps the taurus   it goes through a complete makeover every couple of years   uses the summer intern design teams   i received the car with around    miles   i m not certain why hp got rid of it so early but i ve a few ideas   at about    now   the leak started about    miles ago   oil is leaking from somewhere in the vicinity of the passenger s side headlight   i ve a slick in my garage to show for it   no one seems to know what it is that is leaking there   it started with an odor of burning oil   no clue and policy seems to be to leave the car alone unless it s something affecting safety   uh kay   the ride around town is fine   stiff enough to give the impression someone on the car s design team knew someone who was once hooked up with someone who designs sports cars   perhaps with a designer on the design team   power is decent but not inspiring   i drive this car up to   miles per month as a salesman for a relatively small   long drives to various prospects and clients scattered about iowa are made less comfortable by that stiff suspension   you can count expansion joints in the road through the seat   steering wheel   pedals   etc   frost heaves are another thing entirely   for the     the paid for this car i could have bought sorry   off topic handling is also good in the sense that when you turn the wheel to the left the car agrees that is a good direction to go and doesn t fight you in doing it   it is good to obey the posted curve speeds as the tires protest too much if speeds are pushed   the side bolsters on the seats are enough to keep you from finding too many alternate pressure points on your gluteus   and padding thereof   but not enough to keep you firmly centered under hard cornering   the dead pedal is where you d expect it to be if your vehicle is so small as to have the front wheel wells encroach on the passenger cabin   the upholstery is light gray   stone   perhaps medium vanilla gray is the best description   the dashboard is laid out fairly well but i think the tachometer was put there to aesthetically balance the speedometer   there are also many   decorative   little nooks and ledges to gather extra road dust   the blower knob no longer sticks where it is supposed to stick   it makes occasional lunges for freedom managing to get as far as the floor   rolling about as far as the center of the driver s seat   it eludes a casual reach so i ve to stop and fish it out to readjust the blower   i d much rather have a thermostat but i guess taurus drivers aren t sophisticated enough for that sort of feature   hp cars have an option that wasn t available to the general public   or so i ve read   the center console can be folded up under the center armrest   i guess so you can have someone in the front as well as the back sit on the nearly rock solid center and   in the front   almost on the driver s lap   anyway   when this is down you ve two decent cup holders and a place to mount and connect a cell phone   while connected the phone charges its battery    makes use of the car s external cell phone antenna   to answer you press a button above the rear view mirror   the stereo then cuts off and you hear the conversation over the car s audio system   neat   but the little cradle to hold your cell phone is    and specific to each brand   not that neat   i ll stick to my jabbra   normally   according to the owner s manual   where the cell phone mounts in this car is another bin   the center bin is a nice place to keep tapes    whatever other little items you need to keep close at hand while driving   it also collects stray potato chip crumbs   peanut m ms   etc   bins are also built into all the doors   you ve also got the large    deep pockets on the front seat backs that are good for holding marketing material   i m not certain what the rest of you use these for   the glove is of the bin variety tipping out at the top   versus tipping out at the bottom and dumping the contents onto the floor   anyway   it manages to hold the manuals   a bottle of tylenol   an economy size of tums and some extra pens   full at that point and difficult to close   i prefer the old style where the glove was fixed with a door rather than this tipping bin   there is an extra power port just to the right of the ashtray   the lighter is directly above and to the right of a totally worthless cubby   perhaps an engineer designed this   as that matching doesn t really make sense to me   a lowly salesman   about that cubby   nothing seems to stay within other than items too small to make it worthwhile   i have a picture of my wife    i in there now   under extreme conditions even the picture slides out   cell phone   forget it   just backing out of the drive way sends it skipping to the floor   with two power points i can plug in my phone and my vibrating seat cushion    i do like gadgets that work   i keep business cards in the ashtray   headroom is very good    even with my seat cushion    in the driver s seat   i haven t spent too much time in the back seat   if that is good or bad you tell me   the general consensus though is that the back seat is a bit cramped   i drove three staff members of a prospective client four hours one way   and back again   and didn t anesthetize the two in the back sufficiently   combine that with my testosterone induced marathon driving style and i really don t need to tell you we didn t get the business   next time i ll rent a van or luxury car    perhaps with a wet bar   one interesting feature is the pedal adjustment     i believe   developed this for those of you who need the seat all the way back to fit behind the steering wheel but then can t reach the pedals   the car has a switch on the left of the driver s seat that runs a that moves the pedal assembly closer or further depending upon your starting point and the direction you push the switch   duh   it has quite a range of motion   i ve a    inseam and have never had a desire to move the pedals beyond the hour i first brought this car home   this is a gadget i ve no use for   perhaps it was intended for the one million chimps typing randomly on typewriters to get to work    long arms and short legs   i do like the stereo   for some reason it is able to pull radio stations in for some distance further than my gm cars normally have   beyond that it is also rather average for sound   the bass doesn t thump   this car also doesn t have the available cd changer   when the cd button is pressed on the stereo the display scrolls   no dj   bless his heart   isn t that just cute   whatever   the interior sound level is rather nice   no squeaks or rattles to mention   those are the kind of things that some members of society put other people in the trunk to check for   normally people who owe them large sums of money   they then drive to a remote location and ask them if they heard the rattle too   when they blubber incoherently the driver understandably gets mad and   sorry   off topic again   i also like the key fob remote    very nice gadget   press the unlock button once and the driver s door unlocks   twice and all the doors unlock   trunk release is very nice when running out to grab this or that   why do these things occasionally have an   emergency   button   i ve noticed them on    chrysler products   key fobs   how many of you accidentally hit it when your neighbor is checking out your car in the driveway while you re inside the house   can i see some hands   it only works to test the bladder once   the trunk is big enough to swallow most of what i need to carry   you can fold the rear seats down to give you   more room   but it has to be very narrow and short   skis would fit as well as extra long golf clubs   i don t have either   that s about all that feature is good for except maybe if someone were to carry    boards home from the lumberyard   i guess if you need to carry up to four     x   pieces of lumber at a time this would be a good feature   understand that these boards would selfishly hog all your armrest   too   they d also make quite a mark on the dash if you were to run into something the spare is of the doughnut variety and located under the floor of the trunk   normally you don t need to access that too often   but i ve had to   twice   praise the lord   both days were otherwise pleasant enough that it wasn t a huge chore   however   there is a six foot long bolt holding the spare in place   okay   perhaps more like six inches   i normally don t exaggerate length   but it feels much longer while bent awkwardly into the trunk with demo cases scattered behind me   that s the other thing   i didn t care to have the flat in contact with anything that was in the trunk and the donut hole   is that what you d call that   isn t large enough to store a full size flat   fortunately all that was on the tire was black brake dust and road grime   it s not like i m herding horses with it or anything   i wrapped the tire in the blanket i keep in the trunk for emergencies   great   now i ve got black brake dust on my emergency blanket   one occasion that prompted a tire change was when i hit a rather nasty pothole and actually punctured the aluminum rim   not just a bend   it actually tore a hole in it and air was leaking not just from the tire bead but also from the rim   the tire had also had a bad day understand   but not near as bad as that rim   anyway   i was amazed and began to wonder what a replacement might cost         no      that s    for the set of four   i could get a very fancy set on e bay for okay   back to topic   the garage admitted that the aluminum rims are rather soft and that s not as uncommon as i would have thought   you know   i didn t even get to keep the old rim   that would have been quite a chunk of aluminum to bring in for scrap   i could have defrayed the cost a bit   eh   oh   topic   topic   an area most manufacturers cut weight now is on the brake rotors   someone at hp either rode the brake a great deal or that pothole also bent the rotor   i ve a really nasty shimmy shake when braking hard from interstate speeds   not enough to be dangerous of course   but extremely annoying   fuel economy is disappointing   i d assume and be incorrect that this medium sized car would get better fuel economy than my land yacht    buick roadmaster   taurus   highway    city   roadmaster   highway    city   if the difference in comfort weren t so extreme it wouldn t bother me as much   this is also the evo model engine   it will run happily on   environmentally friendly fuels   i ve only seen one station with a    ethanol option and that is about four hours north   i d have expected it to run better on the alternative fuel   but it got the same mileage on the slightly more expensive fuel   the paint   white of course   and exterior finish are well done   i ve noted earlier models that took a bad primer coat and most of the paint has flaked off the hood and roof of the cars   seems to have fixed that issue   i guess what this comes down to is that the taurus has some design and mechanical quirks without the redeeming factors some other cars possess   if your ferrari has a stiff ride   you know it s because it s a sports car   if your old vw microbus leaks a bit of oil from strange places   you accept that as part of the vintage   but this   for me anyway   is just too vanilla a car   update   dec     okay folks   as mentioned above this vehicle has the adjustable pedals   fine   there is a solenoid on the brake pedal that tells the car when the pedal is depressed   presumably so it can administer valium   why this is engineered this way is a mystery   but to save thousands of dollars in wire over the manufacturing life of the car the two wires that connect to the pedal are just barely long enough to reach that solenoid when the pedals are set all the way forward to the firewall   when you push the brake pedal when it is set in that far   forward   position   i ve a    inseam   those wires bend at the solenoid   are you following this   over time copper loses strength when bent back    forth   back    forth     keep that in mind   i was purchasing food at a local quick service restaurant sitting in front of their drive up window   i d put the car into park as it was taking some time to harvest the potatoes for the fries and kill the chicken to prepare my sandwich   yes   it took that long   when i went to leave i moved to pull the stalk into the drive position   but   since you need to depress the brake pedal to shift the transmission from park to another selection   really not a bad idea   and the aforementioned weakness of copper had resulted in an electrical fault that resulted in the car not being able to know when the brake was depressed   incidentally   this also handles all the brake lights as well   so   the solenoid no longer was connected to the rest of the system that un locks the transmission stalk   i can t even get into neutral to push it out of the way of the other folks who want to purchase food as well   did i mention that it was    pm   so   it takes   minutes to figure out that i will not be able to muscle this into drive or at least neutral   the store manager is leaning out the window making suggestions   nothing i tried would work   i called my personal mechanic   he d never heard of this happening   we didn t know the solenoid was disconnected   ever   i called a tow    waited for   minutes   now it s around    pm   did i mention it was friday night   and the tow truck is trying to hook up to the car   he s never heard of such a thing as this before either   in the wait i ve discovered the wire has disconnected from the solenoid   i ve the tow truck driver hold a flashlight while i attempt to reconnect the wire to the solenoid   in a short time i also discover that the wire is a bit short   i figure this out by reversing my seating position in the car   my feet are up by the ceiling and my arms and head are wedged into the foot well   i manage to push the wire into the solenoid and un wedge myself   still doesn t work   the tow truck drops my car at my mechanic s garage   he waited for me to get there   fortunately i ve a good relationship with my mechanic    he s able to squeeze this little project in the next day   he added two inches to both wires   the second wire was about ready to go as well   and now there s a little slack to the wires so they re not strained to the limit   have i mentioned my food was cold  
391,0,  i have owner a taurus v dohc six seater option   it now has   miles on it and is three months old   overall i love the vehicle   my previous care was a   explorer xlt with     that truck made me a believer in american cars again and the taurus is no let down   here are the ten best and ten worst that i think about my   taurus ten best   excellent ergonomic design   great options   i e   six vs   five seater   free leather   engine types   very comfortable ride   low road noise from the inside cabin   unnoticeable gear shifting   low maintenance costs   i e     mile tune up   great highway mileage   i get   mpg   enormous trunk space   easy to drive   spacious passenger cabin ten worst   low city mileage    mpg   not much color combination selection   interior and exterior combinations   floor mats are ordinary   looks like they got bought in pep boys   not very good road handling at high speeds   believe me i know   braking is average   cruise control is a little clumsy   takes time to adjust to cruise final speed   radio reception below par   standard audio package   closing the trunk require much force   no ceiling handles for passengers   japanese car owners know what i mean   slow pick up for the dohc v v br br  
392,0,  i have had the opportunity to drive several tauruses through business travel   i have driven both the   taurus se and the   taurus se first off   i have to admit that i am not a fan and am not in the market for a sedan such as the taurus   but i have to say that the taurus would be a decent family car for those who would like to get a decently equipped car for around   k b exterior   the design folks at have obviously realized what an   oval all   disaster the last generation of tauruses were   the oval shape was everywhere   from the headlights   the taillights   the grill and even the rear window   for    the taurus has moved away from the radical oval design in favor of a some sharper angles which give the car a more elegant look   most importantly   the ugly mass of oval rear lights have disappeared   being replaced by some simple angular tail lights b interior   gone as well inside the car   thankfully   is the large oval climate control    radio combination   still misses the mark by providing a   though more attractive   single unit climate control    radio center   the seats are your typical american car softer and ample sized seats   the power driver s seat allows a good driving position to be found   the rear seats appear to provide plenty of seating space for three adults   including decent leg room   the one interior fixture in the car that i absolutely disliked was the center armrest seat console combination   i just believe that there is no such thing as a true three passenger front seating area   unless maybe you are driving a   cadillac eldorado or something   and feel that most car companies do a lousy job at attempting to do so   the largest person that could sit comfortably in this space is about a five year old child   the storage console is one like those overstuffed sectional couches with fold down cupholders   i imagine those who own those type of couches would appreciate this feature in this car   other than that   the car is well equipped with power windows and door locks   cruise control and a neat control that allows you to adjust the pedals forward and backwards   which is good for really short drivers   my overall impression of the interior was that it had a really sort of modular plastic feel to it   there were places where plastic switch plates were placed on top of the plastic door panels   rather than having the pieces fit together nicely with a minimal seam   but   for k   i don t think that there is much to complain about b driving   i wasn t really impressed driving this car   sure   it is relatively quiet on the road and the car eats up imperfections in the road   but it is just not a fun car to drive   but i suppose those who are buying this car are less concerned about this   i though that the   model felt more powerful than the   model   the   model seemed a little sluggish with the standard v engine   i have learned that car manufacturers don t offer bigger engines for no reason at all   if you have the extra cash   opt   for the larger v engine   since this car seems to have been designed with a more comfortable ride in mind   the car handles with a bit of a bloated feeling   especially on freeway on and off ramps b summary   i personally wouldn t buy this car   but like i said   i m not in the market for this type of car   and if i was   i would rather shell out a few thousand more for the vw passat    sorry   i am a vw fan   it just doesn t have anything about it that makes me want to buy it   but the rental car agencies seem to like them and there are plenty of them on the road   so some people must like what has turned out with the taurus   but if you are looking for just a plain old family car   one that has a good safety rating and is decently equipped for around   k   check out your local dealer br br  
393,0,  if you love american vehicles   beware   i   personally   don t care for them   i find japanese and german automobiles to have better service records   more style   and an overall better feel to them   when renting a car for the purpose of travel   however   an american car is most often the only option   so when i traveled to connecticut for a week   i had a choice to rent a explorer or taurus i chose the taurus   i wish i had chosen the explorer i disliked the car from the moment i sat down inside of it   the seats were so uncomfortable   to help illustrate how uncomfortable it was let me paint a picture   my cousin has an old sleeper sofa with flat   worn out cushions   to keep people from sinking to the floor when sitting on the sofa   she has a piece of ply board between the cushions   and you really feel like you are sitting on a piece of thinly padded ply board   that s what the seats in the taurus felt like   i can t even imagine taking a long road trip in this car let me know when you plan to arrive   and i ll fly out and meet you   i also felt like i was sitting too high up for a sedan   and no matter how much adjusting i did to the seat   i just couldn t get comfortable   the ignition was hidden so far under the steering wheel that it required me to do a deep side stretch just to start the car   and the console controls   i e   radio   a c   defrost   etc   are so far away from the driver   that unless you have the wingspan of an albatross   some major leaning is involved just to find a good song on the radio speaking of the radio   i had to turn it up really loud to drown out the loud interior noise   acceleration sounded like the takeoff in an airplane   now if someone would serve me a light snack and a beverage of my choice while driving to the grocery store i wouldn t mind it so much   but they don t   so i would rather do without so much noise and this tank of a car skids on the snow   even with all weather snow tires   that was a major disappointment since i sprang for a larger car knowing that i would likely be driving in snowy conditions   the heater took forever to heat up   and the rear defrost took even longer the only positive thing was the roomy interior and trunk   if you plan on taking a driving vacation and want to bring a lot of people and luggage   this is the car for you   but keep in mind they will have plenty of elbow and leg room   it s just that their butts will be sore numb from the horribly uncomfortable seats   if after all of this you decide to buy one of these vehicles   i wish you all the luck in the world   that and a good seat cushion   you ll need both br br  
394,0,  i had a red   taurus ses as a loaner car for almost   weeks   i put almost   miles on it in a combination of city driving and long trips   overall i was mostly disappointed with s family sedan   but it did have some good points i should mention pros it was bigger than most   if not all   of the cars in it s class   such as a accord or camry   i m over   feet tall   and i had plenty of room up front and so did people in the back   even with my seat all the way back   the only car in this class that has as much room is the chevy impala    which is an incredibly ugly car by the way the trunk was very large and easily held luggage for    compared to other rental cars i have had   such as a mazda    the taurus was much better for long trips the steering was great   it was the perfect balance of being communicative yet comfortable   not as sporty as a focus or a   but certainly not a boat on wheels like a crown victoria or an impala didn t attract attention   i have been known to exceed the speed limit   once in a great while   and i think a taurus is just about as anonymous as you can get in terms of attention from the police ok now for the things i didn t like interior materials   although the design was ergonomic enough   the dash had too much hard plastic and the switchgear felt like it came from an econobox   i think my focus has a better quality interior   also the steering wheel on the taurus is ugly seats   the seats were flat and uncomfortable   i did have the bench seat up front   and so i would hope that a model with bucket seats would be better   the car had that   fake leather   on the seats that looks nice for about    miles then starts to look like the plastic you would find the the backseat of a cab noise   there was too much wind   engine   and tire noise   for a car that claims was designed in a wind tunnel there is way too much wind noise coming off the side mirrors   i suspect the door seams are sub par   the engine did not sound nearly as refined as you would hear in a v accord or camry   and when you put your foot down it sounded like it was going to crash through the firewall and end up in your lap   the taurus i drove had the upgraded engine   and i would hate to think what an owner of a base model would have to put up with on a daily basis radio    the radio reception was terrible and the speakers were the kind you would buy off the sale rack at walmart a taurus has the stigma of being rental and a loaner car   it has no personality whatsoever   nor does it have the quality and reliability you would find in a toyota   honda   mazda   or even a nissan or a mitsubishi don t get me wrong   i am sure there are tens of thousands of taurus owners who love their cars and are perfectly happy with them   but if you are looking for a car with some character and even a mildly engaging driving experience you are better off in something else   you might pay a little more if you want the same options but it s worth it in the long run   not to mention resale value  
395,0,  buying a taurus from a used car dealer can be a good thing it can also be your worst nightmare   buying a   vehicle like the taurus that was purchased with    miles attached to it by   my first question would have been whether or not these miles where highway or city or a combo   i m going to bet you the dealer lied   keep in mind that most used car dealerships buy their cars from auctions at a reasonably lower cost than anyone will purchase them   the warranty is there as a convienence to the customer and the dealers   the dealers can and will set up vehicles to last just long enough   something as simple as a oxygen sensor will in most cases be overlooked or simply pulled   cleaned   and reinstalled along with other things   yes it does have room to breathe and the seats are comfortable but room and comfort won t get you where you want to go   be careful to find the best dealers look for bad and good track records watch out for the quick sell   a vehicle that won t go over mph without dying on you would not be in my driveway   i totally agree with anyone who hates their taurus   a friend of ours had one   it lasted one year   yes they put more money into this car then what it was worth   the worst mistake they ever did   by the way they no longer have it br br  
396,0,  i had a rental taurus a few weeks ago   i had reserved a pickup   but the didn t have any in   so they gave me a new taurus   i thought i was getting a deal   but i sure was wrong   ironically   the rental agent said to me    quot i m giving you a new taurus   since you have the two babies   i wouldn t want a car to break down on you quot   an omen the car was fine for the first few days   save the awkward placement of the controls and the layout of the interior in general that one comes to expect with most american nameplate autos it wasn t until a rainy afternoon when the car left my wife sit at some train station outside boston   wouldn t start   wouldn t turn over   totally dead   the tow truck driver   whom i got to spend about three and a half hours of quality time with as we made our way to the rental car facility at logan airport   suspected the car failed because it was   quot wet quot i ve never liked fords   and i used to own one that was an absolute piece of junk   needless to say   this taurus hasn t changed my opinion so for your own sake   don t buy this car   test drive a nice honda   nissan   vw   or toyota   sure they cost more   but you can drive them when its raining br br  
397,0,  i have always hated fords except for the explorer which is an amazing car   but i absolutely hate the taurus so much   it is a waste of room on the highway   and it baffles me why people buy this car   it always falling apart like a typical sedan does   who in the right mind would buy this piece of junk no i really hate this car   it has no positive feature to it   and to top it off   it is one of the number one selling cars in the country   believe it or not   i do nt believe it but it s actually true   i hate fords   i hate them so much   they are terrible cars   do nt buy them br br  
398,0,  i got my new   blue   yk taurus only   short days ago   my previous vehicle was a red   taurus with which i was delighted   now   i am not delighted   while traveling at the speed limit of mph   on the interstate in my new vehicle   cruise control on for ticket prevention   i felt a strong jolt and looked in my rear view mirror because i thought i must have run over something   there was no dead animal   ladder   or d o t   worker lying in my wake   my car was rapidly losing speed   and i turned on the emergency flashers as i made my way to the side of the road   there was sudden apparence that my new   day old taurus had decided to chew its transmission into powder   and refuse to move   roadside assistance was very nice   and the tow truck arrived after dark   the mortally wounded bull was towed to a dealership other than the one where it was born   the surrogate dealership was not excited to see the tag of the other dealer still on the back of the vehicle   to say they were less than kind would be an understatement   the made it clear   up front   they would get right to work   in three or four days   if they had time   the new taurus is a louder ride   with stiffer seats   and in my case   a very unsatisfactory transmission   and that s no bull     
399,0,  i recently was given a taurus to drive as my car until my official car comes in   look for my review of that car when it comes in    either a grand marquis   a crown vic or a mercury sable ls anyway   i have been driving this for about a month   its an ok car   but i wouldn t buy it   the interior is nice enough   but it is already beginning to show wear   the seats are comfortable and adjust well   but are nothing great the back seats fold down very easily   this provides plenty of room for me to lie my bike in without having to remove the wheels one annoying thing about the car is that the power locks only automatically unlock the front drivers   door via the factory remote   you have to hit the unlock button   or   times to trigger all the doors to unlock   so if you are driving   park it and turn off the car   when you step out of the driver door all other doors stay locked   some people may like this   but it really annoys me as for fuel economy    not   this thing seems to suck down the gas faster than either my jag or runner   the car i was given is a very nice shade of blue and   as far as wagons are concerned   the shape is nice driving the car is easy and it handles fairly well   overall   it is a fair car   nothing great   but not bad either  
400,0,  kinda like the girl in pretty woman   good looking   but pretty darn unrefined face it   the old taurus was butt ugly   the front lights looked utterly bug like   and the dashboard was so   revolutionary   it was confusing   the new taurus remedies some of the problems of the old one   as the dashboard is pretty straghtforward   and the body   while not a knockout   is far better looking than the old one   while the car feels solid   at least the doors   the body panelling just has a thin look to it   maybe from cheaper than average paint   and while the dash is far less cluttered than before   one has to think about the designers who thought that rubber plastic looks good   and the little tv style volume markers on the lcd display   i mean   if it sounds loud enough for you   who cares about the little markers when i first got behind the wheel of the taurus   the steering wheel struck me as a little odd   its smaller than the average steering wheel   by maybe about two inches in diameter   my hands felt closer together than normal on this steering wheel   and while it did nothing to detract from driving it   it was disconcerting at first   the wheel might have been designed for those with smaller hands in mind   but it works for the bigger handed among us too the car does not seem underpowered   but one would not get that impression by listening to the transmission   which is loud   rough   and shifts very loudly   especially when starting up from a red light   when you floor the gas pedal   the transmission will suddenly shift down to first or second   and it makes the entire front of the car very   very   loud as it reaches and passes the   rpm mark   fortunately   this only lasts a few seconds   however   regular shifting is also quite loud   at least it doesn t shift very much on highway driving   and it rarely   hunts   on winding   hilly   country roads the front seats are comfy   and the footrest is placed just about right for my length of feet and legs   the rear seats are more cramped than other cars in it s class   and they could be less angled   at least in my opinion   the trunk is not small   however it is a tad shallow the pillars behind the rear seat are kinda wide   so backing up is a slight chore if you have to look to the side   for kids   for example   also   the brake light hump is incredibly large   and it not only takes up a lot of space in the rear view mirror   but it also covers up a lot of the trunk area   so that it is hard to see the edge f the trunk when you look through the rearview mirror   so it is difficult to judge the length of the rear of the car another unrefined part of this car would be the brakes   these brakes don t kick in until the pedal is most of the way down   and the brakes gradually get stronger so that they are grabby only at the end of the pedal stroke   and even to just slow the car down   the pedal should be pushed nearly all the way to the bottom of the stroke b the verdict b this car   while not bad   isn t up to the competition   the camry is a much smoother driver   as is the accord   however   if you are a die hard american car owner   than this is probably the car for you   whil it might not match the import competition   this car is in many ways still far better than it s chevy and buick competition  
401,0,  let me start out by saying that i own a   escort dx   see my review   that that particular car gets great mileage it s only a   cylinder   but considering everything it s been a great car and it s held together very well for all the miles that i have put on it   not to mention the fact that it is a   fix or replace daily   now on to the   taurus   i happen to work for local government    i operate this vehicle in the capacity of my job duties   and let me tell you that the   taurus sucks   first of all it get lousy gas mileage   it has no real power despite being a   cylinder car   my little   cylinder seems and feels escort has more power and quicker reaction than this vehicle   i mean i have to put the pedal to the floor to get any real reaction out of this car and then reaction is slow and jerky   the brakes are noisy     not because the brakes need to be repaired it s just that the car just makes a lot of noise   the body and the look and the feel of this car is just yucky   it s very noisy   here s something positive that i can say about this car   it holds the road well   and the seats are sort of comfortable   so i wouldn t say that i would not totally not recommend this car   but i would say buyer beware  
402,0,  this vehicle was a nightmare   my wife and i bought this car in june and it is falling apart   so far   now at   miles   the following has had to be replaced wheel bearings wheel mount struts fuel pump brake rotors and pads they have also worked on the driver s side window mechanism and the engine   the car still makes the rotational grinding noise and popping when in a turn or over a bump   we bought this to replace an older car so we would spend less time in the service department   but look what happened   save your time and money and purchase any car that is not made here in the us   our quality of workmanship is horrible in us factories   caveat emptor   
403,0,  i would have to agree that the ownership of the taurus was not much fun   i had one for a few years and rarely drove it   yes   it was a comfortable car   but it had so much problems   i ll tell you what kinds of headaches this car has caused   until it s ultimate death at just a little over    miles   i ve had the front brake rotors replaced twice   an engine that overheated   times   electrical shortages   a whining and moaning steering rack   and the unbelievable   the subframe on which the engine is assembled fell to the ground   of all the monstrosities of owning an unreliable vehicle   as my brother was driving it one day   he noticed that the steering locked while in motion   he hit a pothole and discovered that the engine suddenly fell on to ground   i ve never heard of such a thing   it really did happen   being already out of warranty   we went to a local dealer to see if this is normal   it turns out there was a recall on the subframe connectors or mounts   they fixed it for free   minus a   quot metallica quot   cd one of the mechanics decides to steal from the back seat   i couldn t prove it   after a while   the taurus developed this engine surge at all rests   either at a light or stop sign with the brake pedal applied   it was unexplainable to a mechanic   so we tried to live with it   eventually   the surges would increase in intensity and eventually stall the   it s eventual demise came when i took a road trip to florida from ny   on my way back to ny   it decided to finally die   the transmission blew at    in the middle of virginia   in the meantime   my brother and i had to hitch a ride back to the ny   not much fun     
404,0,  i purchased an   taurus new because i fell for the hype   quot best selling car in american quot   that doesn t mean a thing except a lot of people were deceived by the numbers   i ve had expensive repairs all along and visited web sites that say knew of the bad transmission   just spent     for a rebuilt one   months ago   when they were building the car   they even have a site with a lawyer suing the   there are many   many people like me   now i am faced with another     to fix the head gasket valve and engine mounts   i want another car but can only spend     for a used car   don t talk yourself into a car before you do your homework and be practical about the car br br  
405,0,  i personally do not own this vehicle   but my in laws do   after listening to all the complaints about this truck that my in laws have   i felt compelled to write an epinion about it   my in laws do not reside in any one state   they are constantly travelling   so they accumulate   many   miles on their vehicles   keep in mind that this truck has not been in the shop only in utah   but in several states   sometimes more than once in the same state   the following review will be based on my father in laws opinions and experience with his   f crew cab dual wheel lariat    written in question and answer form dndnkidz    quot why did you purchase this particular truck   the f crew cab dual wheel lariat   father in law fil from here on out    quot we bought the because it was the only truck that met all the specifications we were looking for   including full size rear doors   we ve never had any trouble with any of the other vehicles we ve ever owned   and figured we would not have any problems with the   f crew cab dual wheel lariat   quot dndnkidz    quot what do you like about this truck   and what do you not like quot this list will be long lt g gt fil    quot we like everything about this truck   except the mechanical failures we have experienced   we like the looks   the comfort   and every other aspect   the mechanical failures we have experienced have considerably overwhelmed the details we like about this truck quot dndnkidz quot what have been the problems with the f crew cab dual wheel lariat   quot fil quot where do you want to start hehe within the first   miles we drove this truck   the transmission and the after cooler on the turbo failed   within the first    miles the steering box and the brakes failed   losing complete control of the truck   the torque converter in the transmission broke within    miles   the transmission failed and the torque converter failed again   a second time after      fixed   them   several times we have lost all the gauges   which are electronic   to include fuel gauge   speedometer   tachometer   overdrive on transmission fails   etc   if you lose the power steering fluid   like when the steering box broke   you can no longer steer    nor   stop the truck   because the fluid is all in one column   we continue to experience these same problems over and over quot dndnkidz quot what does the dealership do about these problems quot fil quot the dealership in utah where the truck was purchased   continues to fix the problems within a timely manner   but the problems continue to occur   but   for     you would expect to be purchasing a vehicle that did not   need   to be in the shop every other week or so it seems quot dndnkidz quot why don t you turn it back in as a   lemon quot fil quot the   law   in utah states that a vehicle can not be considered a lemon until the same problem has occurred at least four times within   months   or unless it has numerous safety failures   the next time one of these problems occur with our truck   we will be able to turn it in as a lemon   if we have one more major problem with this truck   we re turning it in and buying a chevy quot dndnkidz quot aside from all the mechanical failures   how comfortable is this truck to ride in quot fil quot well   it would be a lot more comfortable if we weren t constantly worrying about something breaking   the front and back seats are all extremely comfortable   there is plenty of leg room for short or tall passengers   and plenty of head room quot dndnkidz quot aside from the constant worry of something breaking   how is driving this truck   could someone such as myself   who has never driven a big truck only my bus van lt g gt   drive this truck quot my fil is   not   much taller than myself   so if he can drive it   i m sure i could hehe fil quot oh   it s easy to drive   when everything is functioning properly   it s an excellent vehicle to drive   it takes a barnyard to turn it around in   because it s a huge truck   but you have to expect needing a lot of area to turn such a large vehicle in quot dndnkidz quot how does it tow quot my in laws own tow a trailer fil quot it tows it s maximum allowed towing rate with no problems or lug on the engine   with the size   towing capacity   and deisel engine it can tow about anything you would want to tow quot dndnkidz quot would you recommend the   f crew cab dual wheel lariat   to anyone   if so   who quot fil quot i would recommend this particular truck to my brother in law hehe but nobody i actually like   i would recommend another truck similar to this one   but not this particular one   we would even purchase another   f crew cab dual wheel lariat   and try our luck with it   but we think   this one   that we got is a lemon   and someone on the manufacturing line had to have been on drugs   we know several people who own   f crew cab dual wheel lariat    who have not had any problems with thier truck   we just got   lucky quot personally   i do not know what any of the following   specs   mean   but based on the above   interview   with my father in law   it sounds like over all this would be a good truck   that he would highly recommend   but just not the one they got stuck with   the   recommend to potential buyers   is a yes   and   no response   he would

406,0,  i m a commercial industrial hvac service tech   the i work for has quite a few e   vans ranging from   to    i ve driven all including the    s   however my personal vehicle is a     all vans are nearly identical first i ll start out with the good points the engine in my    e   is a   v   not the triton   this engine provides plenty of power in all situations   acceleration is excellent and i have no problem burying the   mph speedometer   i would estimate top speed is around   mph in nearly   years    miles this van has never failed to start on the first turn of the key whether it s   degrees below   or   degrees in the shade   so far no repairs other than regular maintenance have been done to the engine gas mileage is excellent for this big loaded down van and with the large fuel tank i can go several days between fill ups the silver exterior paint clear coat finish is excellent   the van stays outside year round and goes into many hostile environments such as steal mills and construction sites yet after a quick wash looks new cargo capacity is good   i have the dealer installed shelves and cabinets and there s still plenty of floor space for big equipment   i also believe the height of the cargo area is better than most other makes very little wind noise the power steering is easy and quiet   the high back reclining bucket seats are very comfortable and durable   the heater is great even on the coldest days and the air conditioner does a really good job on the hottest days   the   speaker stereo sounds sweet   all accessory controls are clearly marked and easy to get at the dash layout is great   speedometer   trip meter   fuel gauge are all easy to see   there s also temperature   oil pressure and volt gauges now for the bad we ll start off with the minor stuff the styling yeesh   if you sent this van back to   it would fit right in and wouldn t turn a single head dash controls are cheap   to get the windshield washer to activate i have to hit the stalk hard several times   the plastic end of the gear select column   where the overdrive button is   was always flimsy and the stalk eventually broke off revealing wires and a small circuit board   also happened to one of our newer vans   epoxy took care of that problem   the cup holder wore out quickly and the single thin plastic tab that actually supports your drink broke off for me today sending my bottle of sobe into the storage compartment under it   the doors fit nicely   however the weather stripping on the bottom rubs the center of the rocker panel enough so that a    section of paint wore off   applying new paint doesn t help much as it eventually wears off in a few months   now i just keep it clean and waxed otherwise rust begins to appear   this has happened on both the drivers and passenger sides dome lights don t turn on when side and rear doors are open the   speed electronic overdrive transmission has not been the greatest   the engine provides enough power so that the transmission never has to   hunt   between rd gear and th   overdrive   something that plagued my previous    e   i have however had problems with it sticking in st gear on hot days   had several trips to the dealer and they never did find the problem   also the parking pawl inside the transmission broke while parked on a steep driveway as i was pulling equipment out from the back doors of the van   luckily i had the parking brake on which slowed it down enough for me to get out of the way and then chase it down and hop inside before it made it to the street   van had k miles at the time   dealer repaired the transmission and parking brake under warranty yes the parking brakes should have held the van now for the big disappointment the suspension on this van is completely useless   with the cargo area empty it drives fine   load it up and watch out as i said before i have the dealer installed shelves and cabinets   there is more storage space on the drivers side than the passenger side due to the two side doors so of course there will be more weight on the drivers side   this van can not handle an average load let alone an unequal load   loaded down with test equipment   tools and parts the van handles like a pig   the increased weight in the rear causes the front end to lift up which throws the geometry way off   having that little extra weight on the drivers side causes the van to pull hard to the right   if you follow behind the van you can literally see it dog tracking down the road   needless say front tire life is pathetic   at best k to k miles before the insides are worn to the threads and cupped   rears wear even but suffer from cupping too   lower ball joints completely gave away at k miles   had some kind of good will warranty on these but wouldn t honor it past k miles to try and solve these problems every van at the was equipped with air lift bags   each bag has an individual air line so that the back can be leveled off perfectly   then the van is sent to a frame and suspension shop where the front end is aligned with special cams while the cargo area has its usual load this expensive solution eliminated the hard pulling and dog tracking while greatly improving tire life   it still handles like a pig and the ride is a little rougher though in case there s any doubt i d like to mention these vans are not even close to be overloaded   i personally think designed these vans more like trucks trying to give them a car like ride when empty   unlike a truck a service van is a garage office on wheels and always loaded down  
407,0,  i own a econoline e   model conversion van   i like the quality of the van as well as all the convenient features such as cruise   cassette   air   abs   etc   however   i was surprise to discover after i purchased the van that one safety feature is missing   that is the door ajar warning is not included as standard   so   there is absolute no warning if one of the doors is not shut tight   i can not believe the van with all the standard features does not have this important and basic feature   so to the prospective buyers of this van   make sure you check that feature and ask for it when you buy it br br  
408,0,  when we purchased this vehicle   what sold me was the way that it handled   i was afraid it was going to be like driving a bus but it handles like a car   we wanted a car that seated more than just   because we have children and the older ones are getting big the first complaint i had was the back bench   there s just no headroom   and when i say    quot no headroom quot   i mean that my   year old fits the seat just perfectly   her head is just about touching the top we are very good with preventative maintenance but after a year of regular driving   we started to experience problems with the vehicle    when we were idle   the car would rumble and sound like it was going to cut off    the vehicle actually cut off a few times for no apparent reason    my abs light would go on and off we took the truck to the dealership several times before the warranty ran out throughout the first three years but they never found anything wrong   now that the warranty has run out   three years after purchasing a brand new vehicle   the truck runs like an old   used   chevy truck   it s not bad   but i expect better quality   reliability and service br br  
409,0,  in december of    i was   years old   i was a newly licensed driver   and was looking for a car that was economical   reliable   and most importantly   safe   the   escort seemed to fit the bill perfectly the car i picked off the lot was a four door model   the color was bright   neon green    the correct name of that specific color was   quot calypso green quot   such a color really appealed to my teenage self at the time   it did not include many options   but it did include air conditioning   cassette player   and power mirrors   when i pulled of the car lot with it   i was a happy camper one day   about six months later   the trouble began   i had been driving the car all day   and it had been running fine   i stopped at a store for a few minutes   when i came back out again   it simply would not start   when you turned the key   nothing happened   no sound   not even a click   my brand new car was towed back to the dealership and was discovered to have a dead cell in the battery   the battery was replaced   and all was well again at about    miles   from under the hood came a loud   annoying chirping noise   as it turned out   the fan belt was frayed and needed to be replaced   it was found to be odd that the belt had gone bad at such low mileage   upon further investigation   the pulley that operates the fan belt was found to be defective   both the pulley and the belt were replaced a few months later   at about    miles   the car would not start again   once again   it took a ride on the tow truck to the dealer and was found to have a defective ignition module   luckily   the warranty was still in effect   because that would have been the most costly repair of all   about     the car is in pretty good running condition now   and i hope all of the kinks have been worked out   currently   the speedometer cable makes an extremely annoying chirping noise at low to moderate speeds and the temperature gauge does not work if i could go back in time   knowing what i know now   i would not have bought this car   i can only hope that others have had a better experience than i have br br  
410,0,  bought this car new in    at night   in a snowstorm   i thought i was getting a champagne colored vehicle   but when i picked it up   it was a horrible pinkish bronze color   has to be the ugliest color ever used what do i love   it was cheap   it s got    on it and still runs pretty well   i ve recently had to replace broken springs   struts   brakes   rotors   and the exhaust system   but until now   other than an electrical problem   below   it has only needed oil   gas and tires   the guy who recently worked on it said   quot you must really love this car quot   to be honest   if i could afford it right now   i d give it to the kids and get something nicer and which had a quieter ride early on   i had a lot of trouble with the cooling fan rotor burning out   then the radio would come on when the car was shut off   the fan rotor burned out three times before the dimwit mechanics at my dealership finally figured out that it was a faulty ignition   which never really shut off   once the ignition was replaced   the electrical problems ceased   so if you think your car is possessed   have the ignition checked i wouldn t buy another one just because i m ready to move on   our first escort     was a fiasco   we only bought another one because it was cheap and the dealership is close by br br  
411,0,  a few years ago while i was doing an internship in los angeles   moving from place to place   generous volunteers who d put us up for a few weeks each   i rented a white escort to load all my stuff and drive to a few places   it was the cheapest car they had for rent   and i didn t have much choice   as only one rental place accepted drivers under   years old to rent their cars   the surcharge and insurance are ridiculous first   the car looks okay   it reminded me a lot of my dad s old   taurus   especially the sloped front and the sloped headlights   in fact   it s like a   quot mini me quot   version of the taurus   visibility is great all around   and i sat high enough on this car to be able to see everything around me   the stereo   cassette player   was pretty terrible   i had the windows rolled down on the freeway and listening to the radio at almost full blast and the distortion was awful to listen to   i could have rolled up the windows   it s l a   smog central   after all   but i like driving with the windows down   the car felt solid though   and i didn t feel unsafe in it at all   except   read below the interior is intuitive   the gauges and controls are where they belong   nothing annoyed me   which is a good thing   the seats were a bit too firm   but then i didn t buy this car and had to live with it i had the   door model   and i loaded a lot of stuff in that car   i was impressed by the space in this   quot subcompact quot   car   the drive was what i expected   not spectacular   but enough power to not get blown away on the freeways   this is definitely a great   quot point a to point b quot   kind of car with great fuel economy   i think i got a few days of driving off a quarter tank of gas   and i drove a lot too now   the most annoying thing about this car is the automatic seat belts   i never understood this stupid invention   it works like this   the across your chest part of the seat belt is actually   quot buckled quot   by default   and when your get in the car   it stretches between you and the steering wheel   when you close your door   the part that is attached to the door frame   quot slides quot   back to the pillar next to your seat   and then you re supposed to buckle up the lap part of the seat belt yourself   now did you catch the stupidity of that concept   let me explain   if you re making   quot automatic quot   seat belts   the stuff should automatically buckle itself up with no help from you   instead   it s   quot half automatic quot   you have to buckle the lap belt yourself   otherwise you re not doing yourself any good   it s like not wearing belts because you say your car has airbags   another point   if you happen to get in the car   close the door and realize that it wasn t shut tight   and then you open the door and close it again   the seat belts slide back and forth and back upon every door movement you just made but the real gripe i have about this concept is that i am an injured victim of such brilliant invention who lives now to tell you about it   albeit with some permanent war scars to show for it   you see   the first thing i do when i get into a car   without any nanosecond of thought   is to put on my seat belts   always   even if i m just backing out of my garage   feet to wash my car   yes   i m that anal   so naturally   i get into this car   close the door and immediately reach for the seat belts   whoah   the belt isn t back there   oh no   here comes the belt   sliding into position like a roller coaster out of control   bam   my fingers are caught on the rails as the belts slide into the pillar   ooooooooooouch   it takes a good second or two to realize what just happened   and then a loud scream and other profanities lurching outward from my mouth   and then i realize that i ve been attacked by the seat belts   i quickly open the door   and the thing backs off   taking a good chunk of ectoderm   skin   with it   i m bleeding   a lot   blood everywhere   not as bad as the brains in the movie pulp fiction   but pretty bad   now how do i explain this bloody shirt to my boss    quot uh   my car attacked me quot and you know what s sad   i did it again a few days later   even after spending a good meditative chanting session   telling myself that i will wait two seconds for the belt to do its thing before moving any part of my body   yes   twice   same bloody mess   this thing is dangerous so as you can figure   if a car has automatic seat belts   i get no where near that car    quot thanks for offering me a ride   but i ll take the bus instead   on second thought   can i ride in your trunk   it ll be much safer for me back there quot   this stuff should be outlawed   anyone know who invented this thing   the inventor needs to have his her patent revoked and be subject to having his her fingers caught in the rails of the belts at least two times   sheesh br br

413,0,  i am writing this because of a difficult experience i am having with the pickup truck i recently purchased from peyton cramer   in torrance   california   after this involvement with   i will never buy from or recommend for the duration of my car buying days the reason for my dissatisfaction with is a result of a mechanical problem with my truck that has not been repaired   in short   the truck has an extremely rough   sporadic shake in idle   i returned to the dealership with the the day after i purchased it and i spoke with the service manager   he acknowledged the problem   and advised me the shake could be caused by water in the fuel line or carbon in the engine   and to bring the truck back after five hundred miles if the shake did not go away   after five hundred miles   i brought the truck back to peyton cramer where it was serviced   another service manager   advised me the cam timing   pertaining to the california emissions system   was the cause of the shake   and it was a normal condition of the vehicle   i was not satisfied with the diagnosis so i took the car in for servicing with two other dealerships and received two different diagnoses for the shake   i left both dealerships without a repair and contacted the general manager of peyton cramer   about my situation   after speaking with howard herman   i brought the truck in for servicing at peyton cramer   and left a second time with this issue being unresolved   i contacted the customer service hotline    they are helpless   and i was told to contact my dealership again   and the regional office   so i did i get a call from the regional office in los angeles and they said they are reviewing their records and that they have determined that peyton cramer could not replicate the problem with my and that it is a normal working condition of the truck   this is after i brought it to the dealership four times   every time the dealership   peyton cramer   acknowledges the shake   accepts the vehicle in for servicing   and then after not being able to find the problem   denying that there is a problem in the first place i have yet to determine the real problem   however   i brought my truck to two independent mechanics   these mechanics were able to evaluate and judge that there was a problem with my truck by taking a visual survey of the truck shaking   both have stated and recommended that there is problem with the truck and to take it back to the dealership where it was originally purchased   i am completely dissatisfied with my   not only because of its mechanical problem   but also because of the great inconvenience and frustration i have suffered due to s lack of responsibility   the truck s condition is below the reasonable expectations of a new owner always test drive for at least    minutes on various road conditions   even with a new car   if you do end up getting a lemon   will tell you to eat it b to see more problems with   search the internet with the words   secret warranties b this review tends to focus on the negative aspects of the   if i didn t have the mechanical problem with this truck   i might be happier with it s overall performance   before i bought this   i had an f    when i moved to los angeles i decided the f   was too big to be driving around a city   so i went for the   the maneuverability and size convenience is there   and i lowered my car payment   easy to park and move around on the smaller streets   the ride is a bit more smooth than the f    however if you do hit a bump the tends to bounce around a bit   i have noticed that with all the fords i have driven    i have owned three in my life   taurus   f      i am a larger person   so i have been a bit squished in the   if you go with this truck make sure it has power windows   because it s hard to drive and roll up the window at the same time   also make sure you get the supercab with the four doors   it makes all the difference in getting in and out of the back seat   however if you have kids or carry people around in your backseat frequently   i don t recommend this truck because of the way the seats face sideways with your back to the outside   if somebody was sitting in the back   and there was ever a side collision   the people in the backseat could loose their spines   i don t carry many people often   so i just use the backseat for carrying extras and locking things up in the car i have also found that the gas mileage is lower than what is reported on the sticker   it truly gets about    mpg rd hwy   if you go to the message boards on edmunds   you can see this is a repetitive problem with the the engine power i feel if fair   i have a   l   i can make it up a hill without downshifting most of the time   however it does not accelerate well uphill   my f   had the smaller engine   and could not make it up a hill in fifth   i always had to downshift so that i would not loose speed beside the constant earthquake in my car   and the fact that the customer service reps and my dealer have shafted me   the looks very pretty   i have silver   good luck in buying this truck  
414,0,   the beginning   i thought the poor   taurus could use a good review   though   unfortunately   i don t imagine many people will be calling this car   good   in the end   through my experience   no   this car isn t mine   it s my father s   he got it to replace the   aires he got to replace the tempo   even before the poor tempo burst into flames    see my review on that for an even worse horror story my dad had serviced the car throughout its existence   even though he hadn t previously owned it   dad s the head mechanic at a sunoco ultra service station   knows many people around the area   and has access to many good deals when people wish to sell their cars   though he knew what problems taurus   can have   he knew the history of the car   and had taken good care of it   as had the previous owner   despite having    miles on it   it was all highway miles   as it had been driven about   miles each day to work and back   and furthermore   it was chosen before for comfort   something the aires lacked   so   he sold the aires   and got the taurus   hoping for a better ride   more power   more comfort   more cargo space   and more features   that much he got   but   he got a lot more with it than he bargained for    equipment and features   the   taurus wagon we got should be considered a near luxury car   in my opinion   so much more than anything else i ve owned   really   to that point   of course   i didn t really own it   dad did   but i drove it an awful lot   the six cylinder    liter engine is in actuality a eight cylinder engine with the last two cylinders chopped off   the design for the eight cylinder was about forty years old at the time of its manufacture   if not a bit older   six cylinder engines are supposed to be inherently stable   but because of the nature of this engine   its not   to make the engine stable   they added a balance shaft to it   and mounted the engine on liquid filled rubber   unfortunately   these mounts were horribly easy to break   it turned out   there were attempts to use the taurus as a police car that failed because the engine would so easily rip off the mounts   and the car in general was not durable under such stress   fords of this era had good computers   but they couldn t be really be accessed with any ease   even my   lebaron s computer could easily be accessed with a simple hook up   gm and chrysler share a common link   to which a small computer can be attached   and all sorts of data be derived   to fix an electrical problem on a   or get any information from the computer   the process is much more complex   involving electro voltage meter things   and up until recently   all fords were like this   a big pain even so   there was lots of information available in the car anyhow   thanks to the digital dash feature   and the accompanying computer that came with it   from miles per gallon at any given moment   how long until you ll need to refuel again   to mph averages   the computer is a nifty thing   plus   i adore digital dashes   even if this one s green screen is hard to read during the daylight    my lebaron s is easy to read in daylight the engine is stable in the end   though   and gets decent milage for the size of the car and engine itself    mpg city and   highway is what s on the sticker   and i average around   miles per gallon with the thing   however   our engine has been replaced with the   model   thanks to the older one needing to be rebuilt   well   see the next section for that   it should be about the same   though      fueleconomy gov feg noframes   shtml    the transmission is rather good   thankfully   the four speed has overdrive features as well   and i ve never experienced a problem here   it seems sound enough all on its own   it easily powers the car to a quick speed with little trouble   and there s never a real lack of power from that    v   though   i m afraid to use it   for fear of damaging the poor thing the rack and pinion power steering feels more floaty than my other cars   with less feedback   its not necessarily a bad thing   and does give a fair amount of feedback in the end   its just easier to turn   though   after k miles   it is a bit weaker than i d like   there have been a lot of problems with it   though see the next section for that the interior is spacious   with   cubic inches   or    cubic feet for passengers   the luggage volume is   cubic inches   or    cubic feet   which can be made much larger if you fold the back seat forward   the taurus wagon can reasonably carry very large things in its spacious rear   and has been used successfully as such for some time by us   there s a series of useful hooks in the back   too   to make sure things stay in one place the driver s steering wheel contains an airbag   and there s another for the front passenger as well as an option   the car got four stars for driver   and five stars for passenger crash test ratings      nhtsa dot gov ncap slist cfm vehyear   vehmake vehmodel taurus    the version of the   taurus wagon we got was filled with all the best features   exterior wise   there was the roof rack   the   inch alloy wheels   no hubcaps   just the pattern there   and a nice classic light blue paint with dark grey highlights   the antenna is mechanical   and adjustable from the inside   additionally   the front doors have keypads for keyless entry codes to unlock either one door   or all doors   depending on the code inside   the first noticeable thing is the leather seats   even with all the use they ve gotten   they re all in wonderful condition for being ten years old   and they are comfortable   with electric adjustment for both front bucket seats   and even air bladder along the lower back the dash is vinyl all along   and if taken care of   won t split   unfortunately   ours did   when we forgot to keep it all shiny and nice   oh well   its not really noticeable   but its annoying   the floor matts are original   and hold well on the clean fuzzy floor   too the shifter is located between the center consol   and drink holders   unfortunately   the light died in there   and one can t see if one is in park or drive at night   but otherwise it works well   and i can easily go by feel   its stiffer than most   and the handle is a firm rubber which is easy to grip the center console has a compartment in the top which one can store money and other things in   if you lift the top   under is a place for tapes and cds   or whatever else you like   the cup holders opposite it on the front click in and out   and are sturdy enough   we replaced the regular stereo   and put a cd player there instead   the stereo   though   worked well enough   however   all the buttons are flimsy plastic all the way up the front   not only on the stereo   but the climate control as well   they break easily   and a few no longer glow green   instead showing the white light below the air conditioning is wonderfully cold   never had a problem with it   there s a small lcd above the controls for it   which give you the ability to control the temperature to an exact degree in the car   it will also tell you the temperature outside with the click of a button   and just above that   exactly the same as in my tempo   is an inverse lcd screen   displaying the time brightly   clearly   and in inverse green and black all the time   along the driver s door is controls for powered windows   locks   and mirrors   on the ceiling is controls for reading lamps   and more interestingly   a sunroof   which retracts perfectly and adjustably with the button   a screen can be drawn over the sunroof to block the light   additionally   if its bothersome   the windshield wipers come on strong   and do a very good job of keeping everything clear during a storm   though there have been electrical problems with them   see the next section   there s a wiper for the back window as well   which can independently be turned on and off   quite useful the sound system was mediocre   even if it was   premium sound   as was claimed   it was easy to replace and upgrade   and there was even for a spot for a subwoofer under the floor in the back wagon portion of the vehicle   it s the perfect distance for wonderful bass which doesn t overpower   the high beams can be turned on by pulling back the windshield wiper stick   which unfortunately also can be a pest if the wipers go on by accident   the lights themselves turn on and off automatically   depending on the light level   there s a knob to turn them on and off manually as well   if you wish   furthermore   that same stick controls the blinkers   which are loathe to turn off automatically in a turn unless its very sharp    problems   oh boy   we thought when we got this car that everything was basically new and fixed and in working order   when i borrowed it   utoh   i was used to driving my underpowered chrysler lebaron   and thusly   had a very heavy foot   i ripped the engine off its mounts in driving to college   and made it stall several times   it wasn t really my fault   i was told   though   we discovered that the engine needed to be rebuilt   not really worth it to do so   though instead   dad got a whole new engine from a friend   a   taurus engine   essentially the same as the old one   straight from a car owned by older people that had been totaled from the back   only k miles   too   so   he put it in   on new mounts   and it ran well after a bit of adjusting however   another problem occurred promptly after   the hose for the power steering broke partially   so   dad fixed it   it broke again   he fixed it again   it broke again   he fixed it with an expensive kit again   it broke again   he fixed it temporarily   it broke again as expected   but by that time   the super duty kit came   that worked   the engine is unbalanced enough for the hose to shake and break off each time   this is a problem he knew about beforehand   though   next problem is one that still is present   another known problem with the taurus is the windshield wiper electronics are flaky   and that s true with this one   they don t always stop at the bottom when turned off   and often stop all together when running   very dangerous   one needs to turn them on and off after that   to get them to go again   the car creeks ominously in turns   though its nothing to worry about   i m told   wind noise is otherwise minimal   though   even at high speeds   though   thanks to the engine being on those weak mounts   fast acceleration is dangerous to the health of the car   and should be avoided   those are major problems   and i know it has suffered more in the past than just that   overall   its miserably unreliable   even if it is a comfy feature filled ride   i m afraid i ll break it each time i drive it b conclusion   as nice of a car as it is   its problems would prevent us from ever considering it again   it really wasn t worth it overall to fix it so many times   and just barely worth it to fix it each individual time as well   as nice as it looks and handles   the   taurus wagon is a time bomb   and we know we ll have to replace it sometime soon   even if we ll miss all its neat little features  
415,0,  the first serious driving lesson i ever had was in this car   so i have a certain soft spot for it   my father frighteningly guided me through the suburban roads of concord   massachusetts as i learned the nuances of control and timing that comprise the art of driving   i will always love the   taurus for heralding me to the wonderful   amazing world of driving   but   i must concede that it is a far from perfect piece of machinery my father owns the taurus gl   mid range model   with the optional    liter v engine   with a reasonable price   this car is the perfect family hauler   or at least it would be if were not for a few problems this car is very spacious   while the seats are not exceptionally comfortable   there is plenty of leg room front and back for just about any potential passenger   because of this fact   long road trips are not a large hassle with the taurus   the cargo space is simply massive   larger than most other wagons and some suvs the handling of the taurus wagon is not spectacular   the steering feel is somewhat heavy   almost truck like   the brakes are also very heavy   although they work exceptionally well with the optional anti lock system   on turns   the car goes where you want it   but torque steer is very heavy and the wheel does not smoothly spin back to its center but instead jerks and stops repeatedly on the way there   still   the handling is appropriate to this type of car   and compared to other american made station wagons   it is actually pretty good the internal controls of the car are placed very well   the window and lock controls are placed as well and are as easy to operate as those in japanese cars   the speedometer and tachometer are very clear   the speedometer does not go very high so the exact speed is very easy to determine from a quick glance   the only control that i do not like is the gear shifter attached to the steering column   unless you have the exact sequence memorized   which is not too hard   shifting gears is difficult   despite my preferential gripe   this feature frees more floor space and makes possible seating for a small person between the driver and the front passenger the wagon looks nice enough   not terribly sleek   but not heinously ugly like the   and later taurus models   i personally think that this particular generation         is the best looking of all taurus models the taurus is pretty safe   my father was hit on the side at highway speed and he walked away without a scratch   the only result being a large dent on one door   the frame was not warped at all and the door was all that had to be fixed the    liter v gives only   hp   but they are available at a low rpm     and they are accompanied by a whopping   pounds foot of torque   these numbers mean that the engine has more than enough muscle to tackle any hill or haul any load just so long as blazing speed or off the line performance are not needed   actually   the acceleration is pretty good for a larger mid sized wagon   this does come at the expense of gas mileage   in city driving   the mileage is well under   miles per gallon unfortunately   this    liter v power plant is apparently one of the least reliable engines ever made by   together with s standard average to below average reliability   we have a volatile combination   my father spends quite a bit of money on repairs   most recently and notably   he had to have the transmission rebuilt and he had to have extensive work done on the brakes   these repairs were done at both great expense and great inconvenience the taurus is a good family hauler with decent power and good space   however the reliability problems make it hard for me to recommend it even though i very much want to

417,0,   introduction   man   i can t believe i m doing this   i m breaking my own rule   i m updating and reposting the article   why am i doing this   because my opinion of this truck has completely changed   it has transferred its weight from my love it list   to my hate it list   all in one day this truck is the supercab     liter   automatic   x   xl with add ons   flare side pickup b pros   not many the airconditioner is cold   very cold   i love the airconditioner the cupholders are great   easily holding anything up to huge drinks confidently the radio sounds great and i love the controls   easy to reach from the driver seat the paint is still beautiful   even after    miles not on the same engine it is very roomy   you could easily seat six in the interior you are sitting very high in the truck   command of the road is there   you feel powerful but you aren t we haven t put any transmissions in it   lack of power from the engine is why   i m guessing the doors are cool when you need to unlock them   pull up on the handle and they are unlocked   the single key is also nice b neutral   a third door is great   albeit on the passenger side   when it would be really helpful on the drivers side one gas tank is enough right   i expect two in trucks   especially with this gas mileage b cons   bear with me   this is going to take a while the engine that i thought was the original wasn t   original replaced at    miles   died at    miles   it was gutless then   i forgave it   assuming that it was tired from    miles of service   the new engine is worthless     liters of gas guzzling worthless junk   zero to sixty was measured not professionally   to be   or   seconds   towing has to be less than    lbs gas mileage is always nice   this truck doesn t get it   it gets gas footage   it gets    feet per gallon   or more commonly referred to as    mpg   in a tiny v   this was with ac on not max   on the highway   with overdrive on   this was my low   average is about    with a maximum of   once    mph for two hours because of hazardous road conditions the bench seat in the front is stupid   i hate it   it moves with the driver   so if the driver is short   the passenger better hope   s he is too   the rear seat is no better   very cramped the seat in this truck is ridiculous   lack of lumbar always leaves me with a back ache   there is no padding which leaves my backside sore   and the headrest pushed your head forward the cruise control freaked out on me   i pushed resume   assuming it would reach   mph assigned   it looked down to the surprise of   mph and climbing   sometimes it won t work at all the radio has the curious gremlin of not shutting off sometimes   it will continue to be on   although the button is in styling has to be the worst   it looks like its trying to be aerodynamic   but at the same time appears as if it is going to fall on its nose this truck will not hold an allignment   after the first one wore off   we replaced ball joints   steering items among other things   it has been alligned three times in the last year and was out of allignment yesterday b overall   this truck downright sucks   the engine sucks   the gas mileage sucks   the little things drive me crazy i do not recommend this truck   look elsewhere br br  
418,0,  my apologies first off for the rambling course this post is about to take   these are the things i ve encountered in the last mos as they occur to me   if you are under     quot   this truck is way too big for you   i am    quot   and when i shift gears   my legs rub against the dash   indicating that the truck would likely break my legs in the event of a front end collison   the air bags are nigh on fatal for a person of my size   and the seat has to be so far forward when i drive it   that i look like a hood ornament   if you are independantly wealthy and gas prices don t affect you   go ahead   this baby s for you   it ll quickly help you lose weight   by first lightening your wallet   spare change jar   and mattress where you store that hidden stash of cash   kraft dinner for a month after repairs   i researched the cost of a clutch in the event that i needed it     cdn for parts alone   i nearly crashed the truck upon reciept of that information i bought the truck because i wanted to have something to haul materials for house renovations   and for a horse trailer in the near future   i learned afterwards that the modifications required to handle a horse trailer greatly exceeded the ins and payment savings of having purchased a cyl   the truck has great   quot get up and go quot   but a word of advice   if your performance or milage decrease   don t let them reprogram it   it hasn t run run right since   it s been so expensive to me   both the gas milage and the cost of   quot diagnostics quot   to find out what s wrong with it   that i can t afford to gas it up anymore   nor can i afford to take it in to find out what s wrong with it following is a copy of the email that i sent to of canada   to date   this issue has not been resolved   and i am about to trade the truck off on something more economical   and less prone to breakage i m sure there s more   but it s late and i can t remember anything else right now   storm why in the world would something as dangerous as the brakeline freezing due to the exhaust pipe being in front of the wheels not be a   quot recall quot   i bought a   f   about   months ago   upon the advice of a friend who had had wonderful things to say about the one that he has   i recently noticed that it was increasingly difficult to get out of my driveway some days   the truck smelled terrible   like something burnt   and my gas mileage was awful   i have been releasing the brake   the light was off   the pedal was up   but the brake apparently was still on   i called the dealership   because i had been told to watch for this problem   and had wanted it fixed   they said that because the truck was no longer on its   quot original warranty quot   that the repair would not be done by   and that to have it done is about      this seems a little steep doesn t it   especially since   a catback system for my other vehicle was only    installed   and that was tuned exhaust   and also that they thought that i should bring the truck in so that they can make sure that there s no damage to the wheels or brakes   so now   because of a design flaw on s part   i have endangered my brakes and wheels as well   why should i potentially be liable for a repair like this   this seems a little bit ridiculous to me   and frankly   with the way that this truck has   nickeled and dimed   me for the last   months   power steering pump   oil pan gasket   maf sensor   computer reprogrammed x   a check engine light when i   silly me   decided to wash the engine   back firing   mi ga combined driving   block heater cord   this was the last straw     i don t even have the money to do this sort of work anymore   it has steadily whittled my bank balance to practically nothing    i have had it in for warranty work   times in the space of the first months i had it paid a deductible   times   as some of the work relied on parts and i was asked to bring it back a second time   was charged for things that were on warranty   when i called customer care   i was told that it was an issue between myself and the dealership   and that would not intervene   that sounds a lot like the dealerships have been given autonomy   that s quite frightening   and there are numerous things that are not covered by the   quot don t worry   it s all covered on warranty quot   warranty   so sayeth the salesman that i purchased the truck from   as well as the sales manager   service manager and several other people of the dealership   coverage that i purchased   i had purchased this truck so that i could park a car that i   thought   was costing me a great deal of money   i had thought that i would have a vehicle that i would have to do only routine maintenance on   and that would be reliable   and not a source of financial drain   soon i will have a clutch to do   possibly brakes   they say that my exhaust is shot   i think it s safe to say that i couldn t have done all this damage in the amount of time that i ve had the vehicle   i have had to do rear brakes once in my other vehicle   and a clutch once   as i learned to drive a manual on this vehicle   and had a leaky rear main seal   this is in the space of nearly   years   and exhaust doesn t corrode that fast   i don t care how many kms you put on it   based on the last   months   i might have to park the truck   and i am puttng my poor little   firebird back on the road   it gets mi gal even though it s shooting gas out of the top of the carborator   if the brakes can freeze on   what stops them from freezing when they are not on   i m told there s a great deal of hydraulic pressure that stops this from being an issue   but the system is only as good as it s weakest part   and when using the   brute force   method to break them free   i would think that something somewhere has got to give   not to mention what it will likely do to the tires   such as icing them up   this would cause poor braking conditions   wouldn t it   i would rather not find this out by hitting another vehicle or worse yet   a person   i understand that there were safety concerns that were the reason that was making the modifications   do these safety concerns go away once the truck is not on warranty   i should think not   i would think that this would be a recall situation   and not just a bulletin   this situation concerns me a great deal   and if i do not find satisfactory resolution for it   i may have to lodge a complaint with consumer reports br br  
419,0,  we took our   super cab truck in to be serviced as soon as we received the fuel line recall notice   the servicing dealer inspected the fuel line and stated that the fuel line had passed inspection and did not need replacing   evidently it is s policy not to replace a defective part unless it is malfunctioning   we drove down to florida about two months later and noticed poor gas mileage   when the truck was parked   we also noticed a strong gas odor   upon examining the street under the truck   we saw gas dripping from our truck   we immediately called for an appointment to arrange for the problem to be repaired   which turned out to be the recalled fuel line unbeknown to us   the repair was made   but we were not informed that the problem was due to the safety recall   we were advised to take the problem to directly   we wrote and subsequently received a phone call from their customer relations center advising us that the part repaired was the safety recalled fuel line and to get in touch with the original dealer who made the inspection   that dealership is going to reimburse us for repairs   but we have other expenses we incurred due to the safety recall not being repaired when first inspected   we will have to go to directly   again   for these additional expenses   the bottom line is that should be more proactive in repairing all safety recalls whether or not they are malfunctioning at the time   as it stands now   it is our understanding from two dealerships that repairs only malfunctioning parts in safety recalls   we might have been exposed to a fire or something worse had we not noticed the problem ourselves   this seems to be an ongoing problem with and we feel they need an attitude adjustment if they are going to stay in business  
420,0,  i bought a new   f   and i had it only   months and traded it in it was a v   and it had no power what so ever we live on a mountain   and i would have to shift into rd gear to climb it   while little cy s were flying up it   i was embarrassed sorry   but when i put that much money into something   i want it to perform for me   and this truck didn t i think this truck is best suited for flat areas   it did do well at highway speeds   but like i said    no power pulling a hill to be honest i like a truck that is a little more flashy looking   and this didn t make me say   quot wow quot this was the only vehicle that we have owned that i could say i hated it i know some people are reading this and saying they love their truck and i am glad you like yours   i didn t like mine br br  
421,0,  i own a   f supercab v with automatic transmission   i now wish i had my old   speed nissan back   if you go to the ntsb website you will see that has more recalls than any other car maker   first   some credit   the truck looks and rides nicely   but that s where it stops   with the kind of money you put into a car these days   you expect value   i bought the truck for more roominess and a bigger payload   i bought it used in    with k on it   since then   i have been mailed   recalls   one for fuel line leaks   one for a timing cover gasket leak   and one for a steering shaft possible breakage and accident   the truck developed a rattling noise that sounded like a loose exhaust part   it turned out to be both catalytic coverters   this cost me    to replace   during that time the check engine light had come on   why   because the head gasket on the right side had blown   k miles   had to replace that   and all     oxygen sensors   the catalytics failed because they were filled with coolant from the blown head gasket   total      next   the alternator went out   k miles   then the oil pump went bad   nearlt ruined   then the a c clutch bearings gave out and made the most horrible noise while driving   replaced that   when this truck gives up   and it s close now at k because i think my head gasket is going again and catalytics are rattling again   i will strip what parts are still good and sell them off   then get a nissan or toyota   they may not be as pretty or have all the bells and whistles   but you can take one k or more and never have to replace anything major with proper care  
422,0,  i own a     speed   v    gl version of this car   happens to be green   the most popular color   i think   so be sure you know where you parked mine does not have all the bells and whistles   i was looking for a reasonable priced family car   and that s what i got   safety features   it has a full body crash frame   a nice safety feature i hope to never use   i did not get the abs brakes   i don t happen to like abs   it comes with dual front airbags   the passenger side can not be turned off   which i wish it could   it has some feature that will drop the engine out in a major crash   also not tested exterior   green   aluminum wheel covers   molded bumpers   nothing special interior   light gray   green illumination lights   okay   why do they make automatics with a tach as standard equipment but it s optional equipment for a stick   this has always bugged me   controls are laid out fairly well   they didn t load up a lot of features on the stalks   which is nice   one side is the wiper controls and the other is the lights   cruise controls are on the steering wheel at thumb height   can t stand the rest position for hands at   and   o clock   the new recommended   safe   position   horn is still in the center of the steering wheel   but you got ta push hard   air heat controls nicely laid out   well lit   air is good   heat takes a bit of time   i replaced the factory stereo but the speakers are ok unless you re an audiophile   all four in the doors   it has a cubbyhole under the stereo for expansion or storage    cd s fit ok   hard to get into in rd or th   next to the emergency brake is a retractable cup holder   only holds medium size to go drinks or   oz cans   sometimes tips   two map lights plus a rd light with door open delay timer in the center front   large glovebox   shallow door pockets for both front doors   adjustable height restraints are nice   rear has two shoulder restraints and one middle lap belt features   power windows   work well   rear go only to child height   child lockout   power mirrors good   remote entry   about worthless   you have to practically stand at the door to get them to work   even with brand new battery problems    this will take some time   get a drink   okay   first the latch that releases the fuel door has never worked   i often have to go out of the car to pry it open   can t wait until the day i can t refuel   the knob that adjusts the tilt of the front seat is hard to reach   hard to turn   the direction controls for airflow break really easily   flimsy brittle small pieces of plastic   the back seat is shallow and uncomfortable for anyone over    tall   the middle back seat restraint is not suitable for a carseat   trust me on this   the dead man foot rest is awful   this year model did not come with the split rear seats   a must for all cars of this type and a huge oversight on the part of   a rear seats that fold down   even the whole seat   is necessary   and this one could have sure used it   the engine temperature gauge constantly shows the engine as almost in the red   dealership told me this was   quot normal quot   and they showed me a white paper about it   the engine is loud   and if you don t have the radio on you ll go nuts   this is by far the most annoying thing about the car assets   the front seats are comfy for the short in stature   finally fixed the sticky reverse gear box problem   some will know and understand what i mean   no more forcing the car into reverse or repeatedly pressing the clutch until it goes   in fact   gear box is nice   as is clutch on this car   for a four cylinder   engine performs nicely   don t expect to race anyone   but you can get it up to   without the car shaking to death   don t try this with a   escort   gas mileage is good   engine is laid out and marked well enough to know what s where   trunk space is large   but beware the hinges which can crush tall items placed under it overall   would be a nice   cheap secondhand car   but leaves much to be desired at new   full price   has had   recalls so far br br  
423,0,  my wife and i recently acquired a used   contour   we were looking for something else but the car dealer convinced us this was   quot the car for us quot   this car has given us nothing but trouble   it has been recalled twice   the speakers are the current problem   the right speakers will periodically stop working   in addition to that the bass has never been really good but i do like to have a system that can at least vibrate the car a little   the bass levels at their highest setting will give most rap songs a little beat but not a boost or a bang   we have also had problems with the air conditioner and the brakes within less than a year from when we bought it   it also does not get good gas mileage   we have to refill at least once a week   we are looking for a way to affordably get rid of it   in all fairness   i may be a little bias because i use to own an   escort and it gave me a large amount of problems and cost me too much money   after the escort i have developed a negative opinion towards and compact car but this contour is proving my opinion right   i was hoping that i was wrong about how bad cars are but the contour that we bought has proven me more right than ever before   positive comments   well it does have excellent pick up or   quot get up and go quot   that may attribute to the bad gas mileage   this car is great for those guys who like to race little old ladies at the red light   it will most definitely beat most small cars   buses   and semi trucks   my opinion of this car and most cars is that they are prone to failure   don t sneeze near it or kick the tires or else it could fall apart   maybe s just don t like me     
424,0,  myself   being a young guy   went to a car dealer   car happy   and wanted a car   looked around   was limited to an automatic transmission   looking around   i was surprised to have seen a big white contour for such a cheap price   i test drove it   big   lots of buttons   great   huh they conned me in to buying it   so i bought it   thank god i got the extended warantee   the car was in the shop many times   one day in the morning   i was getting gas   i learned the gas was on the opposite side of the car   ok   i ll reverse it   pull to the other side   if i could only shift it out of park   the gear shifter was broken   had to tear it off   allright   i got out of there   later that day   strange   windows going up slowly   starter sounded like it wasn t ever gon na start again   was driving   all of a sudden   would nt go over    and it decided to stall   got it fixed   fine   besides the foggyness of the front lights which ruined any attractive qualities the car may have had   the problems with turning   axle   the belts to be replaced   the parking light coming on while i was driving   it was a good car   looked better at night   great power if you turn the air conditioner off   and there is noone but you in the car   ca nt get that with a honda   good first car if you have a warantee and a loner car   the only problem i can t get fixed that i hate would have to be whipping around corners   it feels like the wheels will fall off when you go   around a corner   the tires screeching no matter what the air pressure   it is not a honda   don t confuse it as one   it is big   bulky   and sorta slow   don t try to break a speed record     
425,0,  this vehicle was a first time lease for my husband and i   it was the only car we qualified for so our choices were limited   we really enjoyed owning a new car   it ran great and we were very pleased with the outside body and all the functions of the we found the interior very disappointing   from the first week we had the car there were problems with the interior   the carpet pulled away from the frame and it took   months for them to get the parts to fix it   we also had problems with the plastic molding that enclosed the seat belts this molding broke   times in   years and has to be replaced each time which put the car in the shop for at least one day   at about   months the driver side window crank broke off and the dealer said it was not under warranty   then a week later the passenger side broke also   neither of the cranks had much use at any time   this car drives smoothly   but if you are looking for good wear and tear this car is not the one   i can not see children doing well in this car br br  
426,0,  when you think of mustangs   the first thing that comes to mind is a muscle car mustangs have long been classified with such cars as camaros   firebirds   chevlles   and others   but the question for this model is that with the new sporty look of the exterior   which looks gay to me     does the engine and the rest of the car hold up to my expectations   as a young car enthusiast   i went to a local dealership and saw a nice gt with a v in it very nice    when i say that the monte carlo is better here s why   i drive a   monte carlo with a   year warranty on everything and i got the car for only    dollars   more than half what i would have to pay for a new my car is better looking   more powerful since i added a venom computer module which totaled my horsepower to nearly hp   and my car will last just as long with its warranty remember   this is epinions   meaning it s my opinion i b exterior b the new model designs i don t particularily like i am more into a bigger car    or if it s smaller and sportier like the new mustangs   i would like them with a lower center of gravity and with a big sporty spoiler on the back i would ve liked it if they would ve come out with more of a japanese car like version of the if they wanted to create a more sporty version of the car   yet   with this edition of the   the car is small   not good for a four seater   and looks awful to me it doesn t really have a racer type look that tried to do with the vehicle    interior b   the changes compared to an older   model of the sport very few changes which make me disgust this car there are cheap plastic dash boards for one thing they look very potentially destructive in the way that even a little whap would break it the manual shift control is a pain in the butt not only is the car a manual   something i hate but have to live with   but the shifter blocks the controls to the cd deck   the climate control was bland   like in any i would recommend chevy s as being best for a nicely weathered interior getting into the back seat is much more difficult than i expected rather pain in the butt task to perform the car is kinda low    and elderly   or just plain old   people will have trouble getting into the small back of the car it is more suited for    year olds   the unspacious trunk of the car is another bad part of the model if you want a big truck with a sporty look   i d recommend getting a chevy monte carlo    engine b   the new v engine is pretty nice with a   l with hp which is nice   but not as good as my much cheaper monte carlo which has hp but   if you were to invest a little bit more money you could buy a v with hp and   pounds of torque if you ever put the pedal to the metal in a v model   you would feel that power immediately this thing will whip you back like a rag doll   if your thinking about getting a for the power   don t   a camaro will give you around a   l with a lot more horsepower for only a couple thousand more dollars    driven b   the drive is nice when you race it against another car   or just press the acceleration all the way   the car makes a nice rumble which will make you squeal like a school girl with excitement the handling of the car was decent it was a lot better than my monte being a much heavier vehicle   the monte is taking turns and corners    the handles nicely i would have to say    price b   the car is not a good deal at all   i would recommend buying an older if you were interested the only good thing about buying a car like this is that they are very easy to upgrade and modify thanks to numerous magazines devoted to it   where s my monte carlo magazine    versions b   the comes in either basic v form   a v gt engine   or a cobra style one which i am not sure how it handles but   my friend told me that a cobra is a lot more powerful and a lot more expensive as well    bottom line b if you have    to blow on a car   i would not recommend spending it on a buying a nice firebird with a v and a lot more horsepower and torque with a better interior and exterior look is a much better investment  
427,0,  this is my third time owning a   i purchased   gt convertible august    my dream car   this is my third and the other   had transmission and big engine problems   but i just knew this was going to be different   laserred   camel color top and leather seats   cd player   mach sound system and all the bells and whistles   the gas wasn t bad but the pick up wasn t as fast as i had driven in camero s and firebirds   when i had the top up   because of rain and most of the time i drove with the top down in the rain   as long as you drive you won t get wet   i could hear a humming noise in the rear of the car   every week it got louder   it just didn t squeal when i wanted it to   the car was sluggish   i had just turned in my   convertible   cylinder because there were transmission problems with it and i heard the   cylinder didn t have the same problems   wrong it ended up that some bearings or something in the rear end were no good to begin with   when we got the car back it seemed faster but over a few weeks time it began making noise again   we don t drive it fast all the time and we didn t do anything out of the ordinary to make this happen   this car was having problems from the moment we purchased it new   the leather seats were nice but they are low to the ground and your legs are extended so it is not as comfortable as a car but it s better than other sports cars i ve ridden in   the sound system is to die for   we live in south florida and it s hot there and we put the top up and the sun beats on the canvas and the a c doesn t compensate for the heat   the canvas lets the heat in the car   we sweat like a hore in church   that s how hot it gets in the summer riding in the with the top up    you would think they could build a car that would last   it isn t worth the money   for the third time i m disappointed   read my review on the   laserred convertible and the   white convertible i purchased a in   and was happy with it   not a problem   knows how to do trucks   but cars   that s a different story needless to say we traded the in on a   explorer sports trac we love it   we are cured of fever we miss the a lot   the dealer gave us     trade in after only   year and they are now selling it for      they will make a nice profit on it   we felt that if we kept the vehicle that we would have continuous problems with the rear end and transmission br br  
428,0,  the new mustangs do nt really impress me that much   one of my best friends have one and i find it a pain in the butt to take people around in it   do nt get me wrong   the car looks allright bt inside unless you are in the fron seat you are going to be very unconfortable   the sound system in it sounds nice even without the subs he added   he s got a   cylinder and it feals like its got alot of power but only   hp my truck can out run that but of coarse i have a standard   having a cd player and a tape was a good thing   it takes corners well and its ok on gas the mustangs have gone way down in price   i think that is why they are becoming a little more bland   when i was looking for a car i test drove a   gt and i was impressed wth everything except the size of the back seat   i will write a epinion on it too look for it the carries a great name but they are turning int a   seater that really does nt have the power that it used to   ever since they stopped makin the    engines in   overall you get a car wth a small backseat   ok gas mileage   looks kinda nice   a name that every knows   sounds ok   it is great for my friend he is single and usually carries one friend   but only one friend   i would say get something with a little bigger back seat br br  
429,0,  i have never owned either a camaro or a   my opinion is based purely on my sporadic drives    my first impression of the is that i see it on the street way to frequently   everybody and their brothers   aunts   grandmas   cousins   and co workers has on   who would want to buy a car that everyone else has   not me   how am i supposed to show off in a car that everyone else has   the second thing   that really drives me crazy   about this car is the way it receives so much kudos for being more comfortable   sports cars should not be judged on comfort   if you want comfort   buy a buick   sports cars should tear up the race track and leave two black lines down the middle of the streets   the constant praising of the comfort on this car being better is really quite moronic   sure comfort helps   but sports cars should be judged on the length of the black strips left behind   o   the is a nice looking car   i do have to say that it looks slightly better than the camaro   it s a bit boxy but it still wins this battle   the stereo on this just really sucks   there is no other way of saying it   this stereo is a senior citizen s stereo in the way that it has little bass and needs to be cranked near full blast before it can satisfy a music lover   i guess they re pairing it with the   quot comfortable interior quot   to please their family car buyers   they definitely aren t pleasing the sports car enthusiast who wants to go tearing up the hiways with the tunes bumpin   on to the driving   i found that this car drove quite nice   it s pretty fast   can turn well and do all of the stuff that a real sports car can do   i didn t go test either cars sporty ability since the cars weren t mine to mess with   but from what driving i did do   it seems to handle nice and provide a pretty good ride   uhh i think the only other thing i   being someone who doesn t own one   can say about it is that the interior components look old   they are the same dials and stereo systems that used to be in the old f   s back before they changed to their space ship design   the components all seem functional   they just don t look flashy at all   the camaro s aren t a whole lot better   but they still are better    camaro   i will talk about the same things in the same order with maybe one or two additions   this car is not near as common as the   i might see one or two a day   and when i do   it s a treat   put on some shiny rims and flowmasters in this baby and your bound to get some attention   there s not as much competition to compete with   this car is less comfortable than the   but who cares   the front seats are fine by my standards for two people to go wherever they want to go   the back seats aren t too roomy at all   but sports cars don t need back seats   these seats were probably just designed to give grocery bags added comfort   o   but really   comfort is not a huge factor in buying a sports car   your in the wrong class of cars if that s what your looking for   even though the   stang gets the kudos for looks   i still think the camaro is a nice looking car   it does need an update   but it is still a really nice looking car   the ss version is extremely attractive   the camaro majorly wins the stereo battle between the two cars   this stereo is comparable to the stereo i had specially installed in my yukon   it is really an awesome stereo with a ton of bass and enough volume to lift you out of your chair   a definite pro in my book   driving both of these cars was a different experience for me because i was used to a big yukon but the   stang s driving position was a little higher which made it easier to get used to at first but the camaro s was just as good once you got used to it   when you drive a car that isn t yours   the driving position is always a little wierd   the camaro is one fast car   i had the chance to open the throttle to this bad boy and boy did it move   amazing   braking was good on both   the camaro s handling was a little better   i think   just my opinion though   everybody s different   i loved listening to the exhaust sound in this car   in the you just hear the buzz of the engine while in the camaro you hear the roar of the exhaust   definitely awesome   the components in this car are functional and are more modern than the mustangs   these components are logically placed and easy to use   got ta love that stereo   if i was to buy one i would probably buy a camaro because they look so awesome when they are fixed up whereas the s start looking a little unearthly   as nearly all of s vehicles do   with camaro s you can get more for you money   so i ve read in trend and just about every other auto magazine out there   once again   that stereo might make the decision for me though   it would save me a few thousand of having to upgrade the s   oh   and an addition on the camaro   you got ta love those t tops   what a compromise between a convertible and a coupe   they are really cool     
430,0,  i recently went on a trip to kentucky and i had to rent a car   i wanted a mid sized sedan but the rental office didn t have any   so they decided to   quot upgrade quot   me to this little car   i won t call it a sports car because it lacked the performance i would like in a sports car   and it was nothing compared to my monte carlo ss   even when it was all stock   i guess you can t compare apples to oranges though   the did only have a v   which had less power than my blazer s v   first i will start off with what i liked about the   i did like the way the exterior looked   it was quite stylish   with its angled curves   and fake ram air ducts   i also liked the sterio   it looked better than the ones in my chevy s   but did not put out the sound like them   it came with a fairly decent package   it had air   cruise   power windows and locks   a tape player   and a cd player   i also liked the cruise control on the steering wheel   it was much easier to get to than on my chevys which have it on the turn signal switch   that is about all i liked what i didn t like   which proves my theory that fords are made very cheaply   is the abundance of plastic parts in the interior   the doors were about    plastic   which made it very uncomfortable to rest my arm on it   it was cold in the mornings   and when it got hot during the day my arm would stick to it   the dash was also all plastic   and did not look good at all   every part of the car that i touched felt like it was going to break if i put any pressure on it   next is the lack of power   now i know it was only a v   so i don t want a million comments telling me how i should drive a     or a cobra and see if my opinion changes   i have driven a camero with a v   and i am not being at all one sided toward chevy here   it did have much more power   i tried to spin up the tires a little on the   and the only way i could was by doing a brake torque   the was not a bad car to drive   but it just wasn t a sports car   the ride was very bumpy   and when cornering   it felt like you are going to lose control   it had the sports car look   but not the sports car feel   i think i ll stick to my chevy muscle cars and trucks for now   my    monte ss is   times the car the is   thank you once again   the turned me completely off of buying a sports car br br  
431,0,  my father recently fulfilled his dream of owning a sports vehicle   he went out and purchased a brand spanking new blue convertable   i guess when you reach the age of   you can do whatever you please   when pop s showed up at my house with his new   quot toy quot   my first impression of the car was   quot wow quot   it sure was a beauty   and he didn t have to twist my arm to take a test drive   getting into the vehicle was quite an obstacle   i think this car is made for people under   feet tall   and it felt odd sitting so close to the road   i m used to driving my chevy full sized pickup   so this was a very unusual feeling for me   almost like sitting in a little go cart   lowering the top was pretty easy   once i figured out that i had to have the car in   quot park quot   and the   quot emergency brake quot   set   then   with a simple push of a button   the roof smoothly went down   away we went   not as powerful as i expected a sports car to be   but a very smooth and comfortable ride   you ve got to really pay attention to the speedometer because it s easy not to realize just how fast you re driving this baby   in fact   my stepmother got a speeding ticket within   weeks of owning this car   there weren t too many features in this particular   it did include a pretty decent stereo system with am fm radio   cassette player   and cd player   there were built in cup holders   and a covered compartment for storing things   the a c works great   automatic seat adjustments   mirror adjustments   windows   and locks   sure   it was thrilling driving this toy around   i particularly enjoyed the looks on my neighbor s faces as i passed them by   but is this car worth the price just to impress people   i think not   as a family man   this vehicle would not make a good choice   there is very little room for passengers in the back seat   and they must have very short legs to even have some remote comfort   feeling pretty cramped   i just can t imagine making a long trip in this car   if you re single   have the money   the insurance is outrageous   and enjoy expensive showy cars   this one is for you   personally   once the novelty had worn off   i was glad i own a truck br br  
432,0,  i test drove this vehicle and i have to say that it was really nice   decked out   and it gave a smooth ride   but   it was very tight for space on the inside   if you usually travel in your car with more than one person other than yourself   i would not recommend this car   although   if you want something sporty and nice   i would definitely get this car    although everyone else already has one   i would recommend the   mercury cougar for everyone   be sure to check my review on the new   model mercury cougar v   sport coupe   the car is magnificent br br  
433,0,  considering a new   gt   think twice   in fact   don t think about it at all   i m on my fourth late model and definitely my last   the quality of the vehicles has gone down hill over the past two years and fords service and support structure is even worse the car has been in the shop constantly since i purchased the car new late last year   it still has unresolved problems that both the dealers and are unable to diagnose and fix   i ve communicated with several other   gt owners with similar problems ruling out the possibility that my is anomaly the car has excellent power for the price paid   is fun to drive and looks good with the top down   handling is good once the stock tires are replaced with a set of real performance tires   however   the rigidity of the car is marginal   several rattles and squeaks are present and one might think the car was going to   quot fall apart quot   over rough roads the key statement here is   quot for the price paid quot   if you can t afford a real performance car and are willing to put up with marginal quality and poor service   then this is the right car   just be sure to sell it before the warranty expires br br  
434,0,  what is wrong with this car   you ask everything the   gt is a total lame excuse for a sportscar   i purchased a   red gt in november of    i was the first in my town to have one of the new bodystyles   the car was loaded   with sunroof   leather   cd with the premium speakers   all power you name it this car had it i was happy with my decision to buy a until the car wouldn t start one morning   my little red   stang was only   months old and had less than k miles on her   i phoned the dealership and explained my problem   they didn t even seem surprised and they weren t apologetic or understanding   after waiting three hours   and missing a day of work   the wrecker showed up and took my pretty red to the dealership    wait   i thought    i don t have transportation now i phoned and asked for a rental or loaner car   their reply    i can give you the number to hertz car rental great   i thought   and is going to pick up the bill   right   wrong   told me i was on my own come to find out   the alternator had gone bad   replaced the alternator and i picked up my car the following morning   no big deal   right that very day the driver s side window wouldn t come back up after i put it down   the had gone out back to the dealership with no rental car   it took them two whole days to replace the i was furious i went to the nissan dealership and test drove a maxima   that was not what i was looking for   a friend told me to drive a camaro z   i did just that the power   ride and handling was phenomenal   i had to have it   after picking up my pos gt   i took it straight to the chevy dealership   before anything else could break on it   and traded it in for a   camaroz   i will be writing my review of my new z in the near future if you re considering purchasing a   atleast drive a chevy first   i thank my friend everyday for referring me there   don t make the same mistake i did   i try to let everyone know about my mishap with the rustang and in doing so   i came across the following website fordtruckssuck seems i m not the only one who s had numerous problems with  
435,0,  a few years ago   in    i bought a new   i wanted to buy an american car   i didn t even think of getting anything else   i was trading in my f    i wanted better gas milage   something cute   the first morning after i bring home my little silver bullet   it won t start   has to come over and give me a new battery   i told them to come pick it up and take it back   i expect for the car to be able to start after having it for like   hours   no can do   it s now my car   i think i saw the paint turn slightly yellow   naw   must have been my imagination   it couldn t be turning into a lemon   built cars tough   so   i went to work in it   it was fine   for about a month then the squeaking started   the dash squeaked the whole time the car was on   the really annoying high pitched squeaking   then the cassette player broke   said it was my tape   ok   then it ate   more tapes   i want a new radio   ok bring it in   and i m just out for the cost of the tapes   i pick up my car   and guess what   same radio   i had got some hair spray on the clock and i could see that the same pots were still there   oh yeah   well   they knew that the radio wasn t replaced   they just didn t have one in   but the fixed the squeak   cool   so i had to make another appointment to come in and have it put in   the dash didn t squeak for almost   full blocks   after that the back seatbelt broke   then the front one   they wouldn t stay buckled   then the engine started having problems   then everything inside the car started breaking   everything made out of plastic   that had to move   open or shut broke   it s a   and has been in the shop   times     
436,0,  why oh why do people continually by the   the answer is because they are cheap and some people think that they look cool   the is a car that formerly had a proud heritage and used to stand toe to toe with the camaro and the pontiac firebird   now   decades later   the only car the base level v   powered can beat is the honda accord   the fact that   quot upped quot   the power output in the current generation v s just goes to show that owners everywhere were getting trounced at red lights by the gm faithful in their camaros and firebirds   is this not humiliating to a owner   can the loyalists hold their heads up proudly knowing that there are a plethora of more superior vehicles out there   the answer       yes they can   in the past the was am amazing car and it single handedly defined the   quot muscle car quot   genre   but the same can not be said for the of today   if i wanted a mid sized car that was reasonably quick and rather sporty looking   i would opt for an accord coupe   then at least i would know that my car would outlive me br br  
437,0,  the convertible is fast   good looking   and fun to drive   corvettes and bmws are great sports cars too   what if they were the same price   the decision is easy   the is a clear example of a car that is just too expensive   a convertible starts out at      of course the real sports enthusiast get leather and all the options   if you can t afford the options   then don t buy the car in the first place   the options are an integral part to the   abs   leather   spoiler   power seats   dual   and the smokers package   aka the cell phone package   doesn t everyone who drives a sports car have a cell phone   they should   anyway   my point is this   a starts at k   but add tax   warranty   all the options   delivery   and the price gets to      and this is the price for an lx version   not the gt or cobra   so i would rather take this money and buy a real sports car that is worth the money   i think the convertible should be worth     for everything   that is reasonable   i find the current cost not reasonable because there are many more prestigious faster cars out there   why not buy a used corvette   it will keep its value longer   a loses    of its value after only two years   or why not buy a brand new bmw   the entry level   series for     base   this will keep its value more and a bmw base model with no options is a lot more luxurious and more prestigious than a convertible loaded   whether or not it is a cobra or gt   it is your choice   but if you want to be noticed   have some prestige   and spend your money smart   then buy a corvette used or a new bmw   a is great   but it is just too expensive br br  
438,0,  this car has plently of power and handles well   also it is a pretty goos head turner in performance red unfortunately   mine has been plagued with problems   furthermore     especially my dealership   has been very unreceptive and downright mean   i have bought fords my entire life   expect for a little toyota pickup once    and this will be my last   it is unfortunate that this car was not tweaked a little more because it would be awesome   when i first bought it it wasn t even safe   the car would accelerate to wide open throttle from a stop   it was out of control   the only way i could stop it was to turn the key off   after k though   has been unable to trace other problems   for instance the car dies a couple times a week at least   during deceleration   it is embarassing and it is dangerous when it happens on a curve   they did fix the horn on the second try though   good car if you like to have a black box in your car and press a little button when you fear for your life  
439,0,  i know i wrote an similar review on the lincoln navigator   but these suvs are identical and the same information applies to bring up a few important points about large suvs to consider before purchasing   as you know   large suvs have been stirring up a lot of controversy lately that buyers should know about   i recently purchased a new car   but considered an suv first and did a lot of research into them and promptly changed my mind   first of all   there are lots off hidden costs on large suvs   like the expedition   of course   unless you have      to spend on one   you are going to have a high car payment   which is obvious   most consumers expect this   but did you budget the high fuel cost as well   a expedition weights between    to    pounds   because of this   it has a v engine   which means it gets    miles per gallon or less average   meaning that a expedition driver is paying on average   to   times more for gas that a car driver   this will add somewhere between    to    a month to your car payment   okay   gas is cheap now but for how long   when it goes back up   typically the resale value on the expedition and other large suvs goes down considerably   no one wants something that is going to use that much gas when the cost is unsteady   that s a lot of money to lose   then there s insurance   because the expedition is big and heavy   if the driver gets into an accident   it will cause a lot of property damage and injuries that your insurance will have to pay for   on top of that   there is a big risk that the drivers or drivers family of the smaller cars will sue you   which means you and or your insurance could be out a lot of money   they plan for this by charging a lot higher premium on suvs than normal size cars   this can vary with no fault states   you should get a quote from your insurance first   now   on average   the expedition puts out over   times the carbon dioxide of a normal sized car   this really angers people who care about the environment and causes them to do things to protest against this   one of the popular things is   suv tagging   where they ll put bumper stickers on your suv say things like your changing the climate and you don t care about the air   please check out the sites i have listed below for more information on this   abcnews go sections us dailynews madtaggers html baaction org suvticket index html idontcareaboutair bumpers index shtml charm net marc chronicle suv may html poseur x org topten html this is a new trend and who knows where it will go   but do you want to constantly worry about your expensive expedition being vandalized and then pay for the repairs   that s just more costs to worry about   like keeping your vehicle in your garage   not the expedition and most large suvs   they won t fit unless you have a custom oversized garage another expense   but   if you leave is outside   it s always dirty and that s a lot of suv to wash or have washed   one more popular misconception about large suvs is that they are safer for families   for the most part   they are not   especially the expedition   it s based of the f   chassis which has terrible ratings because it is still a truck body with out properly designed crumple zones or a firewall keeping the engine out of your lap   please check iihs org first   the new vw beetle gets better crash test ratings that most lincoln suvs and trucks   do your research first on any suv   i recommend outlining why you need an suv   maybe a minivan would be better because you can save     to      have a safer   more versatile vehicle and get better gas mileage   take the money you saved and use it for kids college or early retirement   or maybe a vehicle that large is not needed at all  
440,0,  i love my boyfriend dearly but his car is another story   his   lx is a car i d love to shoot over and over again   i have had just as much experience driving this car as i have had riding it in   driving it didn t use to be so bad until the car s mileage went up and of course   so did the repair bills   the car was bought with about    miles and it is now up to about    miles but at least it s still running barely now i can understand that once a car gets older that repairs are going to be needed but it s getting to the point it is worse than mine and i didn t think that was possible the engine in his car is a   cylinder with   from the specs i saw researching on the web   is   hp   i almost laughed when i found this out   at least it beats a chevy metro   surprisingly though   i was in disbelief on how little it had   if i m wrong guys correct me   because for a four cylinder it was pretty quick off a dead stop   from what i understand also is that this car is pretty heavy so i am impressed with this little engine   i will say though that the gas mileage hasn t changed that much on the car   except in cold weather   and it gets about   city and about   on the highway   at least with this car going to the gas station is a little less frequent then in my car   the handling   many many miles ago used to be pretty loose and somewhat stable and then i had more control over the car   as time passed and mileage increased the handling became slowly worse to the point that if my hands aren t holding the wheel with a tight grip the car doesn t want to stay straight and more and more the steering is getting very tight   i honestly never feel sure of myself driving this car anymore   you could say try an alignment job thing is   with this car you can t afford the money to keep up with the repairs   the heat in the car really can t be considered heat and the air conditioning in the summer is non existent and for someone like me who can t handle heat this a problem   there is also a possibility that this car also has a carbon monoxide leak and i have been encouraging my boyfriend to have that checked out as soon as possible   i really don t like the interior of his car either   it looks too cheap and well   it s just not as stylish as the newer models   the controls are similar to the newer models but the dash is just downright cheesy looking the seats are pretty comfortable though except it s very hard to use the lever to make the seat go up because those are breaking too   the center console is broken and even the ash tray cover at one point broke   which was probably my fault   the glove box has a lot of trouble staying closed especially when going over bumps   forget about the back seat because with any you really can t consider it a backseat with how small it is   this car also doesn t have power seats or tilt steering so when i drive it   i basically need to sit on a phone book because without it i couldn t see the road   to top that off the wiper blades sit too high and can sometimes block my vision of the road the driver and passenger side windows are ready to break and are very loose and you can tell any time you go over bumps   the suspension is shot   if you hit a bump hard you are going to feel it big time   in fact   one side of the car appears to lean a little bit   with new brakes the car will come to a stop in a very short amount of time if you have to slam on the brakes but with worn brakes start praying basically   the car has a very noticeable   very rough idle   i have sat in that car before for at least fifteen minutes or more and eventually got sick to my stomach because of how much this car shakes   sometimes at forty miles per hour the rpms seem to stick and the car vibrates a lot   if anyone has any idea what that is please let me know   my car does that too   i will say though when you hit the pedal to the floor it makes a very nice sound   i love to hear an engine roar   even if it is a four cylinder i can honestly say that i wish he had never got it   the amount of money he has spent and still needs to spend on this car is absurd   the car is in need of some more repairs and i m sure of it   it seems like you can never keep up with this car   it s almost saying   quot please put me out of my misery quot   half the time   it would be easy to say   quot well   get all the repairs done and you should be fine quot   problem is   repairs were done and shortly after more problems came around   i know it is an older car and i know it has a lot of miles on it but for the amount of things to break it gets to be too much   the exhaust system   for example   was replaced and six months later it goes again and a new one is needed   the transmission even needed to be rebuilt but perhaps that was just age maybe if had made better quality parts that lasted maybe this car would not have had so many problems   i have written this as a warning to anyone who would consider buying a used of this year or before   you may end up like my boyfriend sinking buck after buck into this car just for things to keep breaking on it and wanting to pull your hair out   if you are young and just starting out like the two of us   being able to afford cars like these may be a challenge if your luck is as bad as ours   it is a nice looking car and a lot could be done to it appearance wise to make it look even better but i really don t think this car is worth the trouble   and with new jersey s stricter inspection laws both my boyfriend and i are most likely going to have to take out loans just to keep our cars on the road to appease new jersey regulations   but my view on these new laws is for another day     
441,0,  now i can t say everyone will have the exact same experience   but i recently sold my    after it broke down   times in less than   months   i ve sunk well over twice the cost of what the car s worth into repairs   for the record   i wasn t the one who purchased this car   it was my ex husband s   quot gift quot   i m a mother of two little kids and we ve been broke down and stranded on the side of the road because of this car time and time again   i ve had to replace the battery   alternator   battery connectors   correct a short in the electrical system   the time belt   clutch   two tires   catalytic converter   and something that was wrong with the radiator and exhaust   the car s ac system would have cost over     to fix after it died out and i didn t even bother to check what the problem was when the heat went   i just got rid of it   to hear this you might think this car went through some rough terrain or was driven a lot   but it wasn t   to school   the grocery store   doctor s visits   and not much more   now that i m in the purchaser s seat   i m buying a toyota camry   i have never had a more unreliable   costly   and problematic vehicle than that   if you re a young guy or a mechanic who doesn t mind walking or being without a car in spite of the fact that you own a car   then this one s for you   however   if you don t enjoy being stranded and you require reliable transportation then i would suggest your driving something   anything   else br br  
442,0,  you know i think back to the nasty car i used to drive and i was happy to get rid of it   i think if you work really hard   you deserve to treat yourself   so at the end of   i bought my   i wasn t too crazy about the new body style at first but i grew to like it   i do have a few complaints however   i owned the car for a month when i started noticing that a rust problem that was beginning on my tail pipe so i made an appointment and brought it in   they replaced the tailpipe   they told me it must have just been a bad part   then i started noticing that when i turned the wheel the car kinda made a grinding noise and and this humming noise   so yet again i took it in and they told me my car had no power steering fluid in it   how can they sell a brand new car with no power steering fluid   so they filled it up and sent me off   a couple weeks later the rusting started again   i made another appointment and brought the car in   this time when i brought it in   i made the mechanic get on the ground underneath my car so i could show him the rust   i was starting to think i was think i was going crazy   he told me that my car had more rust on it than a five year old he had just worked on   luckily this time they were kind enough to give me a loaner since they kept my car for several weeks   i mean i paid for a and i spent half the time driving a taurus   if i wanted a family car i would have bought one   shortly after that i joined the military and my car sat at home for six months and wasn t driven at all   when i came home to my surprise   what was there more of   rust   i have since had the parts replaced again   now the newest problem i have is my alignment   which after i took it to the dealership i was told that it will never be right because the body was cut wrong    i have no idea what that means oh and by the way   that humming and grinding   it s starting again a few days ago i m not saying they re all like this but from what i heard it s quite common     
443,0,  update on august      i need a new a c compressor and coil   adding another     to the repair bill   so in my first   months out of warranty   i ve replaced    idle control valve   summer        abs modulator   may        rear differential gears   may        a c compressor and coil   aug      plus had to pay for a car rental during three of the above total      including tax and car rental i ve rounded down in the above   plus you can add routine maintenance to that figure   without my extended warranty   which picked up over    of the above   i would have been much better served by simply leasing a new car for   years rather than keeping my car for this additional year i ve also changed my buy recommendation from a   yes   to a   no   keeping in mind that this review is for a   car   if you are buying leasing a new car under warranty   go for it   it s still fun to drive    original review from may   first off   let me say   i love driving the car   i have a manual transmission gt   when i don t do a lot of heavy braking   it s extremely fun   and there s nothing more satisfying during rush hour than blasting around some guy that s going to slow for your mood the main reason for writing the review is to share with people some of the less documented potential pit falls   my biggest beef with the car   and with   is my braking system   approximately   months after buying the car   and literally over night   my brake pedal went soft   i can depress it    without noticeably observing a change in speed   more scary than this   on an occasion when i emergency braked   the pedal went all the way to the floor   the abs did kick in   but it was scary   and   if i brake heavily while the tires go over bumps   the braking pressure becomes inconsistent   not to mention that steering goes to hell to   needs support   i ve twice rolled into the middle of intersections because of this   it s been to two different dealerships over four separate occasions for this specific problem   and no diagnostics have ever convinced these guys to replace anything   so i drive on   if the dealership won t recognize a problem   i guess i just don t have one   right the second thing you may want to be aware of   is that at    miles   and a little under four years old   the car needed    worth of work   the abs system failed   i have no idea if this is related to my first brake problem   but replacing the abs modulator did not fix that problem   and my differential fell apart   a bearing went bad and ended up chewing the gears there   those   plus the rental car i needed during repairs   plus the    mile service     added up to my    bill   i m also not writing because i m mad about the cash outlay   i have an extended warranty that covered most of this expense   i do think that    is an extensive bill for non accident related repairs to a   or   year old car beyond these things   i ve had my door handle tightened up as it was falling off and my clutch replaced   although that may have been due to me learning how to drive the car   and not doing the shifts correctly i don t pretend to know if this is a reflection of a normal gt   or i m just unlucky   i will say that i take pride in the things i own   and i take care of the car   oil changes and regular services   and i don t abuse it with donuts etc    although i m awfully tempted sometimes   hope this helps you potential buyers out there   as a side note   the seat head rests are useless   but as i point out to my friends   you don t buy this car for it s reputation of comfort or reliability   it s all about the fun  
444,0,  i am a young woman and a first time car buyer who grew up around cars   i have always wanted a true   quot muscle quot   car and when i had the chance to purchase a new    i did   it was the car of my dreams   well   actually a    gt fast back was but beggars can t be choosers i bought my car in canada at a reputable dealer and was thrilled   not long after i moved to the city for a new job   i had never had any problems with my car and i loved it but as luck would have it little things started to happen well   i have now had my car for a year and a half and slowly but surely things have started to deteriorate   i have had my heat sheild replaced twice   my side mirrors have been replaced because the gears that drive them have gone bad   my transmission is going already   there is a major lack of power when going up hills   for the longest time my brakes would work when they felt like and according to the computer system in my car there is nothing wrong with it   i am writing this simply to warn all prospective buyers   please   please   please take the car for a long test drive first   make sure that where you purchase the car they are willing to listen to you when you tell them there is something wrong   and last but not least   search the internet for horror stories on any car you are going to purchase before you do   you find out a lot more about a car that way then what the salesmen are willing to tell you br br  
445,0,  the has really made a great car with there new convertible and witht the hard top   the car has plenty of power along with a great design that will turn heads everywhere   one of the best parts about the car is that it has a roomy enough seat to have an average sized adult sit back there   especially when the top is down   it is a little cramped   but much better than most other convertibles   it has an electric top which makes it easy to get out in the sun with just a push of a button   the car has plenty of power to get the wheels spinning   and you won t need to bring extra fuel tanks   it does pretty well on gas mileage   one of the down sides to the car   is that it looks as if the outer molding is very much like thinplastic   and woul probably break in an accident   however   it still looks really great   and for kids    or adults that act like kids   it is a great car br br  
446,0,  i had a    hyundai   speed and wanted to step up   what i really wanted was a    cougar but the salesman was just too much of an idiot to deal with a women buying a car   so i went to another dealer   and he treated me well and i bought the exact same car that is in the picture above   love that red car   the engine and drive train are great   the rest of car is the problem   the whole driver side of my car is incorrectly installed   from the dashboard to the door to the outside trim to the interior window molding   i have had them rip out my dashboard to find a rattle   they can t find it but we all can hear it   they have replaced my hand brake   they have replace the rear window and molding   and unfortunately   it is slightly better than when it went into the dealer   there are now stains on my seats   tools left inside   my manual is now under the hand brake console   on the up side   it is a guy magnet br br  
447,0,  this is an update of my adventures with this car i ve had it for more than a year now   i ve driven back and forth to portland four times   i moved once in it   i ve taken it up a mountain pass twice   and you know what   i don t like it any better   it s been towed at least three times   gotten two flat tires in a month   and had to walk or borrow other people s cars far too often   just when i think i have everything taken care of   and am beginning to grow fond of it   the car betrays me again   it truly breaks my heart   a guy s first car should be something he can be fond of or something   not a pos that he hates with all his soul and curses regularly   the transmission fell out one and a half times before i just bought one and handed it to a mechanic   i have scars from this car   it hates me   too   i m sure   this is not my fault   as i loved it at first because it was my car   and it was zippy and fun   and it was wheels   now it is my wagon of the devil and we disrespect each other equally negatives   maybe i got a lemon   brakes go from fine to shot in no time at all   front wheel drive makes it extremely hard to do routine maintenance on   the body is easily succeptible to damage   the tire and brake wear is very uneven   positives   does not guzzle oil   once you get a good tranny in it   will wear for a long time   gas consumption extremely efficient b original material   i see millions of these on the road   and i notice that all of them are lx s   that s the model with a stereo and a c   i bought   about four months ago   a grey pony at the beginning of the summer   it had a stereo and a c   never do this   the a c fell out   literally   causing me to have to work on the serpentine belt almost all summer long   the engine runs really hot   and the seals around the axles gave out almost immediately   once i got used to running this car without a c   it seems to run really efficiently   not needing any thing to be changed much   and with very little maintainence   i should also point out the speedometer lead fell off   and i racked up at least a   miles that will never go on the odometer   this is pretty disappointing   my parents had an areostar van they ran into the ground   and it went forever   i haven t even cracked    miles yet   and it s already sounding like it s going to come apart around my ears   i probably won t for a long time   but who wants to drive a car that sounds like it could fall apart at any moment   doesn t impress the ladies much   for a budget car   if you can get a model like this that wasn t jerry rigged by some swine in a used car dealership   it will probably serve you well   my sister got a car like this   wagon   at the same time   only two years newer   and hasn t had a single complaint   so go the little extra and buy a   lx   you won t notice the difference   because you ll have a car that won t have anything perpetually going wrong   before i complain too much   i should point out that i really like the lines of this car   and for a cheap pile of junk   it hauls pretty well   and i like it even though i complain thanks for reading my opinion  
448,0,  i drove a   tbird on a long road trip in the winter of    the type i had was a fully equipped v lx with every option available   this included leather   dual exhaust   moonroof   jbl audio   etc m overall impression of the car was favorable   but the sheer size of it makes it undesirable   before i get to that   here are the plus points   first of all i simple love the dash   the way it curves and wraps around the driver is something that is just amazing   it makes you feel extremely secure when you re in there   the guages and controls are easy to read and very logical in design   all switches and latches feel high quality mechanically speaking   the car is a gem   the   l v is a modualr engine that is found in other cars   i e     so you can be assured that it is a tried and true   service for it must also be rather easy to get as are parts   the   hp   with dual exhaust   it puts out are   quot push you in your seat quot   ponies that remind you that you have a v   the taransmission is a little too conservative in that it forces you to floor it to reach redline in every gear   but fuel economy stays nice with that feature   the ride is smooth and quiet   handling is typical for a big car   the rear end bobs and shakes a little   but absorbs road imprefections nicely   the rear wheel drive set up is also a huge plus point   fwd cars tend to be more expensive to service and require more services   i e   cv joints   now the bad part   this design is basially one that used since    the first tbird with this body and the   model are light years appart in refinement   but it doesn t look to be that way at a glance   alos   big american cars tend to look really tachy after they age only a few years   i can t imagine spending over   k on this thing and have it be a laughing stock of a car in   years   acura legend coupes would be a much better buy   even though they are fwd   should be commended for staying committed to the v rwd personal coupe   but it s an idea whose time has come and gone   the reintroduction of the   tbird made to look like the   model is simple a horrible attempt to retro a car   using the lincoln ls   which btw is a import copy stolen mitsubishi diamante front end   bmw headlights   and acura style front bumper   parts and rebadging them is in poor taste   i hope this car flops and learns to stop selling   amp amp   to buyers   the story on the   woudl have been different if they designed a v exculsive to the tbird and real retro styling like metal dashboards   with airbags   huge white wall tires   and sealed beam look hid lighting systems   in other words   stop making cars look like jelly beans give the people fins   and an exhaust that exits through the rear bumper br br  
449,0,  the taurus has survived almost   consecutive years since its first year in production   that s more than many cars that have come and gone over the last   years or so   so why is the taurus so successful   it certainly has not received the best reliability ratings   the ride is anything but smooth   and despite being relatively cheap in cost   the taurus has never offered an extraordinary value   on a recent trip from eureka to san francisco the    taurus gl sedan provided decent transportation   but not without the typical problems so often associated with the mysteriously popular taurus   for the    model year the taurus comes in   trim lines    body styles   along with   different engines and   optional transmissions   trim lines body styles include the base gl sedan   tester   and wagon   lx sedan and wagon   and the sho sedan performance trim line   the base trims come with an ohv    v   tester equipped   and an ohv    v both producing   horsepower and both coupled with an axod   speed fully automatic transmission   the sho trim comes standard with a    dohc v when equipped with the   speed manual or a    dohc v when equipped with the optional   new for      speed automatic    driving impressions i with only    miles on the odometer my    taurus gl tester felt like it was on its proverbial last leg   off the line   acceleration   is adequate with very little wheel spin torque steer   however under full throttle the    ohv vulcan engine feels and sounds more like an unrefined   cylinder than the v that it is   despite being somewhat slow   it was the transmission behavior that was the killer   under full or even partial throttle the transmission clunks into gear   letting the driver know each time it up shifts or down shifts   the worst part of this   speed automatic transmission is its low speed operation   when driving between    mph and punching the throttle   the transmission would many times slip completely out of gear revving the engine towards redline   only to eventually clunk back into gear when letting off the throttle   i m not new to this feeling   i have owned   tauruses and a mercury sable in the past to find similar transmission issues   i have also found the   models to carry some of these same transmission characteristics   like many mid sized family cars in the early mid s the taurus offers less than exciting   handling    the handling limits on twisty roads are easily reached making the    taurus gl uninvolving and uninspiring in this department   body lean roll and lack of feel in the steering are the main problems here   the general brand p r   all season tires only aggravate the situation   while the taurus finds its home on the freeway   it s   cruising   abilities still pale in comparison to much of the competition for the    model year   the base gl model i drove offered some of the most unrefined highway cruising in a family sedan that had an original msrp of over      engine noise is kept to a minimum   even at   mph   however   wind and roadgrain noise are prevalent throughout the cabin at high and low cruising speeds   the    taurus gl also suffers severely from rattles   and sudden jolts when driving over small imperfections in the road   the    chevy lumina and   honda accord both do a much better job keeping their occupants in a hushed environment when cruising on the freeway   back roads   or even through town   hills climbing is adequate   i could not get the taurus gl to go up one large hill in top gear   although once the automatic transmission down shifted   again clunking into gear   the car could maintain a decent pace   but not without engine noise   and transmission fuss   if a used taurus is a must on your car shopping list   and if you live in mountainous areas   the    liter option is probably the way to go   this particular engine offers much better hill climbing power vs the ohv    b braking   was also poor   having a front wheel disc   rear drum set up without abs can be more than adequate for many cars   however it made for some scary moments going down steep hills in san francisco with this particular    taurus   the brake pedal felt extremely spongy   and i found myself many times flooring the brake pedal just to get this car to stop   my mercury sable ls had this same problem b fuel economy   is good   the epa rates the    taurus gl    at     i observed about   mpg overall on my trip from eureka to san francisco and back   the fuel tank is   gallons so fill ups are kept limited    interior accommodation i   the gl model i drove was bare bones   no amenity options   just basic everything   no power door locks   no power mirrors   etc   etc   dual front air bags came standard and so did an ashtray   instead of a cassette player that comes standard with most cars in   with a msrp of      my tester just came with an am fm stereo system with   speakers   a major gripe with the interior of the    taurus is all the exposed screws in the doors handles and in the plastic moldings around the doors and windows   one does not have to look very hard to find these exposed screws   the plastics also used in the cabin are extremely cheap looking   cheap plastics and exposed body metal around the window seals also contribute to this   put together with wood and glue   theme   seating is adequately comfortable   but the cloth bench seats in the front provide no bolstering whatsoever   and the rear bench seats are   full bench   so they do not fold down for added storage like the more accommodating    split variety interior room and cargo are by far the    tauruses strongest assets   unlike the   chevy lumina there is tons of head and leg room up front and in the rear   the taurus design provides very good use of the space provided   also allowing for a very large trunk i exterior innovation i   when the nd generation taurus was first seen in   it was all the rage   unfortunately by   these cars were getting quite dated looking   in   the futuristic yet ultra odd looking rd generation tauruses arrived making the nd generation seem even more dated   while not ugly by any means   i feel the    taurus is more of a practical somewhat handsome grocery getter design than anything sporty or otherwise    price reliability i   new   these cars could run close to     in top of the line sho trim   my tester had an msrp of      today the retail cost is about      i have seen these base modeled tauruses go for as little as     with the owner s claim that they   ran great   reliability has been very poor according to my own research with the st and nd generation tauruses   this particular taurus has had few major mechanical repairs as of yet   however   hoses   belts   brake rotors   thermostat   struts   front turn signal covers   and power steering lines had to be replaced in    miles of use   i would also like to note that the car is constantly needing front wheel alignments and i forecast a new transmission is already in demand i final thoughts i like the infamous hyundai excel   the taurus has showed us what it is made of over the years   while it has provided flawless transportation for many owners   it has created severe headaches for just as many   if not more owners   it s not only the reliability issues that has lead me to rate this car at   star   it is its overall build quality   ride   and lack of performance   if you are in the market for a used car in the       price range   i urge you to test drive as many cars as possible   some of my personal favorite cars in this class and price range between    would be the honda accord   toyota camry   and the nissan maxima looking for a slightly better built taurus   check out my review on the     a href content     taurus a     happy car shopping  
450,0,  about a year ago   my twin brother bought a   taurus with about k on it for     it seemed like a pretty nice car when we test drove it   so he bought it and it turned out to be a pretty cool car   his looks better because he added a spoiler   bra   and some chrome wheels   it is a sharp looking car   but he ended up having some problems with it power the   l v is not one of s best engines   though somewhat powerful in lighter cars it seems at some times strained by the weight and size of the massive taurus   it does ride pretty smooth though   about   months after he got it   the heater core went out   it was a   dollar repair   soon after they replaced that   the air conditioning would nt stay cold   they replaced the freeon   and it was cold   for about a week   apparently there was a leak or some type of problem   about another   to replace that mileage his taurus does not get good mileage at all   at one time it was getting only about   in the city   sure   driving with a lead foot was part of the problem   but   is still too low for a car with an engine of that type   he had the oxygen sensors   there are   of them in tauruses   for about    and that made it improve by about   or   mpg   still not very good   only about   on a full tank ride comfort it is indeed a comfortable cruiser   the one thing i did nt like is there was no p ower seat   so after being used to the one in my car    lumina euro   it seemed kind of flat   the car rides pretty smooth   and takes the bumps pretty well   i have driven this car and i do not like the way it handles   the complete opposite of my car   it is kind of a fake feel   by that i mean there is no real feel for the road   you can move the wheel with your pinky finger   some people may like that   he does   but not me   cornering could be better   at low speeds the taurus can pull u turns and sharp corners easily   once you get above   or   the car sways excessively   bigger tires would help   although the   s are ample styling tauruses are sharp looking   although kind of bland   if you like a car that is nt very sporty looking and that blends in with the crowd   then they are for you   i do nt reccomend this car   apparently other tauruses have been known to have transmission problems that are very costly   if you want a similar sized and similar priced car that has been proven to be more reliable and just a better car   then i recommend you check out the chevy lumina   just a      s had brake trouble altogether it s not a bad car   some like it   some do nt   it has been known to have some trouble   but there are many cases of people not having any trouble at all   i do nt really recomend it just because i feel there are better cars in the early   s   door sedan market  
451,0,  just a warning this is a review of the taurus station wagon   not the sedan the car is nice   not amazing   but nice   its a good family car   good steering   but both the braking and acceleration feel unresponsive   the brakes have to be pushed pretty far down before they start working   and it always feels as if the engine is trying to catch up with my accereleration furthermore   my transmission has started to die   the transmission is always banging into place the car   however   has been very reliable   it has    miles on it   and has only been in the shop for a new head gasket   it has not even needed a new timing belt   which   to the best of my understanding   is expected to break after    miles br br  
452,0,  i knew that it was pretty the moment i saw it on the lot   it was so gorgeous   coming and going   i was proud to drive it   when i drove it   however   i never knew when i was going to get home first month   run sluggish when hot   we live it houston   texas   it will always be hot   that is not a good sign   however   frequently it would just not run   it would just suddenly stop second month   tire separation   we are cruising along the freeway   toodling along and the rear tire completely separates   thanks to some firestones that came on the car   and not only did we get a flat tire   but the tread separation took the rear bumper off   lovely third month   mounts and wheel rotors   okay   fine   it was used   it had less than k miles on it   maybe that was reasonable   coolant flush   why   smelled funny to the mechanic   coolant smelled burnt   i blamed the service station for trying to pull a fast one   my bad fifth month   over heating   again   called   nope   not their problem   whose problem   do not know   but said not their problem   fine   sixth month   transmission   slipping on corners   great   i know what a v is supposed to sound like when cornering under a freeway over pass   this is definite slippage   high rpm s no increased acceleration   solution   new transmission seventh month   hard starting   wonderful   i am loving this car more each day   solution   new battery   this is not my idea of fun   i want to go out into the garage and just get in and go   i do not want to plan ahead each day for when i will need a jump start eighth month   more over heating   mechanic still ca nt find the problem   i am learning to nurse it by turning off the air conditioner and keep it going so that the breeze would keep the water cool in the radiator   it would limp home ninth month   rotor cap and wires   anything to convince it that it would start in the morning and not burn up batteries tenth month   serious serious money spent on the best truck battery   interstate   that would definitely turn this car over the radiator eventually cracked   the head gaskets eventually did blow   out of warranty   and the transmission did go out again   all within    miles     customer service sucks   i will never ever buy or recommend any ever again the room in the car was unparalleled   the class of arriving in this car was great   it is a pretty car   but sadly the car itself mechanically was horrendous   i am religious about maintenance   about repairs as soon as there is a problem   i have never hated a car before   but i hate this car  
453,0,  we bought our   taurus in   when it had k mi on it   the car was in pretty good shape   i traded it in today at k mi   in the one years time and k mi we have had the car i have had to replace the water pump   serpintine belt   thermostat   brake pads   rotors   brake lines and other various suspension parts i traded the car because it needed another    worth of work   the axn transmission had justed started to slip    requiring a rebiuld to fix   the rear calipers froze and needed replacing   since the calipers froze it ruined the rotors so they also need replaced   the front struts and c v joints are shot and need replaced   i also needed to have the engine looked at as the transmission shop informed me that it was giving some engine error codes also the car was a roomy and okay to drive   can t handle corners too well   i hardly can believe that quality is job   at br br  
454,0,  dear readers i think i have to start with a sad note   saying never dare to burn yourself buying this vehicle   i bought this vehicle in last september   i think i must have gone crazy when i bought this   i was actually misguided by its look for a   model and the comfort it might offer for its size   later realized it s nothing but money eater   what i like in this vehicle mm what could i say   probably the size to accommodate more friends of mine who don t have a car   my list of hatred started with the problems    after just a week of buy i found that the engine bed bolts were weak and i had to change them    two months later it was recalled for tightening the side frame bolts uh   i didn t know what it was and what the dealer did   no comments and details from the dealer    three months later i had to change the rear wheel brake rotor   caliper   and shoes since there was misalignment with the caliper which eventually dug into the rotor disk    now came the real big headache   the oil pressure lamp started to glow   i didn t knew what exactly was happening   few days later i found out that the engine coolant was getting dried up soon and also the engine was heating up sometimes   i am not a person who doesn t care for cars   actually i luv to do   now i added higher viscosity oil   but after few days of oil change the lamp started to glow again   i took it to the dealer   then he confirmed my fate that my engine was no good   what   yes the timing case gasket which is at the lower part of the vehicle has some defects and now the water has started to enter the engine chamber   oh my god   what can i do now   either replace engine or scrap the vehicle i tried contacting the   but nothing worked out   the which was then offering warranty for head gasket leakage   didn t offer the warranty for this   i was helpless   and now my car stands in my apartment parking garage for no mistake of mine except for that i bought a vehicle from my perspective except for those people who lease the vehicle or take rentals shouldn t go for this when there are cars which could easily run for    rd s of your lifetime br br  
455,0,  i own a   taurus   granted i should have done some more research   but i didn t   it was purchased in    so it was only a couple of years old   fairly low miles   and i had seen the blitz about how safe the car is   it s a family mobile   you can even window lock the car so the kids can t roll down the windows   nice touch   the car is a v    but sure doesn t act like one   it s pretty slow getting started   but at least the ride is smooth here are things that they don t tell you   and it cost me dearly   my car started to have trouble getting into reverse   it was idle there for a bit   then literally   quot kick quot   into gear   it s scary   it feels like the car is shaking apart   then it started to do that when i put into drive   sometimes it would stall as well   i was getting really worried   so i go online and start checking my problems   it seems there is a manufacturing problem with certain years of the taurus   some of the parts are made out of aluminum   when it should have been made out of steel   there were even some lawsuits involved   and of canada noted this as a problem and agreed to fix some of those cars   this   of course   does not apply to of america   in fact when i called   they told me there will be no financial help for a deficiency in their part   so what was the resolution   let s just say it cost me about   month worth of rent   i had to have a rebuilt transmission   if i had gotten a new transmission   i could be in the same boat again   it really wasn t worth the time   or the effort   i don t know   maybe i am a bit bitter   but i ll never buy again   especially for the fact that it is a known problem   yet they do nothing about it br br  
456,0,  i bought my   taurus used in    it had    miles on it   after   year   the transmission refused to enter into any gear   this required   dollars worth of transmission rebuild work   four months later the transmission decides it wants to pick and choose when it will go into drive   turns out that a valve sticks   a little tranny lube solved this problem   five months ago the surpentine belt tension froze   destroying the pulleys on the water pump and power steering pump   another    dollars   one month ago   the headlight switch wiring harness completely melted   leaving me stuck at night with no lights what so ever   i recently ran across a recall list for this model year of taurus and was astonished   there are no less than seven recalls for it on the bright side   the engine has run completely trouble free   and the car is very comfortable on long trips   and with    miles on it   still has plenty of power readers   please research your next used car purchase very carefully brian   
457,0,  the taurus was a great car when we bought it in    low mileage everything worked fine   and extremely comfortable but then   came and boom   at    kilometers the air conditioner quit at    kilometers the head gaskets blew   then at    the transmission had to be completely rebuilt   this   taurus gl was equipped with the    engine   i have learned never to buy a product with the    engine   the car is now gone to the scrap yard at    kilometers this car was a very expensive lesson to learn did rebate the money for the head gaskets but not for any of the other repairs which i believe happenned due to the faulty    engine whatever happenned to cars lasting   years   keep in mind as you read this article that i have used kilometers not miles    kilometers      miles br br  
458,0,  i came from a family   and after driving a sports car for   years   decided to purchase a   taurus gl early in    finally   a nice riding car with lots of space   it did great for the first two years   after that   boom   at about    miles it started overheating   and the transmission did not want to shift into gear   that s when i took it to my local reputable transmission repair shop   it would cost     to fix or     for a temporary fix   the shop says it was such a high price because they would have to remove the   and all the air conditioning equipment   i opted for the temporary fix   that part went just fine until i realized several months later that the transmission problem caused a broken mount   now   i had a whole new array of problems   the shifting around caused a hole in the air conditioning hose resulting in     worth of repairs   next a freeze plug blew   of course it was the one at the back of the   so out came the again for another     lo and behold   upon reinstalling the transmission was jerking again resulting in a punctured oil filter   i m now praying that this car holds over a little longer until i can afford to find another ride br br  
459,0,   ever had one of those optical illusion books with pictures that looked like an old lady at one glance and then a young lady looking away at another   how   bout the one that looks like a woman looking in a vanity mirror at one take   and then like a skull at the next   the same effect was revisited for me recently when i first saw the    explorer sport trac    allow me to explain b you see   up until now   sport utility vehicles have been a well defined group   many of them are built on pickup truck frames   i e   the durango   nissan xterra   the explorer sport trac is actually a reversal of this trend    it s a   pickup truck   that is based on an   suv    namely the explorer    for you automobile savvy epinions members   yes you ve stumped me   the explorer   was   originally based on the pickup   however   the explorer has since become more rigid and heavier than its pickup cousin   you can see how i had a tough time figuring out what to make of the sport trac i had originally hoped that the dealership where my friend works would receive a delivery of sport tracs soon   alas   it was not the case   so   i placed a call at a large dealership in town requesting immediate notification when the first sport tracs rolled onto their lot   sure enough   my call came and i was at the dealership in no time     note b   normally   my reviews are based on test drives that take at least a full day   since this was a new model   however   i could only drive it for about an hour   which is actually very generous of the dealer   i plan on driving the sport trac again once my friend s dealership gets some in stock   when i do i ll update this epinion and remove this disclaimer   for now   however   consider this a   quot short drive quot   review i b exterior     i ll let you draw your own conclusions about the way the sport trac looks   what i have rated so highly is the   design   behind the truck   there is much to tell   so get ready although the sport trac was built on the explorer frame   its dimensions are different   it s    quot   longer than the explorer   and about an inch wider   in order to compensate for this length increase   the sport trac was modified to   improve lateral rigidity   by   essentially   what we have here is a explorer that had its rear chopped off and converted into a pickup bed   the bed itself is not made out of metal   but sheet molded composite plastic   supposedly   it can withstand   pounds of impact per square inch   so claims it s just as good if not better than steel in a car crash   the bed itself holds    cubic feet of cargo   which is about   cubic feet less than the cargo bay behind the rear seats of a regular explorer   optional on the sport trac is a cargo cage bed extender which increases the bed space by    additional cubic feet of space   in addition   you can fold the    rear seats to accommodate still more cargo   whether or not that surpasses the   cubic feet total cargo space of the explorer is unknown to me the   cargo bed seems like it can stand up to some good use    tested the bed with solid blocks of concrete and not a scratch was found   ten tie down hooks make sure your cargo is securely held in place   an available option you might want to consider is a hard tonneau cover that protects your items   right now   they re hard to find but availability will be better soon   another nifty feature in the rear cargo bed is a weather proof   volt power point for whatever you d want to power up back there   camping lights   compressors   etc   the protective flip up cap reminds me of the caps on outdoor power outlets on the roof of the cabin    yakima   not   roof rails   offer more space to stow your belongings   they can hold   pounds of stuff when outfitted with the optional cross members b interior     the sport trac has many things going for it in this category and things i d like to see improved   first   the good the   dash is one of the best i ve seen on a    the instruments are clearly marked   and i especially like the black on white gauges   the air conditioner did well to cool the cabin in the   degree weather   the stereo system i had was the four speaker system   which was satisfactory   though i d opt for the   speaker option myself   another clever addition to the dash is an industry first   a power operated rear window   a dial on the right side of the dash can be tapped for lowering the rear glass by an inch   or turned to the left to bring the window down all the way   all of these controls were well within reach   looking down   i noticed the   floor of the sport trac is actually rubber   not carpet    this is great for keeping the car clean and according to the dealer has a hand in sound insulation   another feature you might find useful is the removable portion of the center console   it s actually a soft carrying pack for storing cd s   pens   papers   what have you   a final clever feature i noted was a clipboard that flips over for a second cupholder   neat o moving to the back   the   rear seats are quite roomy for a   quot pickup quot b   in fact   there is a full inch more of leg room than the explorer on which the sport trac is based   behind and under the seats   there are small cargo compartments for stowing little knick knacks having stated the positives   there were many things i would change about the interior   first of all   i did not find the bucket seats on my truck to be very comfortable at all   the water resistant cloth is all well and good for staying clean   but it doesn t feel that great on the skin   i also would have liked more lumbar support   there was very little   another negative was the   abundance of cheap plastic    not just on the dash but everywhere   that is endemic to all vehicles   when i shut the door getting out   i was met with a resounding   clang   and not the solid thud that i appreciate hearing on cars b engine     the    l    hp     rpm    lb ft   torque      v is the same engine uses in the explorer sport   and   scoots the sport trac along quite well    i was impressed with the engine s highway acceleration   which i got to test extensively   the sport trac is rated to tow    pounds   so the engine is good for light work only b handling     the sport trac s handling is very   sure and confident   for a truck   taking the car into a large parking lot   i swerved it left and right   noticing very little pitch   taking turnarounds can be accomplished almost at the speed of passenger cars without squealing the tires   as far as emergency maneuvers   the sport trac performs well   too   while driving on an access road   an idiot pulled out right in front of me causing me to swerve out of the way just in time   after i had recovered my composure   i was thankful for the sport trac s performance in that situation   and was happy to know the   quot soil proof seats quot   would be there for me should a need ever arise again b ride     the sport trac handles better than the explorer suv   no question   the ride   however   is   more stiff than the explorer    that may be good for some   bad for others   if you want a lofty ride   then the regular explorer is what you seek   not the sport trac   that said   i liked the way the sport trac rode   personally   yes   i felt the road more   but other qualities were pretty good   engine   road   and wind noise were all pleasantly muted at city speeds   at highway speeds   road and wind noise made themselves known   as far as the engine   however   i had to look at my speedometer to know how fast i was going because it gave me little help   that s a good thing b reliability     the sport trac is brand new for    so it has no proven track record   my truck s cargo cage rattled when i hit bumps   and i also noticed some weathered rubber on the seal of the rear window   these are little observations   but they may paint a bigger picture later   on that note   be advised that you should   be wary of any first year model    if you can   wait about a year for to iron the kinks out   if not   you might find yourself taking your sport trac into the garage for unscheduled maintenance or recalls   is not exempt from this dilemma   the redesigned   the explorer   and expedition all had numerous recalls on them their first model year   having said that   while my rating of   quot   quot   for an unproven car may seem unfair   and could be wrong   i m going on past history here   and am just making a point   at best   all vehicles end up giving you average reliability anyway food for thought b value     the sport tracs were surprisingly in good numbers when i visited the dealership   when i asked the dealer about it he said they were selling surprisingly slowly   i don t expect that will always be the case because i feel the sport trac will become immensely popular   this is something to consider though   if a dealer tells you they are selling like hotcakes and uses that as an excuse to jack the price up for a base target price of around      the sport trac comes in   a little pricey   when compared to other trucks that most closely resemble it   the nissan frontier   door and the dakota quadcab pickups come in       cheaper   albeit a little more bare   load the sport trac to the gills and it tops out at almost      a sizeable sum indeed argues that because the sport trac is actually an   suv   with a cargo bed and   not   just a pickup with four doors slapped on it   the sticker is well justified   well   i d love to agree with them about that   but the fact still remains that those changes are all underneath the skin   aren t the basic functions of the sport trac equal to the previously mentioned pickups anyway   don t they all make the attempt at blending suv and pickup characteristics   who cares where the starting point is   suv vs   pickup   remember that this is just my opinion   and i m sure others think otherwise   all i m saying is that the issue of   quot it s an suv   not a pickup quot   is all a matter of semantics   these important differences notwithstanding   by the way   the sport trac won t always be the only   quot suv turned pickup quot   on the market b the verdict   at first glance   what do   you   see b in closing   i think is really onto something here as far as new designs go   the sport trac is probably the best compromise between an suv and a pickup   that s just my problem with the sport trac   however   what you are buying is a   compromise    it s neither the best pickup nor the best suv on the market   in addition   this is an   introductory year    and i find it a bit pricey    for these reasons   put together i   i would not recommend it to a friend of mine b   my opinions may not speak for   you i   however   ask yourself   does this compromise fit   your   lifestyle   if so   then maybe you should give it a look     and when you look at the   quot optical illusion quot   that s rigged up   play the game for yourself   is it an suv or a pickup   hopes you ll see something entirely different   love at first site    average score     out of    b vara s personal rating     out of     
460,0,  yes this is an odd looking sports utility truck with a rear bed just a little over   feet long   the bed is about   feet in depth and   feet wide by   feet in length giving it only about   cubic feet in cargo space   after awhile you kind of do get use to the look the   explorer sport trac wd that are made after      base list price is for     without the destination charge it comes with a    liter sohc v   fuel induction sfi with   horsepower and   foot pounds of torque   the gas mileage rating is   mpg for the city and   mpg for the highway with a standard   speed manual with overdrive transmission   the automatic transmission   speed with overdrive gets   mpg for the city and   mpg for the highway when i drove it i was disappointed   it road rougher than i expected and it seemed top heavy on cornering   the performance of the v   was fair and it run a lot better when we run a premium gas in it the interior looked nice with two front air bags and a nice gauge layout for easy reading   the rear seat wasn t to bad   there was enough room for two adults and one child as long as the front seats were not all the way back   the back seat has three child seat tether anchors i didn t test the air conditioner   too cold outside   but   the heater worked great b standard equipment   air conditioning power front disc brakes and braking system with f r anti lock four cup holders power windows and door locks a   gallon fuel tank oil pressure   voltmeter and tachometer gauges power dual mirrors am fm stereo with cd    cassette and digital clock intermittent wipers three power outlets and more b cons   one thing i did not like is that the engine rattles occasionally using   octane   so you need to use a higher octane gas b warranty   gives you   years or    miles limited bumper to bumper and   years or    miles of   hr roadside assistance   there is a   year with unlimited mileage for corrosion perforation b my final thoughts   i was really disappointed in this truck   if you want a truck then check out the f    it rides and handles a lot better and you can haul more   if you need an suv get the explorer   at least you can haul people more comfortably   i had this truck for two days playing with it   i had the   x   version with the automatic transmission   they also make a   wheel drive version   i did not use it off road since it was brand new and not mine makes some good trucks   i was just not impressed with the   explorer sport trac wd  
461,0,   note read this part of the review first then read the update   my opinion of this vehicle changed considerably over the year and a half we owned it   thanks when my husband and i were starting our search for a new vehicle   we had several issues we needed to address   first and foremost   we wanted a   door vehicle   second   we needed something with a decent cargo area because of my husband s sales job   everything was steering us towards a mini van until we spotted a sport trac it was love at first sight we test drove one at a local dealership and got all the specifics on it   originally we were going to order one   but held off and our patience paid off when we came across a dealer demo that had all of the options we wanted   and a few we could have cared less about   we purchased the sport trac at the beginning of july and already we have over   miles on it the model we purchased is a two wheel drive with the limited slip axle    cyl   cloth interior and the option packages that include the leather steering wheel cover   fog lights   tow bars     wheels   cruise control   and the compass thermometer gauges    i m not going to list the option packages because they keep changing them   ours also came with the cargo cage   something i wouldn t have purchased had it not been included with this one   but have used quite a bit   for those who don t know   this vehicle comes equipped with air conditioning   power door locks and windows and a single cd player radio   at the time we purchased ours   it was only available with an automatic transmission   ours is toreador red and also has the running boards   because we bought a demo   we got a nice chunk of cash knocked off the price   but since it was under a certain mileage amount   it still classified as a new vehicle driving the sport trac is a very pleasant experience   while it doesn t drive like any car i ve driven   it also doesn t drive like a truck either   somewhere in between   handling is very responsive with a minimal roll on corners   even so   it has taken a bit of adjusting for me since i m used to driving honda civics   braking is a bit soft to me   but that also may be due to the difference in the size of the vehicle   the automatic transmission seems to shift easily and has the overdrive option which can be turned off and on with the click of a switch   it rides very smoothly and from what i ve been told   if we switch to passenger tires instead of off road tires when we replace them   that will improve even more   acceleration is very good   passing is a breeze on a flat area and climbing hills isn t an effort the interior is probably my favorite part of the whole vehicle   the two front seats are incredibly comfortable   i suffer from low back problems and these seats have been a god send   the drivers seat has the power adjustments which come in handy since my husband and i don t sit the same way when we drive and we can change it quickly   the rear seat is very roomy   one of my pet peeves with most of the popular suv s is the   knees up the nose   scenario for anyone with long legs sitting in the back   i can easily sit in the back seat   i m     mostly legs   facing forward and not have my knees even touch the seat in front of me   it also has a    split for folding down and makes a very flat surface for carrying things you wouldn t want on the seats or in the bed   there are plenty of cup holders in this particular one as well   two up front and two in the back   guess person number   is out of luck   the cloth interior vacuums easily and i love the fact that you can take the berber type carpet completely out for thorough cleaning with two furry dogs it will come in very handy   there is also this neat little cargo compartment between the seats that is removable if you need to carry something valuable with you interior noise is a little more than i would like but nothing you can t drown out with the stereo   i ve noticed quite a bit of wind noise around the windows   not sure if it s because the windows don t seal as tightly as they should   or an aerodynamic design flaw   one major plus though is the rear sliding window it can be opened several inches with the touch of a button or put down the whole way   even opened just a few inches creates air circulation sufficient to cool it off on a hot day and it keeps the noise to a minimum   far better than driving with the driver or passenger window cracked   i ve never been a big fan of cruise control   but this one is very easy to use and operates very efficiently   all of the other controls are easy to reach too and take a minimum of know how to use with the exception of the windshield wipers   i think there are just a few too many notches in the intermitent section   just how many different speeds do you really need   in addition to the cigarette lighter outlet   they have added an extra one   something which is becoming more of a standard feature now in most cars but for the true sportsman   there is yet another in the bed of the truck for use with various camping sporting equipment   the sound system is very good while ours is only a single cd player   you can get a   cd changer with one of the other option packages   it is a very easy to use cd player radio and the sound quality is excellent for a stock stereo   with two speakers in the front and two speakers in the back   you can enjoy anything from a strauss waltz to metallica without having to change a lot of settings for maximum sound quality   i do wish they had included a cassette with this package for some of us who don t have everything on cd    apparently they have since changed this exterior is actually very simple   not a lot of flash or trim and washes up very easily   while the bed is smaller than most pick ups   it is generally large enough to hold most things an average family needs to haul and with the cargo cage it adds quite a bit of space to it   we used ours to help friends move and got an amazing amount of stuff in the back as well as in the rear seat with it folded down   one big plus with the cargo cage is when it s flipped into the bed   it makes a nice secured space for hauling smaller items so they don t slide all over the bed   my only concern with this bed is that it s made out of this   mysterious composite material i am hoping it holds up with the elements and use okay   on to the things i don t like   the biggest annoyance to me is that has made it impossible to pick and choose what you want in the options department   if you want one thing   you generally end up with two or three other things you don t want and pay an over inflated price for it   a good example of this is if you did want cruise control you can only get it if you purchase the convenience group and also end up with a leather wrapped steering wheel   big deal   auto lock relock   which i hate with a passion   and the remote keyless entry with keypad   a nice feature for the person eternally locking their keys in the car   i guess from an assembly line point of view this is a great idea but for the money conscious consumer   it isn t my other big complaint is the crappy gas mileage   ours averages between   and    depending on where we drive it and how far but apparently this issue is being addressed with suv s in general by the government   so hopefully future suv purchasers will fair better   a tip for any potential buyers thinking of ordering if you are considering the estate green   please go to a dealership and ask to see another vehicle painted in this color   apparently the guy setting up the color charts is color blind   the real shade looks nothing like the brochure or any of the photos i ve seen of it   thank heavens we saw one or we might have been stuck with a truck in a color we didn t like overall we are very pleased with our purchase   i will be very curious to see how it drives a few years from now and if we have any problems with it   before purchasing it we spoke to several regular explorer owners who had nothing but praise for them i m hoping we are as fortunate update     i have changed my rating of the sport trac by lowering it one star and actually considered two   we no longer own this vehicle because of continued problems and poor customer service from not one   but two dealerships as well as itself   in the year and a half we owned it   we had   recalls   had to have the wheel bearings repacked   something i ve never had to have done on any other vehicle i ve ever owned   and then to top it off   had problems with it not wanting to start   i don t enjoy being stranded someplace   so i had it looked in to   only to find that the idle sensor had to be replaced   the last straw for us was when we took it in for a    mile check up   we are in the habit of having the oil changed in our vehicles every      miles and when we took it in when it was right around   miles   they didn t change the oil   what annoyed us even more was that they claimed it didn t need changed   i m sorry   but oil with   miles of driving time is going to show some wear and it s part of the required maintenance at    miles   we got in to it with the dealership who couldn t even understand why we were upset   so we decided to file a complaint with only to have some snippy customer service rep   i use that term loosely   tell us that they hadn t done anything wrong   when we asked her who would pay for a blown engine if it happened because the oil hadn t been changed   she couldn t answer our question   she was rude   and when my husband got a little bit huffy with her   her response to him was   there you go with that attitude again   excuse me   what ever happened to customer service   apparently doesn t know anything about it   needless to say   within two weeks the vehicle was gone   we traded it in on a brand new    honda accord   i will never buy another again and i won t recommend them to my friends   they don t know a thing about craftsmanship or customer service   and for that kind of money i think i should at least get one or the other in this instance i got neither   i don t make a habit of getting rid of vehicles this quickly   but i could see this was one that would be going nowhere   literally as well as figuratively   fast  
462,0,  i will begin by saying that i am not the kind of person who cares what a car looks like   i used to be   when my probe was new   i d wash her   wax her   etc   now i have gotten more concerned with other things    too concerned to worry about how a car looks   it has to be dependable   my car is   it s hit poles   just a tap   deer   walls   just a scrape   and guardrails   scrape again   it s rather small   but it still resists crumpling well   after the last deer hit   in fact   i didn t even get her fixed   still drives fine interior    small   can barely fit four people in the passenger compartment however   the hatchback fits surprisingly large amounts of boxes or furniture exterior    sporty looks   gas mileage    ok    about   mpg highway   only   or so local   though electrical system    has been known as a trouble spot with this car tires    wear fast    hard to keep aligned   that could be the horrid pittsburgh roads   though   lots of potholes summary    i would buy it again   but i would haggle to pay a lot less than     i would not buy it used   however   because i think it s important to know the history of a car like this   if it were a reliable car   like a honda   i say buying used was ok     
463,0,  as a new vehicle this was a grand choice   i have the v   lx model which is by far a more well rounded vehicle than the turbo gt model   i have found the reliability to be greater than the turbo as well   however all cars age   and the probe has done better than most other american cars i ve experienced   but holds no match to a foreign make   normal wear items   like both cv joints have failed   as well as the car now eats   literally   brake pads   some other items have died early on   such as the a c unit has not worked in a while   and looks to cost over    to repair   also the fan switch for the climate control has quit   this should be a normal relay   but everyone i consult as well as my manuals say i need climate control parts because it has a high tech system   however it does not have automatic climate control to my knowledge   the body has held up well   just recently falling victim to surface rust   and that sin a harsh new england climate   it has a leak in the rear   somewhere   according to   that causes some havoc on the electrical system every now and then   to purchase one now would be risky   i would recommend searching long and hard for a perfect model br br  
464,0,  it s funny   as i read the reviews for the windstar it sounded just like my exact thoughts i had when i first bought the van   i loved my   windstar for the safety features   strong engine   low insurance costs   roominess   and ride   then the warranty ended and the problems began   the cruise control worked only when it wanted the upper subframe mount broke   the abs light came on   electrical short   the automatic locking feature would lock every few minutes the one feature that i have come to hate even when working properly   and lastly   and most expensive   the head gasket blew at    miles      has had many problems with the head gasket on the    v    in fact they have extended the warranty on   s to    miles to cover the problem   but i have a   and that doesn t count in fords eyes   calling customer service        is useless   sorry sir your file on this matter is closed i m filing a complaint with the nhtsa and i am writing a letter to for reimbursement   lastly   i would like to break down the overall rating at the end of this review    the first two years of ownership    for the reliability and customer service   dealership and hotline   and for after the warranty period br br  
465,0,  we had a    caravan and test drove the first windstar that came out   we loved the ride and quiet so we bought one   big mistake picked up the car and two weeks later it was in the shop for   days to repair the a c   i turned on the a c and the fan blew all the vents shut   they fixed it but the car was in the shop for   days two months later i turned on the heat and guess what   only defrost worked   they said the vents and passage ways for the heat were defective and needed replaced   another   days in the shop all sent smoothly   except by now we discovered that not one roof top shell type luggage carrier fit a windstar   will sell a    canvas water resistant tent type thing we took out    extended warranty   at    miles the transmission went and the engine gasket went   the re built transmission cost us over    and they said since it was close to the warranty mileage   the dealer would give us a little off the bill   luckily   by now the gasket was a re call    why was i not surprised   i took the car home    poorer and that week end discovered that my brakes failed   when we bought this windstar   advertised that it had more room inside than a grand caravan   after we bought it   i checked out that statement and found it was false i called    to see if they d help with the    bill on the transmission and the man laughed at me   i mean laughed out loud that i thought they d help    quot lady when you re expired   you re expired   even if you were only   miles over   we wouldn t help quot   i was furious i wrote to the ceo of with a copy to consumer s reports   i told him the whole story and asked for help   his assistant called me and she said the exact same thing that the    man said   when you are expired   you re expired   the dealer and ceo assistant said that they used to help people when it was close to the warranty mileage but the stockholders didn t get much money then and they do now   with this new policy i told her that it was interesting what she said and ironic   because we were leaving to go pick up our brand new grand caravan   p s    miles later   our caravan has never been in the shop br br  
466,0,  the windstar has both good points as well as bad   we were sold on how comfortable the car was to drive and ride in   i also have to haul equipment around in it so the room was also a plus   about one year after we had the van   we experienced out first trouble   it was strange   the car would not go in to third gear   staying in nd instead of drive or over drive   we brought it to the dealer for repair and got the surprise   no the car was not pregnant   we needed a whole new transmission on a year old car   in the mechanic s ramblings we learned that he had to do this kind of work a lot on the minivan line   while the comfort of the van was luxurious   the hassle of having to get a major repair so soon after receiving the car was too much of an event to convince me to lease another   the warranty of course covered the repair but i have to assume that this can happen again   the new transmission can from the same people who made the year old one   i return the van in three months and i think i ll get a fuel efficient sports car br br  
467,0,  we bought our   windstar minivan used in may of   with about    miles on it   we immediately noticed little things that were annoyances but felt like we could live with it   cup holders which immediately broke   rear on vent window no longer working   chair arms breaking   the ride and glide of this van was great   even though the gas mileage was not at all what we had hoped for   i wanted this van because i wanted to keep my children safe   it replaced a   taurus station wagon which had had numerous problems   all of which we attributed to just having a bad year   all was well until right at    miles the head gasket blew   because we were not under warranty   we took it to a local reputable repair shop and paid     for the repair   in less than two weeks i am driving down a very busy highway and my engine self destructs   now we have to have a whole new engine   the     for the head gasket repair is down the tubes   and we have to shell out    of the cost for the   new   engine which is   in fact   a remanufactured engine   and on top of that   they have no idea how long it will take to get it in because there is such a high demand for these engines right now because there are so many people having the same problem as i have had   i am thankful that is only going to charge us    of the cost   and i am thankful that they are giving us a    mile powertrain warranty which will be backdated to the time that we actually bought the van   however   after this has happened and we have read countless reviews of this happening to others   not to mention the transmission troubles and timing gasket troubles we apparently have to look forward to   i go back to my original intent in buying this van   to keep my children safe   this is not the van that i thought i was buying never again     never again updated information   yes   within two weeks of getting the van back with the   new   engine   the transmission falls out   that sucker is gone   we now own a   toyota sienna and are very thankful for it   never again     no wonder y all are having such troubles  
468,0,  i will never buy a windstar again   mine has been in the shop nine times for transmission work or front end work   as for the transmission   it shifts hard going into second gear   told me this is normal on the windstar   every time i took the van in   they would do minor adjustments and give it back to me with the van still shifting hard   a month after the warranty went out the transmission went out completely   it took me threatening to take them to court before they finally fixed the transmission   i have four friends who have bought windstars and three of them are having the same problem with their transmission   i am also having problems with the front end   i have been talking to a man that works on vehicles and he has informed me that the windstar has three problems   one   transmissions   two   front end alignment problems   three gasgets on the engine   two of the three i have had problems with   has earned its reputation   fix or repair daily br br  
469,0,  i loved driving this van   i would probably still be driving it if was a responsible and reputable   at    miles my van started showing the classic symptoms of pending head gasket failure   my dealer service manager discovered the problem but could offer me no financial assistance even though he agreed the failure was premature and identical to the problem on various        model vehicles for which had issued extended    coverage warranties   i spoke with the district office as well as the main customer service office in detroit to no avail   d only answer was that if i could show where assistance had been provided to other owners of    or later vehicles in a similar circumstance   they would try to offer assistance   i got rid of the vehicle before the failure occurred   avoid any vehicle with a    liter engine   also   has a continuing problem with faulty defective transmissions   of my friends and family members who drive drove vehicles with    liter engines   the following can sum up the experience co worker on his th engine and nd transmission   in law on her nd engine and rd transmission   cousin on nd engine    also had    damage repair from defective subframe failure  
470,0,  we have had so many problems with this van it isn t funny   the head gasket blew and was fixed before we got it thank goodness but who cares really with all the other problems we have had   what difference would one more problem make   on top of a ton of other problems   we had a check engine light coming on that was a cylinder   misfire code   we took it in had the spark plugs   wires   complete tune up and it didn t fix the problem   i took it to and they said that it was a head gasket problem   i decided to get a second opinion because we were not having any other symptoms of head gasket problems and the guy i took it to said that we didn t have the problem like had told me and suggested a few other things   we first tried the coil pack and it didn t fix it   so we replaced the computer and it corrected the problem completly   i drove it about   miles and the oil light started coming on   flickering on and off   i stopped immediatly and checked the oil and it was not low   i went straight to the mechanic and he said that he thought the oil pan screen might be clogged    another    repair   and suggested i change the oil to a heavier weight to see if it could help first   the oil light went off and was fine for about   minutes and then the check engine light came on with a cylinder   misfire code   i drove it home and parked it for the night   the next day i was going to drive it back up and leave it with the mechanic and when i turned the key i heard a huge clunking scraping sort of sound and then nothing   the dumb thing wouldn t start   so i had it towed to the mechanic and he said that he suspected a seized engine but will let me know tomarrow   it never seems to run out of things to go wrong   i would definatly not recommend a windstar unless you just like spending time and money at your mechanic for endless repairs    updated to say   that the engine is locked   i am hardly suprised   i took it as a bad sign when we were looking to sell our van and    of them had either a new or rebuilt engine on it

472,0,  alright   so you re interested in buying a sport utility vehicle   time to look around   the explorer    a great car   size is not too big and not too small   huge trunk size   design is flawless   especially the   model   now   four door or two door   the difference in price is certainly one factor   but   let us look at the other factors my qualms about the two door the back seat passangers have very little room it s really no bigger than a regular car and gets ten times worse gas millege basically   two door cars are just a big pain to deal with   from my standpoint pay the extra cash for the four door   it s easier   nicer and just   overall   more convenient it makes driving enjoyable when everyone riding in the car is comfortable and happy if you are shopping around for sport utilities   also consider the toyota runner   my personal pick   the niessan pathfinder and   for a smaller variety   the honda crv   which   in actuality   is not small by any means    i test drove one a few months ago and was extremely impressed with not only the size   but also all of the special features that come even on some of the most stripped down models happy shopping and drive safely br br  
473,0,  okay   perhaps this title is a tad misleading   actually i ended my ownership of my paid for   escort   after about a year   this is a good car for some people   but read further to ascertain if in fact it is right for you   or someone you care about b why did i purchase a escort   my previous vehicle had seen its last days   i meandered over to the local dealership   while i wanted a car i could depend on   i was also seeking safety and reliability   and wanted a vehicle which was also appealing to the eye   i thought the   escort   was really cute   and it was reasonably priced   around     at that time   it is probably around     at this time   i purchased the   escort lx dr   which is the luxury model of the   escorts     the purchasing experience   the sales personnel were pretty nice and were helpful   i decided to pay cash for this car   and obtained a three year    mile warranty   however   we were not pleased when the salespeople and sales manager made us sit there waiting   playing games   for hours   they did not make points    some of the comparable models in the escort line    dr hatchback gt   dr hatchback lx   dr hatchback lx   dr hatchback lx   dr sedan lx   dr wagon the   escort   is a   cylinder of course with a    liter engine   the car seats    though of adults wouldn t be comfortable in the back seat   my   escort   was turquoise in color   had a c   air bags   am fm stereo   hatchback   cassette    here are the features and availability from the website   anti lock brakes   not available driver and passenger side airbags are standard air conditioning is optional alloy wheels optional cassette optional cruise control is optional there is not a full size spare leather seats not available luggage rack not available power brakes are standard on this vehicle power door locks are optional power seats not available power steering is optional power windows are optional premium stereo not available rear defogger is optional sun and moon roof is optional tilt steering is optional   here are some of the dimensions for the car noted on the website   cargo capacity   cu front head room   rear head room   front leg room   rear leg room   exterior length   width   height   curb weight   wheelbase   fuel tank capacity    gallon the mileage for this car is excellent at    b what i enjoyed about the car   other than the airbags for short or small people   see below   the car is very safe   this car had absolutely no repairs required in the period of time i owned it   i really appreciated the reliability and dependability   all around driving was fine   the vehicle turned corners well   and i liked the compactness of the car   and the ease in parking because of the small size   it is relatively inexpensive to maintain   i always have to have a cupholder   and this had one in the center console   as well as a change bin   the ignition is illuminated which is a nice feature b what i don t like    what i didn t enjoy about the   escort   is it has almost no   get up and go   it is powerless   it is not fun to drive   it is not comfortable even in the driver s seat   i have a back problem   and if i drove for more than a half an hour or so i was miserable   the seats are simply not comfortable   as they are very hard   the auto transmission is slow   the driver s side air bag in the   model that i owned was one of the first air bags that came out   this meant that in a slow speed crash it would deploy and anyone   child or short adult   under     or so   could die   this made me nervous whenever i drove the car   because i am     if i am going to die in a car crash i would like it to be for a valid reason   like a high speed crash   not because of a poorly thought out   dangerous air bag   the dashboard appeared to be made of plastic   it was poorly constructed   and frankly looked cheap    so   what happened with this car b even though this car was completely paid for i couldn t wait to get rid of it   due to safety concerns not overall   but due to the airbag problem for small or short people   me   comfort concerns   enjoyment in driving   etc   if you are not short like me   and want an inexpensive   simple   basic economy car i would think the car is acceptable i now have a saturn sc   the sporty model   and love it   i feel safer in it   it looks sharp   it is fun to drive   has all the bells and whistles   dings can usually be rubbed out   so the insurance is less expensive b final wrap up   this is a safe reliable vehicle for most people   if you are short or small or have passengers who are   you may want to really give this some thought   as noted   these airbags were the first out there   so could cause serious injury or death if they were deployed during a slow speed crash   i read this in a few website locations   the motorized seatbelts are a hassle   and the car is very noisy to drive   the seats are hard and terrible for someone with back problems   i did not enjoy this car   other than the cuteness factor   but it is reasonably priced   inexpensive to maintain   minimal repair problems   obviously others love this car   but for me   i give it a two stars   well okay   two and a half stars   if you decide to purchase this vehicle   be sure to check out the airbag situation   as it could mean the life of you   your child or a small person riding in the vehicle thanks for reading suzi
474,0,  real life comments on usability on our   escort wagon we sold our toyota pu   for a family car   because we were expecting a child   and needed to be able to have a child car seat in it   we also are a one car family   going from the pick up   which had good mileage and hauling capacity   we wanted a station wagon we picked the escort over the subaru for a few reasons   but mostly cost and fuel economy   the subaru has become a   quot sport utility quot   and the cost has shot up   while the fuel economy went down we have not been disappointed   the escort gets good mileage   mid   s in the city   and    mpg on the highway   with a stick   it s zippy and responsive   we feel safe in it ours we picked up used   k for     in    when it was almost   years old   we bought from an owner directly   but as i looked in used car lots   i saw alot of similar cars   in the       range   and didn t have as nice packages   automatic   no ac   etc   so i think we got a good deal   plus   all we ve had to do to it is regular maintenance b good things about it    are some of the features like the stock radio is nice   having a tach   and nice dashboard layout   it s got several dome lights and has power rear view mirrors   that make it easy for adjusting   it s also got a tiny   insignificant feature i like   a little arrow by the fuel gage that tells you what side of the car the fule lid is on   the front seats work nice   and the back has a split   rd   rd seat   for loading b bad things about it    are that the car is a bit small   i m    quot    pounds   sometimes i bonk my head   but i don t feel   quot cramped quot   once settled in   and while the car seat for the kiddo works   my back does get a big tweaked from time to time   and she s had her head bonked a few times as well   i m not sure this car would work as the only car for a family with two teenagers   right now   and until the kids are     i think it would be fine the other downer   is that the car sometimes sounds a bit   quot tinny quot   this is kind of unfounded   but my worry   it that it won t hold up over time   i mean   will i be able to put    miles on this car   or will things start to break   a few insignificant things are starting to show wear at    miles   my concern is how the car will age   will i see lots of this in the next     miles i ll keep you posted b andr b br br  
475,0,  remember back in the   s when grocery stores came out the generic canned goods   they were quite popular and then were made fun of   i remember seeing an automobile painted in the familiar blue and white generic color with the word car painted on the side the    escort wagon lx strikes me as that kind of car   in fact   the entire escort line strikes me that way it s a car   nothing fancy   certainly nothing very desirable   but it has four wheels and will get you from here to there it has been a fairly dependable car   although squeaks and rattles showed up almost immediately   for the first year i had that car in the shop quite often trying to nail down noises that i felt shouldn t have been there still   it has performed reasonably well   if not exceptionally   it has little pick up   it is not particularly roomy   the ride is rougher than i like   road noise is pretty loud   but it gets you from here to there   if you are someone who doesn t particularly care what kind of car you drive    just need transportation or don t have a lot of money    than this isn t such a bad car to own   but if you re looking for anything with pick up   style   room   or comfort   and quiet then the escort is not for you br br  
476,0,   fine   i ll just go buy something bigger and nicer   that s what i told the toyota salesman a year and a half ago when we couldn t strike even close to the deal we wanted on a sienna minivan   we had a windstar that was nothing but problems so i was hesitant to buy anymore products   however   with a bad experience at a bad toyota dealership   we went back to the local lot to look    i don t think all toyota dealerships are bad   you can see my review on my new   toyota sienna   the salesman recommended that we look at suvs as opposed to minivans since they tend to hold far better value than minivans   majestically sitting on the front row was a good looking   expedition eddie bauer edition   i ll have to admit these vehicles are eye catchers   as we soon found out   with eye catchers   reality sometimes gets tossed out the window   we struck a lease deal and soon headed out on a long road trip that very evening   that s when i soon realized what i had done                problem     gas mileage   on the highway with cruise control on   and no major hills   you can get a whopping   mpg   keep in mind   i m a republican   but even those kinds of gas mileage upset me and my pocketbook     problem     control   the vehicle handles very awkwardly in curves and in situations requiring quick response   i often found myself trying to overcompensate for bad timing in curves   problem     cabin design   folks   this is one of the biggest vehicles on the road   therefore   there must be plenty of leg room and cargo space right   wrong   the third row seat is made for munchkins   seriously   very minimal leg room back there   so then you say    oh   that must be to make up for the cargo room behind the third seat   right   wrong again   we have to sit our folded stroller vertically to make it fit   and then you sort of have to   slam   the door to get the stroller to push against the back seat so the door will close   big disappointment   problem     you get to know your service department personnel by name   we owned the vehicle for approximately   months and had approximately    in repairs over   separate incidents   good thing i purchased an extended warranty     problem     depreciation   we leased the vehicle based on a     base price   when we went to trade it in   months later the best trade in we got was      and that was a high offer from the dealership we bought it from because they knew the vehicle and had serviced it   many times   i m really glad i didn t pay the new sticker price of     plus just so you don t think i m solely a complainer   i will share with you some of the good things     beautiful exterior with nice paint   definitely one of the best looking vehicles on the road      l v triton engine has lots of power and can handle any load you put on it   definitely would be great to pull campers with     leather seats are tough and durable even with small kids       probably the best factory sound system i ve ever heard   beats most aftermarket stuff     climate control and rear air make the cabin comfortable for all passengers to sum it up   i was more disappointed with this     vehicle than i was pleased   i m very glad to be the owner of a new   toyota sienna   our family rides much more comfortably now   if you still decide you want one of these monsters   i highly recommend an extended warranty   good luck on your new purchase  
477,0,  we bought a   expedition   we had previously had a   jeep cherrokee and it turned out to be quite the lemon   i did my research and used autobytel to purchase the car   i do think that by using this service we saved several thousand dollars   after looking at all the different expeditions and driving the x   we decided on the eddie bauer edition   the x was a very bumpy ride and it sits so high i could barely get into the truck   we have loved the size   we did get the third seat and it works well for children   but the truck is extremely bumpy compared to our old jeep and other suv s   there is also a recall coming up about the windshield wipers   they go off all the time   i do not think we will get another expedition when out lease is up br br  
478,0,  i recently got an oppertunity to drive an expedition in dallas tx i will admit it does have a good look but it s made by   i will also admit i have been a chevy man since i was a kid   the expedition does have room though the seats were not really comfortable    and it does have plenty of cup holder s   this truck is good for that mom or school teacher who like s to run a rat pack of kid s to their soccer or basketball game   it s loaded with options decent stereo with cd changer   when i got the expedition on the freeway   i was not impressed with the acceleration   it seemed to take off as if though it was a six cylinder   now from my understanding these thing s come with a v which i believe is a    litre engine   compared to chevy s    litre i know there is no contest here   i also noticed they have beenm recalled for tires falling off brake mastercyliders failing   and sorry gas milage   i wouldn t own one even if they gave it to me remeber the four dangeruos word s kids   stands for   fixed or repaired daily   so if you have been brainwashed from child birth to purchase product s flame on    if you are smart and do enough research    you will see how often they see a shop   also note friends don t let friend s drive s see also consmer reports recalls   don t say i didn t warn you     
479,0,  i have expressed my dislike of suvs in many of my earlier reviews   but as long as my relatives continue to buy them   i will continue to write of my displeasure when driving them   s expedition is now sadly a   quot mid size quot   suv despite the fact that it in itsself is a monstrosity   the car   with its massive size offers an unwanted guarantee that it will kill the passengers of any car you come into collision with   my closest friend s husband died in a collision with an explorer   a smaller car   and the child driving the explorer is still emotionally wounded   however   it still is ridiculously flimsy   and suffered    of damage once in a five mph collision with a garage door   of course my biggest pet peeve is mpg   this car gets a ridiculously low mpg of nearly   in the city   i think it would be more environmentally sound to clear cut ten acres of rain forest then drive an expedition around for ten years   as usual   i have experienced another suv and grown to hate it   i recommend buying any car that will not waste fuel and kill passengers of other cars you may collide with br br  
480,0,  my mother has one of these monstrocities   and i drove it for the first time a few weeks ago   it was the most nerve racking experience of my life   going from my small toyota camry to the expedition reminded me of the mock suv   the canyonero   from tv s the simpsons   you remember the theme song    quot fifty yards long and two lanes wide it s fifty tons of american pride quot   i love all the features on it   led showing   quot miles to empty quot   or   quot miles per gallon quot   six disc cd player   auto climate control   blinkers in the side mirrors   and room for seven comfortably   it was definately powerful   and the power steering was very responsive   but i couldn t stop worrying about hitting the car next to me or the curb   in short   if you are a very experienced driver and want luxury in an suv   buy this vehicle   if you re even the slightest bit nervous about driving   get something smaller br br  
481,0,  i used to drive a   full size bronco eddie bauer   i then took some vacation time in colorado and decided to rent the expedition   compared to the bronco   i hated the expedition   it s a larger truck but inside it doesn t feel like it at all   the parking brake constantly dug into my shin   it didn t handle nearly as well as the bronco did   but that s not surprising being that it is a larger vehicle   i even wound up sleeping in the vehicle one night and found it quite frustrating that    the seats don t recline enough to sleep in very well and    with the design of the rear seats   there is no comfertable way to sleep in the back   it s also too luxurious   i can t stand what car companies are doing to these trucks   if you want luxury   buy a bmw   if you want a truck   don t expect it to look and feel like car   although i must say   my   bronco was able to outhandle my friends   vw golf on dry roads which i proved when i wound up pulling him out of the ditch   br br  
482,0,  after many years of driving a   door minivan   with three kids my husband and i decided go for something more practical   we both like the look of the expedition and the fact that it has the third seat   we got to the dealership and we gung ho and ready to buy   i took it for a spin while my husband conversed with the salesman   upon my return and to the dismay of the salesman i told my husband no way   after he drove the expedition he also agreed   we were reluctant to reject this vehicle because until you drive it    its great   the interior is well designed and comfortable but the positive aspects of the vehicle are mostly aesthetic   the truck feels narrow and   quot pigeon toed quot   while driving   rendering it a poor handling truck   the suspension feels too bouncy making the truck feel as though it were all over the road so to speak   especially over bumps   i drove the truck for about   minutes   and my husband the same   so in total we drove for an hour and a half and were unfortunately not at all impressed br br  
483,0,  i was not in the market for a new vehicle   but my son was   he asked that i go with to look at the expedition   it didn t take long for him to realize he could not afford it   however   while looking with him   i fell in love with the expedition eddie bauer edition   of course and   behind my son s back   went and purchased one   sitting behind the wheel of this humongous vehicle makes me feel like the queen of the road   the smell of the leather   all the modern conveniences   the sense of power one gets from controlling this huge animal and all the envious glares from on lookers makes one feel on top of the world   however   i soon learned that the cost of the vehicle   as high as it is   would only be a fraction of what it would cost to drive and maintain this animal   unless you have money to burn   and a smaller vehicle for your everyday running around   i do not recommend this vehicle   after putting only    miles on mine   i was fortunate to sell it just as gas prices began to soar   i am now happily in a    mpg small car br br  
484,0,    update      i am downgrading this car to   stars    and will not recommend this car any longer   i have learned that there are four simultaneous government safety probes launched on this model   regarding such items as unintended airbag inflation   engine fires   and bad rear wheel bearings   there have also been eight recalls for the focus   which i reflected in the reliability rating   i am also concerned with other of europe products   such as the bigger   contour   and even the   jaguar x type    which were designed by the same folks and share much of the engineering and some parts   my contour review has been downgraded accordingly i b below is the original review from      which i chose not to alter in any way despite the disturbing information above b i don t know why   but my contour seems to have a huge affinity for body shops   as soon as i brought it to tucson from the harsh life of the san francisco bay area   the car acquired another huge dent in the front fender    using the few drops of bay area gasoline left in its tank   it had been towed here   not driven   that meant i had to arrange yet another rental car for the duration of the repairs   of course after yelling out a few choice words on this final bay area curse   i was happy to pick up a brand new cloud nine white   focus lx   door sedan   with a whopping   miles on the odometer   although it differed significantly from the spunky zx hatchback most of the other reviewers wrote about   i still found the car to be very pleasant b the exterior   the exterior of the focus has often been described as   love it or hate it   styling   it is very true    and for the most part   i love it   the very geometric shapes of the wheel well arches   the sharp and triangular headlights   and the fixed antenna mounted over the center of the car all served to give this car a personality   the focus   developed in europe just like my contour   definitely looked the part   features like the center mounted radio antenna are very common in small european cars   and on the streets of tucson where jellybean shaped korean cars dominate   this car was a standout   even the wheel covers on the standard    stock wheels looked decent   i must   however   say that the focus sedan looks rather boring next to the sporty hatchback version b the interior    dashboard   the interior continued the exterior styling   with a dashboard full of asymmetric shapes and bold diagonal lines   interrupted by perfectly oval vents   conventional would be the last thing to describe this dashboard   but i liked it   although the dashboard was made entirely of hard plastic   it did not feel or look cheap   the instrument cluster was more conventional   and it was extremely easy to read   its legible letters   bright warning lights   and green backlighting bore a family resemblance to the boring yet legible instrument cluster in my contour   sadly   there was no tachometer in this bare bones lx   in the middle of the dashboard was a large emergency flasher switch   large and illuminated just like those on volkswagens   below it   a large   easy to use radio cassette player welcomed me   and even at low volume settings i could hear it clearly   although i felt quite some distortion at higher volumes   below the radio was the climate control system   with separate a c and recirculation buttons and many options for airflow adjustment    just like the excellent systems in japanese cars and volkswagens   and a far improvement over the old fashioned controls of my contour   and yes   the a c was very cold b the interior    seating   it took me a bit to get used to the driving position   but the seat was decent   the driver s seat adjusted for fore aft   seatback tilt   and seat height   i found that the seat somehow became more uncomfortable as i raised it   the seat did not hug me as well as my car s seat   but it supported me in the right places   from the seat it was easy to operate the controls   the steering wheel   while not as nice as the one in my contour   was still good   with thickened grab points at   and   positions   and the turn signal and windshield wiper stalks were within easy reach   next to the parking brake lever   i could even find a pen holder   i also tried the rear seat   and found plenty of headroom there   but legroom seemed a bit more cramped than my contour   the seatback had a    split fold down feature   which was easy to use from the trunk   the trunk   with its high lid   was fairly spacious   but not deep   and thoughtfully it came with a fluorescent pull handle which trapped children and adults could use to escape    i trapped myself in the trunk just to test it out   and it was very easy to use   even better for children   this car came with three child seat anchors above the rear seat    but on the other hand   the child lock switches are hidden deep inside the rear doors   and requires the key to flip b performance   as the repairs to my contour only took three days   i did not have too much of a time to check this focus out on the road   tucson s dead straight streets also offered little opportunity to test out the handling of the vehicle   nevertheless   i drove around quite a bit   heading out of town to nearby mountain passes to watch the beautiful desert sunsets    and to test this car s cornering abilities   although the steering did not feel as direct as my car s   it was still fairly sharp and responsive   and i could take mountain curves at    mph above recommended speeds without feeling the car lean into the corners   too often i would find myself stuck behind a less nimble car   such as kia sephia   struggling just to maintain the recommended curve speed   on the other hand   i was not as happy with the powertrain   while the    liter spi engine carried over from the escort was adequate   the   speed automatic transmission was quite slushy and hesitant   by contrast   the zx hatchback   reviewed by others here   inherited the more sophisticated contour powertrain   including the more powerful zetec engine   in the future i should drive a zx for comparison   while driving   i found the visibility to be so so   the view to the rear felt somewhat limited   and the outside mirrors were smallish   at least the manual mirrors were very easy to adjust precisely   in other cars   manual mirrors tend to be too sensitive and finicky to adjust precisely   at night   headlights were fairly bright   both high and low b workmanship quality   it appeared that the car was very well put together   the paint seemed smooth   the interior materials seemed substantial   and i could not find a single rattle    but then   this was a brand new car   so it had better be quiet   aside from a slightly damaged roofliner fastener   i saw no defects   i could hear some engine noise during acceleration   but otherwise the car was fairly quiet   even the turn signal clicks were soft and synthesized    soothing enough to inspire a few poems   it seems that strove to put the quality feel of a sophisticated european car into an inexpensive american built car   and it succeeded   on the other hand   this car also felt quite flimsy in many aspects   the way the hood and the doors closed and the way the car drove told me that despite what the marketers may claim   the focus is not a replacement for the contour   yes   this is a fantastic car   a superb replacement for the escort and a formidable competitor to the likes of honda civic and toyota corolla    but this is still a smaller car   not in the league of bigger   heftier cars like vw jetta   vw golf   and s own contour   yes   the focus has more headroom than the contour   but that is only because the contour got saddled with a ridiculously low roofline b pricing   as i put away my rental contract in the glovebox   i found the car s sticker   the sticker revealed that this vehicle was a stripped down base model   equipped with only automatic transmission and a c as options   the base price was in the ballpark of      and the particular vehicle i rented   after destination charge   was     msrp   i think this is a bit too expensive   but then   crammed lots of extras into this car as standard equipment   including a high quality cassette player   an electric   not cable   trunk release   fold down rear seats   power steering   and a large    liter engine to start with   true   i could find a car for less   but they would lack some of these features many people now take for granted   besides   once i drop the    automatic transmission   even a loaded zx hatchback with cruise control and power accessories could be had for the price of this lowly lx   and the top line zts sedan would still be under      i won t complain with this kind of pricing   and since the likes of carsdirect sell the focus at near invoice prices   the pricing will be even sweeter than these msrp figures suggest b verdict   contrary to s marketers   the focus does not replace the contour   but it is an outstanding replacement for the escort   although i was saddled with the rock bottom lx with lackluster powertrain   i still was able to enjoy the car s thoughtful features   european personality   and precise handling   i had driven a top line focus zts last year on a closed track and was impressed then   and this base model did not disappoint me either unfortunately   this car comes from a that is mega obsessed with trucks   not cars   visiting the dealership where my car was repaired    and this rental was picked up    i could see hundreds of trucks and suv s versus only two dozen passenger cars   kept cheapening the contour before killing it outright   and i am not sure how serious is about this car either   i ve grown a strong dislike for because of its role in creating and perpetuating the current suv boom   and that will keep me away from the focus   unfortunately   at this price level   the only viable competitor seems to be hyundai elantra   another fantastic car from another i hate   of course   there is the option of buying japanese or volkswagen    but for a price  
485,0,  after researching different types of small to mid sized cars earlier this year   i decided that the focus was definitely the type of car i wanted for myself   it was only a little bigger than my old car   a   omni   it had a ton of fun new features   and it seemed pretty reliable from the information i could find on the internet about it   so   after applying for a new car loan from my bank   and finding the focus i wanted from carmax s website   i went in and bought myself a new car p p i was excited   i had all these new features   and a bigger engine to play with   my car came stocked with power windows   power door locks   am fm radio   a cd player   and the new ztech engine we had heard about   i was very proud of this shiny new car   showed it off to everyone where i worked   took my friends and family on test drives to show how great this car was   and recommended focuses and carmax to everyone p p and then   the first problem hit   almost a week after we bought the car   on the way home from work   the check engine light came on   when i pulled into carmax   i was brushed off by the service department there   and told that they wouldn t be the ones fixing the problem   it was still under s    mile warranty   i was surprised to hear that   as when i bought the car   i bought it with carmax s maxcare warrantly as i ve had my other cars in for service there   and have been very pleased with the level of service   i was unaware that there was any warranty under   i didn t even know american car companies offered them   but figured the people at carmax knew what they were doing   and had them call up our local dealer in leesburg   va   the next day when i picked up the car from jerry s leesburg   i was told that a sensor had blown   that they replaced it and everything should be fine   they were right for about three months that is      our first sign of trouble occurred on september     when i was driving my husband back from his eye doctor appointment in reston   va   we were driving home   and the transmission seemed to slip   having driven an old car for most of my life   i just thought it was a normal thing and brushed it off   but that weekend it got worse   after going to our local mall on saturday   september th   the car decided to throw us for another loop   as we were driving down the road   the transmission started slipping again   more violently this time   and the interior and exterior lights started to flicker on and off   we got the car home as soon as we could   given the traffic around our area   and the next day took it out for a test drive   since carmax    the dealer would not be open again until monday morning   to see if we could pin down what was causing the problem   we drove it for about   minutes   so that the car would be warmed up   and then as we were driving by worldcom in ashburn   the problem started again   we hadn t done anything to cause a problem   but slam on the brakes when a bird flew out in front of the car      the next morning   this would be monday   september th   we took the car to carmax again as they still had not sufficiently explained this unknown warranty to us   again   we were told to go to the dealer as carmax wouldn t touch it   so   i called into work telling them i would be late   and we went over to the koons in sterling   va to drop the car off   i got a call from them later that afternoon telling me that the service technicians were unable to find any problems with the car and could we please come in for a test drive the following morning   so   my husband and i got up extra early that tuesday   this would be september th   and went on a rather lengthy test drive with the technician   and still the problem did not occur again   at this point   the technicians were being extremely helpful   and said that if we didn t mind having extra miles put on the car   the technician would drive it to and from his home in front royal that evening to see if it occurred during his drive   the next morning   still nothing was found   and we were forced to pick up the car that afternoon with no resolution p p   surprisingly though   the car behaved alright for the next couple of days   and didn t exhibit any more signs of failing until saturday   september st when the car started doing the same things it had done to us on saturday   september th   except that it was also making the gages on the dash go up and down making it look like we were doing   mph at a stop light   luckily for us   the koons service department was still open that saturday afternoon   so we drove the car in as it was breaking down so they could visibly see what it was doing   the service department at koons took the car in right away   and about a half hour later   we were told that the car s alternator was dead   so   we waited until about    p m   as we were promised they would have the car all fixed up by the close of business that afternoon   and went to go visit matt in the service department   he told us that the car wasn t finished yet   and offered to give us a loaner so we would have transportation until we could pick the car up on monday p p   we picked up the car monday morning   and it drove wonderfully until friday   september th   i was driving with my husband to our local enterprise car rental agency   so we could pick up a rental car for that weekend for a family get together   when the check engine light came on in the car again   clearly upset   i drove the car back to koons that morning and demanded they fix the car this time   they took the car in   and later i was told that another sensor in the engine had blown   but it was fixed   i picked up the car on september th   and again the car seemed fine for awhile   and then it started doing the same thing it had been doing back when this whole thing started      on friday   october th   on the way home from my husband s oral surgery   the car s transmission started slipping   the interior and exterior lights blinked on and off   and all the gages on the dash shot up and then went back down to normal   since my husband was still somewhat sedated   i decided to wait until the next morning to take the car to koons   that saturday   i took the car in and told them to call me when they had it fixed   about    p m   on saturday   october th   we received a call from the dealer telling us that what was wrong was a loose ground wire and they fixed it and the car was ready for pick up   it sounded plausible   so we piled into one of our friend s cars   as my husband could still not drive yet   and picked up the car p p   again   the car drove ok for awhile   i ran into a little difficulty on wednesday   october th on my way to the national zoo from work while i was sitting in traffic on the beltway   but i thought it was just my imagination   and tried to convince myself that the car could not be breaking down again after all of that   well   there s only so much you can brush off because on saturday   november th   the car started exhibiting the same exact signs as before   and as before   we drove it straight back to koons in sterling to be fixed   i just got a message on my voicemail at work this morning that they can t find anything wrong with the car   but they will check again today   and see if anything shows up      so   my shiny new car that i was so proud of back in may has turned into my worst nightmare   this is unfortunately not the first time i ve had this kind of trouble   i had a   intrepid that cost us a lot of money in repairs   but this focus only has    miles on it   i can t even imagine what horrors await me when it hits        i would only recommend the   focus zx to someone who doesn t plan on driving it much or who wants to learn how to fix some of these newer cars   this car has proven to be very unreliable for people who need a reliable car to drive to and from work and take care of their family   the car looks great   and when it works   it drives like a dream   but who buys a car to have it in the shop all the time  
486,0,  you may have read my initial review of the   focus zx where i lauded the car s impressive features for the price   impressive handling   styling and comfort   to say i am   dissappointed   six months and    miles into my ownership experience   is a gross understatement this vehicle has spent   days in the shop because of a variety of fuel system and transmission problems    spd manual   the dealership initially insisted that there was nothing wrong with the transmission and that they could not duplicate my complaint   after doing exhaustive internet research   i found that the transmission problem affects almost every focus with the   speed manual   i also found that although initially denied there was any such problem   the has recently issued a service bulletin regarding   gear rollover noise gear rollover causes a distinct chattering from the transmission   the car sounds like an old diesel engine   there is no doubt that the noise will substantially impair the trade or resale value of this car and it suggests that a more serious transmission problem is yet to come   says the noise is   normal   gas consumption is much less than claims under all driving conditions the engine loses rpm and stumbles   as if it s going to stall   at almost every traffic light   my dealer has been unable to fix the stumble there is a noise coming form the cargo area which sounds like a mechanic left a wrench or something inside the body i am filing for the lemon law hearing this week   i highly suggest you run a word search in the usenet archives and check out the problems people are reporting with their focus  
487,0,  in all fairness to and people who rated the focus highly   i rated mine on a rental car   it was a basic model   with automatic trans   but plain interior   perhaps the one i rented wasn t typical of all models   also   i tend to base my opinion about cars on my   toyota camry   and this is probably unfair to american car manufacturers   read that anyway you want b some positives about the car b i liked the size of the car    very compact b   but with ample room for up to four people   the front seats had plenty of headroom due to the high profile of the car the   trunk was exceptionally large   for a car this size the car   turned around in literally no space at all b   it has a very tight turning radius gas mileage appeared to be very good   but i didn t actually keep track b the things i didn t like b first of all   who in gets paid to style these things   maybe it s just not my cup of tea   but i think   the style   to quote my   year old   sucks b the car was quiet enough in the city   but on the road   getouttahere   new york construction sites are quieter   i heard that   droning road noise b   especially from the rear   long enough to put me in a straight jacket the dash board looks like had stock in a plastics   maybe the bulk was supposed to impress me    but it looked downright ugly b   the high rear deck caused me problems when looking in the rear view mirror b road handling on the highway didn t impress me b   it had minimal pickup and i didn t care for the road feel   i kept the car at around   mph   and it seemed to be straining to go faster   the focus seemed to wander too much and not give me a firm steering feel i didn t find the dash buttons   door locks   radio controls   etc   to be exceptional   in fact   the radio seemed to have two volume positions   off and loud   there was no in between   and with today s rock that i had to listen to for hours   well   i think you know my feelings b bottom line b   the car simply didn t math up to my   toyota camry in any category   in fact   if i were making a choice in buying a low price car   i would look to a   camry or honda for a much better value  
488,0,  this car is a lemon   plain and simple my wife and i bought the car in april    to replace an escort that had just ended it s lease   and we had no trouble with brake problems within the car s first week   the brakes were grinding   we took it in to the dealer   where we were told   that s normal   focuses do that within    miles   the front and rear brakes needed to be replaced   originally the dealer tried to charge us for the repair   but after arguing for about an hour and having to explain to them why the rear brakes should never have to be replaced after    miles   they finally did the work as warranty    miles   we had the same problem   again   the dealer tried to charge us to fix the brakes   and again we refused   the dealer went so far as to suggest that the problem is that my wife drives the car most of the time   and since she s a female she was probably   feathering   the brake pedal causing them to wear out quickly    miles   we had to replace front and rear brakes again   this time   at a different dealer   they put on heavy duty brake pads and rotors that have lasted so far     miles on the car now   they tried charging us for the work   but i went in with a stack of about   pages of printouts from fordfocusbrakeproblems and the nhtsa website of customer complaints exactly like ours   they finally comped the service poor mileage bills this car as an economy car   we ve never gotten over mpg average on a tank of gas   we took it back to after having the car for about a month   and they told us that is normal   we asked why the window sticker said it would get over mpg   but was getting under   at the time   they said the sticker is just an estimate   and cars usually get far less than the window sticker says we took the car back to two other dealers for the same fuel mileage problems   and not once could they identify a problem after the car s warranty expired   i looked into it myself   within half an hour   i found a vacuum tube coming from the exhaust manifold that had been manufactured with a hole in it   i replaced the tube with a new one   and the car instantly ran better and started getting about mpg better   not one of the three dealers i had taken the car to was able to find it other problems we ve had radio turns itself off and on occassionally   usually on long trips   we ve had the radio replaced twice   with no success passenger side headlight burns out after about a week   it just started doing this about a month ago   but i m not bothering trying to fix it since i m turning the car in this week a thumping noise comes from the front suspension when going over bumps   there was a recall for this   and i took it in   the thumping stopped for a few months   but started up again   claims they can t hear it our rear passenger side window fell into the door a few weeks ago   and of course it did it while it was pouring down rain   i had to try to fix it in the rain too   the cable that pulls the window up and down is attached by a flimsy plastic piece that broke off   the window is currently being held up by a piece of wood i wedged inside the door our transmission will downshift for no reason   i ve had the car on cruise control   on a flat freeway   and the transmission will downshift itself   race the engine for a few seconds   and then upshift again   it does this pretty frequently on the freeway   the plastic moulding around the rear wheelwell came loose and was barely hanging on   i had to stop   and snap the piece back on the passenger side air bag cover has started opening up three times   all three times   we had to take the car in and they fixed it the a pillar trim on the driver side came loose   and was about to fall off   the dealer replaced it both rear seatbelts have malfunctioned   the passenger side seatbelt doesn t latch securely   and will often times undo itself   the driver s side rear seatbelt will often lock after being pulled out about   inches   which makes it useless and unuseable   when it does that   it will stay locked for several hours   so anyone sitting there can t use the seatbelt on that trip   of course the dealers were unable to duplicate either of those problems our trunk opens itself randomly   we ll be driving down the street   and the door ajar light will come on   the dealer claims that is impossible   and told me that i was probabbly accidentally hitting the trunk release button on the dashboard without knowing it our windshield was hit by a small piece of gravel on the freeway   instead of creating a small pit   it caused a large crack that runs across the entire windshield   this thing has a horrible resale value   in late    the kelly blue book wholesale value of the car is about      that s for a    year old car that started out costing     more the only good thing about this car is it is pretty roomy for a small   economy   car   i m     and fit fairly comfortably in it if you want to read hundreds of other horror stories from focus owners   check out the following two web sites fordfocusbrakeproblems and nhtsa gov    go to the section to review customer complaints and defect investigations three days ago we bought a   conversion van to replace the focus with   we have almost a year left on our lease   but we opted to pay the remainder of the lease off so that we could get into something safer and more reliable   as soon as we get the check from the bank to pay off the focus   it will be going back to   good riddance  
489,0,  this car was awarded european car of the year and the north american car of the year   i was so impressed by these accolades and the positive magazine reviews that i purchased a silver zx in may     it only took a few months for it to be transformed into lemonade my family and friends warned me and i didn t listen   after owning   european cars in   years   i did something i vowed to never do   purchase an american car   problems occurred with my vehicle within the first month   a loud creaking sound was evident from the rear of the car when turning corners   after a few unsuccessful attempts of the dealership trying to fix this   one of s engineers from detroit was flown in   spot welds in the rear chassis were drilled out and replaced with rivets   this did not fix the problem   since nearly the entire interior was disassembled to resolve the creaking problem   more squeaks and rattles were now present from the plastic trim panels coming apart there were a few driveability concerns with the car that were also not resolved   the car died while driving   times and often felt like it was going to die when approaching a stop light   the gearshift lever   manual transmission   would often stick and not go into th gear   on cold winter mornings   nd and th gears had to be bypassed for the first few minutes of driving because the lever would not go into the gears   the dealership could not find any problem the car is rated   city    highway miles gallon and i never saw anything close to this   i drove    on the interstate daily and never averaged more than   mpg   the dealer said this was normal all in all   my focus zx was at the dealer   times in the first   months of ownership for a whopping total of   business days   i contacted s dispute settlement board and asked them to repurchase my vehicle under the lemon law   they reviewed my case and a few months later offered to replace my car with a brand new focus or apply my money spent toward any new product   i stood my ground and told them i would never buy another and wanted my money back   my case was heard before the board and i won   weeks later   a check was cut and i was refunded full purchase price including tax   title   and license   based upon my experiences and a few of my friends that own focuses   i try to sway everyone i know away from a the car   the initial price of the focus is low   but so is the quality   if you really need a new car and don t have much to spend   you d be better off with a hyundai   but better yet   purchase a     year old honda or toyota and have a great car without the headaches of a focus  
490,0,  geocities archangel jjn i really loved this car it was small and fun until the cowl cover cracked and it leaked into the passenger footwell every time it rained or i went to the car wash moisture entered the headlight and it needed to be replaced the cruise control stopped functioning the rear wheel bearings needed to be replaced due to a recall the wiper stopped working in the winter and needed to be replaced and before i owned it it needed new brake pads and rotors despite having less than    miles a new transmission and associated cooling hoses a new hatch strut and finally   after only having it   months and still being well within original factory warranty   it caught fire all by itself by a recall that happened   months after my incident   it ended up being totaled   see the pictures at geocities archangel jjn so far   s basic response is that it is an insurance issue   so if you think your car is protected by factory warranty against catastrophic failure   even from an issue covered by a recall   think again they ll leave you out swinging in the breeze   and you re left with only your insurance payout on the rapidly shrinking book value to pick up and start over  
491,0,  when it came time to replace my well worn   jetta   i wanted a hatchback   and the most logical choice was a golf   apon seeing the hatchback version of the focus   however   i decided to up the list of consideration to    after test driving both cars   i found the focus was by far the better deal   and walked out of the dealership with a brand new   speed   door hatchback   with the racy sounding zx badge   with a c   alloy wheels   cd stereo   and   rather useless   fog lamps for    less than a golf with only a c   the focus is a great small car   on driving alone   it is by far the best small car offered in america   the interior wouldn t be out of place in a luxury badge   the car is pleasent to drive   very quiet even at highway speeds   my only complaint   a car this size should get even better gas mileage   though it averages about   mpg highway   in city driving it can be much lower   this with the   speed standard transmission   not much better than the pinto built almost   years ago   a few months of living with the focus and i was sure this was the best economic choice i had ever made then came the recalls beginning with an axel related problem   i ve had   announced   and   pending recalls of the focus   while the dealers are quick to correct the situation   having to make a special trip and arrangements   both recalls required leaving the car all day   with no loner   was not what i expected from a new car   in addition   the car has refused to start   different times and stalled out once   the dealer is clueless as to the source of the problem   i ve had the focus for over   years now   and am approaching the end of my warranty mileage   and wonder if i ll be put in a situation where i have to dish out my own money to fix future problems   that said   having driven friends vw s   honda s and saturns   the focus feels like a car in a higher price range than these   but it lacks the problem free nature these cars seem to have   advice   buy with caution   the   models offer a k warranty  
492,0,  my wife bought this car in   and at first   within the first   miles   the car seemed like a decent choice for a small sedan   but in the last year or so   we have regretted the day we signed the loan papers on this close to being a lemon   here s why   please note the focus in question has    miles on it currently    loud   weak engine   even when this car is driven at speeds less than   mph   there is a pronounced loud drone of the engine   at freeway speeds   gt   mph   the engine noise is as loud as a delivery truck   yes   this is a   cylinder vehicle that struggles to accelerate rapidly and labors to do anything   but the problem is not simply due to being   cylinders   in comparison to our other car a   honda civic    cylinders   the civic appears to be a v and the engine noise is not    as loud    bizarre problems   including a trunk door that takes two slams of the lid to close down from three after a trip to the mechanic   a gas gauge that never shows full even when the tank is full leaving the pump   this was due to bad gauge sensor anther trip to the mechanic   in addition the fuel pump on this car went out at    miles   trip number   to the mechanic   the brakes and engine belts squeak horribly whenever the outside humidity goes much above    the belt squeaking is especially embarassing   i ve had people at stopped traffic signals ask me to roll my window down to say    excuse me   but is there something wrong with your car sir    poor fabric in seats where everything   lint   hair   etc   sticks to like a magnet   we ve tried the most powerful industrial strength vacuums out there with no luck    rapid depreciation   the bottom line is if you buy a focus expect to keep it awhile as it depreciates at a rate much faster than your average car   we owe in excess of   k on the loan   according to edmunds the car is worth about    for a trade in   if sold privately a loss either way we might choose to sell it    driving comfort   the ride for this car is stiff and the front drivers and passengers seats are cramped   at higher speeds   gt   mph   the car shutters and every road bump is felt   long trips are an exhausting experience needless to say   this is the last   my wife and i plan to buy   a honda civic or toyota corolla are much better uses of your car buying dollar   in addition   there have been numerous recalls on this lemon   i feel like i should make a standing appointment with the mechanic  
493,0,  i got the car from sunnyvale   in my opinion it seems to be a good place to buy a car but not a good place to service it   if you want to service your car in the san jose area   better go to frontier in santa clara i got the zts sedan which had every option possible except advance track and automatic transmission   one reason i picked zts over se is that zts has standard    wheels with    tires i test drove focus zts with an automatic and i must say that it felt very lame   it shifts up at very low revs   while the engine likes to be revved    later i learned that the new automatic transmissions   as well as modern engines    learn   some program parameters during the first    miles   this might explain the lameness of the focus with automatic   but that is just a guess the version with sp manual transmission is fun to drive   the engine revvs very smooth   the power is available from low rpm to well over rpm   it is easy to cruise at mph in th gear   but i can also rev it and have fun    the thing i really like about this car is that it feels very stable in curves   so far i have never felt that the car was loosing grip in a curve   and i have tried to push it a few times the breaks are also very good   and abs helps when it rains and now the complaints after two weeks   about   miles   i noticed a bulge on the hood near the right hinge   i took it back to the dealer   it took me a while to convince them that the bulge was something that had to be fixed and that it wasn t me that caused it   the convincing part was that i found a bent steel rod under the front seat   which turned out to be a support rod for the hood   it appears that some moron   at factory   dealership   closed the hood with the rod still supporting it it took them   days to fix the hood   as it had to be repainted   it looks like new   i only hope that the paint will last as long as the original    i got a rental car for the period that my car was being fixed   however they initially did not want to pay insurance on the rental car   eventually i got a    voucher to compensate for the money i spent on rental car insurance the center arm rest seems to have been designed for cars with automatic transmission   it is in the way when lifted up   and one has to lift it up to use a hand brake comfortably in may   when the outside temperatures got higher i noticed that the dashboard started squeaking like mutilated squirrel   sounded like two pieces of styrofoam rubbed against each other   it took me   visit to the service department before they finally fixed it by replacing the instrument panel bezel   before they decided to replace it   they tried spraying wd    or something like it   between the bezel and the dash and loosening the screws that hold it   this made the dash rattle   so that i had to take the car back to the service where they tightened the crews   which made the dash squeak again    altogether   this was very annoying experience at about   miles i started noticing a rattle coming from the rear of the car   it was noticeable   and sometimes pretty loud   when driving over mph   it was difficult to locate precisely   but it seemed to come from somewhere near rear right wheel i brought the car twice to the dealership to have this fixed   first time they thought that some exhaust hanger was missing   it was installed but the rattle continued   some   miles later i brought the car again with the same problem   this time i went for a test ride with a mechanic   he could verify the rattle   he said that it was   a tough one   but did not do anything about it apart from adjusting rear right door which was a bit misaligned   basically   he told me to see if this helps   and if not then to come again    i am sick of coming again and again to the dealership fortunately   someone at focaljet forum gave me a hint to look at the aerodynamic deflectors placed in front of rear wheels and suspension   it took one look at it to figure out that they were the source of the noise   i wrapped some duct tape around them and the rattle stopped what it shows   is that the sunnyvale mechanics do not really know the cars they work on    in summer i noticed that   on hot days the engine has much less power   especially between rpm and rpm   in part   this must be caused by airconditioning taking power from the engine   however   the power loss is there also with ac off i read some discussions at internet focus forums   and it seems that the power loss in higher temperatures is partly caused by bad design of the egr   exhaust gas recirculation   system   it seems that the egr valve opens too fast and at the wrong time   robbing the engine of power when it needs it most   i e   while accelerating pity   because with the hesitation between   and rpm the car does not feel zippy anymore and is not such fun to drive   so in summer the car is fun to drive only in the mornings when the air and engine are cool at   miles the battery light came on   this time i took the car to be fixed at frontier   i also requested them to make and program   spare keys   i lost one   do something about squeaking rear brakes   and check if tsb      technical service bulletin   applied to my car   it is supposed to fix the engine stumble hesitation by reprogramming engine computer frontier did a good job on my car   they replaced alternator   made and programmed two keys for     replaced rear brake shoes   reprogrammed engine computer   and washed the car i haven t driven the car much since then so i can not tell yet if the stumble hesitation has been fixed so what are my conclusions sometimes i like my focus   e g   morning drives to work   and sometimes i wish i bought a different car   e g   drives on hot weekends when it feels   felt   weak    i still have to see if this problem has been fixed would i buy another focus   i don t think so   if i were to buy a similar sized car now   i would probably go for a wv golf or jetta would i buy another   i do not know   i think has some potentially good cars   they have good ideas   but they fail in implementation i do have another   an escape   but i think that its build quality isn t great either i think i will try another car brand   when time comes to replace my current fords  
494,0,  our   year old son purchased a focus a few months ago   paying     for this car   we didn t expect luxury   but we did expect good quality   so far that s not what we ve found shortly after purchasing it   he received notification of two recalls   which of course the dealer promptly took care of   from there   however   it s been lots of little things things that will undoubtedly eventually nickel and dime him to death   if the car even retains that kind of value the focus feels like it s made of tin and plastic   leaning on the hood or trunk will sometimes cause buckling   the bumpers are constantly detaching from the vehicle and the front side panels are   too   my son has finally resorted to a type of automotive   super glue   to fasten these parts back onto his car   he has tired of the weekly trips to the dealership the focus is an attractive car at an attractive price   and this is sadly part of the reason young buyers are flocking to dealers to buy them   they are sporty and economical   fifteen dollars a week is all my son has ever spent on gas   and some weeks have seen quite a few miles yet i remain concerned about the safety of this vehicle   as it doesn t appear to be solidly built and besides   who wants to trust a vehicle to protect its occupants if the outside parts keep falling off aside from these complaints   my son does insist that his focus runs like a dream   it has good pick up and is easy to handle   his is a standard my son s focus came with cloth interior and a great stereo system   the cd player was included i guess if one is looking for a cheap set of brand new wheels   the focus is enticing   however because so many young people are purchasing it   due to its affordability   i do have deep concerns regarding safety  
495,0,  i was recently married   my husband and i decided we should buy a car   after much consideration and various test drives   we decided against the and went with the   focus   my theory being   where would we put the kids in a truck   this was my first mistake the car was awesome   we had a great time bombing around in our brand new car and decided to take it on a road trip when i drove him back to california where he works   i was to stay in california for a few weeks then return back to toronto while down here   i was in an accident   i was rear ended by some punk kid   the damage was minimal to my untrained eye so i figured that it would be in the shop for a couple of weeks and then i would have my car back   this was six weeks ago   what is the deal you ask   well let me tell you puts out manuals of car parts   little pictures with all the parts drawn neatly in a little square   and then a list of all the parts you would need to fix the car   unfortuantely   someone   somewhere was slacking on the job or was too high to realise what he was drawing and perhaps turned to drawing little doodles instead of the parts   the result of this is the one part stopping my car from being on the road does not exist   it is not on the parts list   nor in the diagram of little pictures   so what does this mean for me   this means endless hours on the phone to my insurance   customer service   who   by the way   assure me that there will be an internal investigation   the body shop who is fixing my car   who are actually a dealership body shop   and my parents   trying to figure out a way to get my vehicle and get me home   rental bills so i do not have to be stuck sitting here with no car   are piling up and although my insurance is reimbursing me   that does nothing for me now apparently this is not the only problem they have had   seatbelts   transmissions   seats   panels etc have all taken between   weeks and   months to arrive at various body shops in north america   leaving you   the proud automobile owner   stranded this has been one of the worst experiences of my life and i dread even thinking about what would happen if i were to be in another car accident with this vehicle  
496,0,  when my   explorer sport s transmission died   see my review   i ended up with a focus   door as a rental for the week coming from a big and tall suv to a small   city commuter   i was worried about the focus being under powered but i was pleasantly surprised at the pep    even with an automatic transmission engine peppy for city driving    even with auto transmission   highway driving is also smooth interior extremely cool dash design   though the dash is ergonomically correct   some cost cutting is noticeable with the lack of warning lights and lights on buzzers   front seats were firm and supportive   rear seating    even in the   door    was fine for   smaller adults   rear hatch stores a big trunk space over time   however   the seat fabric has begun to wear   the seatbelts anchor s plastic guards are cracking and the cheapie no tach dash is pretty uninformative quality   revised though the car started off very tight   fit and finish seemed to deteriorate after a year overall good design that seems to have suffered major quality control problems   commuter car in the   door format   much more stylish than a civic   i did feel as if i was sitting very low to the ground    but then again   i was coming off an explorer   the   door models lack the daring design of the   door and the station wagons are even more conservative  
497,0,  it is a    got it used about a year after it came out so it was basically as close to factory condition as you r going to get without actually being there   so let me talk about ours   the cigerette lighter in the back does nt work is our only major problem   but we don t need that anyway   so we ve been in several accidents with it   some in which would be classified as   quot totaled quot   to the cost   even though it wasn t all that bad anyway   so we got them all fixed   and it still runs pretty good   sometimes the heat doesn t work but besides that there little or no problems br br  
498,0,  i bought my aerostar   from a friend about a year ago   with over    miles   for a   bucks   he sold this van because he disliked the van comparing to toady s new minivans   the aerostar is far from the good minivans   makes big noise at driving   steering wheel makes also big noise at each turn   rides very bumpy   it s not comfortable to drive long trips   toady s new cars    minivans are very smooth   the aerostar is not   braking is also poor   all passengers are feeling that i m braking now   if you don t wear seat belts   you almost fall down when braking   when i stop   at a traffic light   etc   the van shudders and shivers also the power windows doesn t work fine   i have to push it down with my hands   to   help   the power   the sliding door is not closed unless you close it with full power   and you hear a thunder noise   and the whole van shudders   so every time you have to try about    times to close it   i also hate the design of the aerostar   also had a lot of problems w   the air conditioning   the stereo system sounds very bad i also dislike that you have to climb in into the van   like a big suv   the new minivans today   excluding chevy astro   has a low step in height   which is great on the other hand   it has a very strong engine   it s a truck like van   with the powerful and noisy engine   and    it s better than nothing   it s my first vehicle   so i m happy with it   until i ll have money for a better one   i need a minivan for the room of it   i ve once rented a windstar    and another time the pontiac montana    and they re unbelievable   very smooth   good braking   comfortable seating   and nice panels   with a lot of features   so when i got back to my aerostar i wasn t happy   no features   no nothing   just a simple   heavy duty   minivan sorry for my english  
499,0,  all in all the van has proven to be dependable   lots of little annoying things went wrong   the most serious was that the large sliding door quit opening   i have not had that fixed yet   tape player quit working along with the remote radio panel   bought the van in   and all these quit in    power mirrors don t work now   ac fan went out last year   all these except for the large sliding door seem small   front end hard to keep inline   but arkansas roads seem to help that   is still strong after    miles and mechanically i would not be scared to drive this van cross country   it would take alot to fix all the little things wrong to make this a real nice van again   plan on trading soon no problem with or drivetrain   put starter on last year br br  
500,0,  my father in law bought this car new in nov     it has the   l v   i don t have to tell you about the   l v from the beginning he had problems with the electrical system   repaired the tail light assembly   the tachometer went out at   year   needed brakes at   years      miles   master cylinder and calipers at    miles     years   my wife inherited it in    at that time we had a   t bird that i loved   it had the v and was a blast to drive   very reliable   any way   at    miles the brakes went out again   one winter morning the temperature dropped to    degrees   when my wife started the car the left turn signal came on all by itself   the right side window kept going up and down all by itself   the horn started blowing and the head lights started flashing between high and low beam and then off   this car has a mind of it s own   at    miles i was in a parking lot and started to back out and brushed up against a guard rail and the whole front bumper assembly came off   cost       both door panels are falling apart   the drive side door hinges broke and had to be replaced   now the hinges on the passenger side need replacing   at    miles it had a blown head gasket   cost       the car has    miles on it now and last night my wife pulled out into traffic and the car stalled   she almost had a wreck   some wonderful people pushed it off the road for her and that is where it is now   going to have it towed to a junk yard today and buy a intrepid do not buy this car unless you are a very rich person that wants to throw your money away br br  
501,0,  i loved this car until everything started going wrong with it   it has been in the shop numerous times just for recalls   how safe can that be   then it has been in the shop for repairs and they can never seem to find the problem now for the good things   the interior is very roomy and comfortable   ours is loaded with power everything which is great   power windows are the best when you are alone in the car and need that passenger window down   same with power door locks   the car gets decent gas mileage on the highway but really sucks it down in the daily driving around town   all in all we are pleased with it but are ready to pay it off and start with something else br br  
502,0,  this car has been a nightmare   it is currently sitting in front of my house with a tarp over it because the windows no longer work   or the locks   or the a c   or the headlights   before you jump to conclusions about how i have abused the car   let me give you the cars history    my dad bought a beautiful black t bird lx with red interior   within a week of having the car the back tail light almost caught fire and has been broken since   the car was purchased in late november    no problems   my dad barely puts any miles on the car    babied as usual   car has always been washed at least once a week   and waxed roughly once every two months the car did require lower ball joints and brakes this year though   and an alternator   car still does not have k on it    not a bad year for the car   the door handle on the passenger side breaks loose this year though car still does not have k on it   car requires brakes again at   thousand miles the transmission goes out   the a c compressor also begins to whine a bit lower ball joints again this year the speedometer breaks also    i purchase the car from my dad in february   i gut the stereo system install alarm   and new rims   the car begins to float all over the road   at k it needs tie rods   it also needs brakes again   and a sensor goes out and the car leaves me stranded   the door hinges on the drivers side actually brake in august of this year   late that year the transmission has to be taken back   this was a big year for the car   it took   dollars worth of work to find the sensor that made the car shut off for no reason   car once shut off while i tried to cross the street and i almost got hit by all three lanes of cars   the headlights die now both sides of the doors have broken loose   ca nt run the a c or the car will overheat   another alternator   and the entire ignition need to be replaced   and a battery and more brakes and the car is almost impossible to keep in one lane while on the interstate   in late december the a c dies car has   thousand miles on it now    in january the headlights die for the second time and i have to replace the blinker switch has headlight controls in it also in march the locks begin to stick on the doors and the front end has a terrible sound coming from it   in april i finally replace the rack and pinion lower ball joints and a few bushings for   dollars still no a c in car    days later it looks like it is going to rain for the first time in months   i go to roll up the windows   and neither of them work   the power locks no longer work   nor does the a c   in a rainstorm with a trashbag over the windows i sit in the car at a friends house   and replace the window switches   now one window works and still no locks   while driving the car home the headlights died for the final time and so did the radio final mileage     cosmetically the car has no dents or scratches   and still shines like new the interior is spotless no rips in the leather   no stains   nothing   from reading the posts on this site   its half and half on the reliability   but overall these cars are a nightmare   i would not recommend buying a t bird to my worst enemy br br  
503,0,  so there are a ton of reviews about this car saying it is the greatest   well it is   but i m still here to burst your bubble   it has problems   i personally own one   it s a    thunderbird lx with    miles on it   i love it but it doesn t always seem to love me back   recently it has been having problems with the thermostat on the engine   you may say    quot no biggie   it s only a    part that can be easily replaced quot   and you d be correct   it is   however it keeps on breaking   the problem is not the thermostat   because i have tried different brands   many with lifetime warranties   and they still keep on breaking   still no biggie but it regulates your engine s temp   and you don t want it over heating   also   every once in a while the spark plugs will miss a step   causing the car to shake   many say that the engine put in these cars is the worst one makes   but i m not sure about that   anyway   have fun with any car you choose br br  
504,0,  my husband owns a   thunderbird and it has caused us nothing but a headache and has put a whole in our bank account   at    miles he had a problem with the electrical system   at    miles he had to have all of the brakes and drums and etc   replaced in which was a cost of     at    miles the head gaskets blew the cost to repair this was      now there is    miles and two of the mounts need to be replaced   the driver side door won t stop chiming when you have the lights on   the molding on the drivers side is coming off   i know my husband isn t to blame for these problems because he babies his cars and he is a very excellent driver   this car does have excellent pickup   handles uphill with ease   when driving in rain or snow the rear end tends to sway while making turns   the interior is very spacious   seats five with enough extra space to seat six   even if all the passengers were six feet tall   the trunk space is very spacious the long roomy look this car has is very appealing but once you own one it s not worth it s looks br br  
505,0,  everyone has heard of all these great new innovations that are intended to make our everyday lives more convenient you know   disposable diapers   disposable cameras   disposable contact lenses   and i believe this was s idea of a disposable car   i was so in love with my electric blue    probe se   sport edition   in the beginning   as i drove it off the lot with its   miles on it i lovingly named it poindexter and vowed to wash it on a bi weekly basis   it was truly cherished a car among cars mine   i loved the way it handled   the sleek body style   the gas mileage   the way men turned their heads as i drove past   but all that came to an end   except the head turning    tee hee   within the first year   it all began when the vanity mirror fell off the passenger side sun visor   it may sound small   but you would be amazed how many people use that thing   shortly after the trunk on the hatchback decided to wimp out and tried to decappatate you at the first moment you weren t looking   the windows rattled every time you drove and my cigarette lighter fizzled out on me   good thing it was all under warranty   right   well   some of it took responsibility for and fixed as well as expected i suppose   everything else was cosmetic and wasn t included in the warranty   great   although all women know that cosmetics are important   i ve never considered myself stuck up enough to really care about trivial things   it got me to school   to work   to parties   and those were what mattered   until suddenly it didn t   about   months before the warranty was up   the battery gauge on the dash would go from the dead center to   quot oh no   absolutely no juice quot   every time i would come to a stop   driving a car without stopping is actually kind of difficult   so back to the shop   quot dex quot   went   two weeks later they deciphered it was nothing more than the battery and i was free to pay the    that was not covered by the warranty   yee haw well   to make a long story short   my warranty expired and suddenly they figured out exactly why my car was acting funny   it needed a new set of belts   then when that didn t fix it   it needed a new altenator   then a distributor cap   then spark plugs and eventually an idle speed   the brakes have been done   times   the last time costing me    because i needed shocks   calipers   rotors   and god knows what else   i ve needed   new rims    sets of tires    new antenna motors    and a partridge in a pear tree   and have had to deal with the fact that the material is dangling off the ceiling of my car and my seatbelts won t go back in their slots   i have sunk the value of my car into my car in the past year alone   now   i am a girl   and guys seem to always think i was ripped off   but what do you do when you re single and your car is sitting in a shop with the wheels off    no   crying didn t help   i tried that   reliability is definitely not it s strong suit   well   i can finally write this opinion with a clear conscience   because as of yesterday i am a chevy owner   i finally got my    silverado   extra cab   step side and will not have to worry about dealing with again   i have named it maverick   in hopes that a tougher name might make for a tougher vehicle     it is so nice to have a vanity mirror again     
506,0,  i bought my   probe se because of the sporty look   the price   and the great things i d heard about cars   my one and only mistake was thinking a car seat would fit in the back wrong   well   not totally wrong it will fit   but not comfortably   i ve had great luck with my probe so far   and i do love it   it s gone over    miles with no problems   it s only been in the shop   times   and only for oil changes and new tires   it gets great gas mileage   which is good for a family   but like i said there s just not enough room   my probe has more than adequate power   rides great and is great to look at too    this would be a great car for a single guy or girl   but if a family car is what your looking for pass this one by   the seats aren t the easiest thing to clean    hard to get in the grooves   should junior spill some ice cream   or drop his lollipop   and with such a sharp look   who wants ice cream and lollipop all over the seats anyway   though reasonably priced   mine was around     used   you can get a much better deal on a more   quot family quot   type vehicle     
507,0,  all i can say about this car is   yuck   i can t wait to get rid of it   everything rattles   squeaks   and knocks   paint is peeling off of the side view mirrors and the hatcback hydraulics are shot   the passenger room is close to non existent my fiancee is     lbs and she complains about space   the interior materials are cheap plastic and crack very easily   the controls are inconvenient and hard to reach   the back seat is a joke   the shift action is   squishy   and non responsive   the engine sounds like it is going to blow at   rpm s and the acceleration is obscenely non existent   it has this mysterious stalling problem at times and the cel light pops on and off at random times   it handles   ok   i have previously owned an integra gsr   and a nissan maxima   both of which i was sad to see go   especially after owning this pile   i have even owned a   subaru loyale that i liked better than this car and i had to change the alternator in the subaru   times and the tranny once   this is the worst car that we have ever owned   don t buy  
508,0,  i bought a   probe in    with its sweet lines and smooth ride   a black beauty with the spoiler   the kind of car all your friends get jealous over   but when it was less than a month after i bought it   that it went into the shop to stay from march until september   my friends were less than jealous   going from one mechanic to another   with people running tests on it   after rebuilding the transmission for about     i got it back in september or so   i got to drive it until the end of february   and back to the shop again   both times the o d light had come on flashing   and over   mph   the car would jerk forward   but the transaxle   as the manual suggests   was not the problem   once again the transmission was worked on from february march until almost june   when i went to pick it up   i got about   miles away from the shop   and it was running hot back to the shop for the water pump to get fixed   then   after   months   i once again went to pick it up again   and the engine was revving on its own   so now it sits at the dealership automotive department   with a new they discovered after replacing the timing belt   that that was not the cause of the trouble   timing belt   with a suggestion that it might be the throttle body   for another    or so   if anyone has web links to other troubled probes help br br  
509,0,   sick of politics   after this election year   who wouldn t be   i mean   all those amusing bumbles and hyperbolic exaggerations   luckily   things have subsided for now   until   years from now   that is   but do exaggerations exist elsewhere to fill the void   let s try one    the new escape has just set the new standard for mini suv s   any response to that   will the media clamor to call me a liar   i think not   why   because the escape   has   raised the bar on this class   and other car manufacturers had better fall in line   quick   still   there s a caveat   and it s no less important to consider before going out and buying this vehicle b the mini suv class offers several choices   yet still offers you little   on one hand   you have the small   car based   underpowered toys like the honda cr v and toyota rav   although it s been redesigned   and on the other side   you have a relative behemoth   the nissan xterra   in my opinion   the only compromise in this class was the suzuki grand vitara   until now many reviews of the escape on this site describing test drives came out when the vehicle just came out   this made little sense to me because a glitch in the vehicle s steering forced dealers not to allow the car for test driving purposes   in my city   at least   at any rate   when i finally received the phone call that i could   i was there at a moment s notice   here are my impressions b exterior     as you may or may not know   mazda had a pretty large role in creating the design for this vehicle   the mazda version is sold as the tribute   and has a few cosmetic and option differences with the escape   but essentially the two cars are identical   the design is a unibody construction   which automatically lands this vehicle as more of a   road   cruiser than   off road   warrior   still   the vast majority of drivers out there are going for image and or carrying capacity   so not too many will complain about that the escape is what needed to enter the small suv fray   it s the smallest suv in its model line   and is just a little shorter than a honda cr v   it sits on    firestone wilderness ht tires   no cause for alarm here   and has a ground clearance of almost eight inches   which make it a decent beach cruiser or very   lite   off roader the rear tire isn t mounted on the back like other sport utes in its class which saves you tons of money in the event of a rear collision do i like how it looks   does it matter   the decision is yours   of course   i have seen the escape photographed with more aggressive rims   and liked that look much more   if i had two words to describe how it looks   i d say   actively pedestrian   i prefer the mazda tribute s exterior to this one   it has more of an elegant flair to it that i find appealing b interior     okay   let s hit on the   pros   here   the dash is a user friendly design   with everything readable and within reach   the white faced gauges   xlt model   are quite nice as well   what s more   you can fit up to   cubic feet of cargo with the rear seats folded down   not bad at all for this class   bikes and camping gear should fit comfortably   that   is   what you re considering this vehicle for   right   i was also quite impressed with the interior room provided for front and rear passengers   in fact   i d say that no other suv in this class really sizes up well with the escape in this category   save for the honda cr v   there are plenty of very useable cubbies and pockets for you to store your stuff   too   including two nicely sized cup holders that don t get in the way of things   the air conditioner works fine   although the cooler weather here didn t give it a great bench test   the in dash cd sound system is decent   at best   an available mach system would definitely be on my list of must haves the   cons   oh   there s the minor things   the column shifter felt strange and ambiguous   kind of like one found on an   s buick station wagon   if that makes any sense   i didn t find the seats particularly comfortable   although the material did seem like it could stand up to some abuse   perhaps the available leather option would help things out a bit   no models on the lot had the option   so i couldn t try it   but   those are minor things after all   there s   major   problems too   though    the most glaring fault of the interior is   quality     even if we were to ignore the fact that hard plastic abounds in this suv   i guess it s to be expected   it was very hard for me to ignore the fact that the bottom door panels were coming off and i could see the metal underneath   equally hard to ignore was the tinny   clang   sound the doors made when i shut them   a far cry from the suzuki grand vitara s   thud   a small rattle seemed to be coming from the front of the dash on the passenger side when the road got a little bumpy    engine     when i reviewed the suzuki grand vitara   i said it had an engine that was the perfect size for its class   well   i was wrong   the    duratec v that is available on the escape certainly levels the playing field   i have yet to see an suv in this class that has as much off the line grunt as this one does   like a few of the reviewers here   i agree that power does start to weaken as you hit highway speeds   but i still would call this vehicle a very competent highway passer   the escape s base engine is the one found in the focus    l   hp zetec four   i didn t try it   but would strongly recommend the v option   predicts the v model will outsell it s four cylinder model   the   hp duratec v is taken from the taurus   in fact   the larger of two v engines offered in that car   the mazda tribute also has this engine available   the automatic transmission makes sophisticated shifts   and hesitates only a little when the pedal is floored b ride     for an suv   not bad at all   sure   there s more road and wind noise than i d like   the engine also makes itself known all too often   perhaps some more insulation would help   still   there s other aspects that should be praised   on the highway   the suspension makes this suv a nice cruiser   bumps are muffled very well   and there is very little annoying rebound on nastier irregularities    handling     out of the mini suv s that i ve driven   the escape is certainly one of the best compromises of ride and handling   no   i wouldn t call it cat like   but easily   car   like   there is very little body lean during everyday driving   i took a turnaround curve at a speed that i thought was too fast initially until i realized that the escape was holding up admirably   braking is very impressive   once again car like   in fact   further research indicated that the escape stops   better   than some cars    car and driver   made the escape stop in only   feet from   mph     mph   which is the best they said they had seen in a production suv   wow the escape is primarily front wheel drive   although it does send power to the rear wheels if it detects any slippage   just my luck   it was raining the day of my drive   and although the control trac ii awd system probably engaged during the course of the day   i never noticed it   there is   by the way   a wd switch for full time wd   which i did use later   not surprisingly   there is no low range setting for serious off road treks b safety     the escape is equipped with your usual features like airbags and abs   xlt and upward   i definitely would chalk some points up on the escape s behalf as far as braking is concerned as for offset crash tests   the escape didn t fare too well   scoring   marginal    one step above   poor    rankings are as follows   poor   marginal   acceptable   good   in other crash tests performed by the nhtsa   the escape did better front driver   five stars front passenger   four stars front side impact   five stars rear side impact   five stars rollover rating   three stars b reliability     ahh   here s the caveat i alluded to in the beginning   you thought i had forgot   didn t you   i have always   always been wary of an introductory model car   and i urge you to consider that yourself   in fact   the escape tribute was scheduled to arrive sooner to showrooms   but quality concerns delayed things somewhat   i have already read of a few recalls on edmund s town hall   where the discussion topic is called   mazda tribute escape problems   the few quality glitches that i picked up on during my drive   the rattles   the paneling coming off   didn t help things too much   either   would i   dis courage you from buying it now   yes   would i   en courage you to wait a little while to test the waters first   yes   obviously   i m probably going to get a few nasty comments from happy owners   and that s all fine and dandy   i m happy for you that after   days of ownership nothing has gone wrong   but what happens when you hit    miles   or    miles   i ve been studying cars for a long time   and   be careful   is all i have to say b value     when it comes to dollars and cents   the escape makes plenty of sense   i made a rhyme   happens all the time   can i borrow a dime   the v xlt i had included all the features i would require   minus the mach stereo   these included the v engine   abs   cruise control   an in dash cd player   air conditioning   remote keyless entry   power everything   and fog lamps   all for a price of around      i feel this is a very appealing value quotient that is being offered here   especially considering the amount of power that the v engine provides b the verdict   why must i always be the one who s not politically correct b this vehicle has a lot going for it   the only serious   and it is important   glitch is the concern for quality   i will watch how the escape performs as the months pass   if and when i am proven wrong   i will change my tune faster than al gore changes his personality or george w   bush can say   subliminal   for now   however   the   caveat   stands as pretty stong opposition to the   new suv standard   that i spoke of   once addresses these issues however   and they will   other small suv manufacturers had better adjust   or the electorate will leave   em without votes b average score     out of    b vara s personal rating   until reliability reports improve     out of   
510,0,  having recently suffered through a disastrous experience with a   explorer sport   i ended up in an escape xlt which i thought would ultimately be a better choice the escape is a thoroughly modern suv    well proportioned with a large interior   it matches or betters the explorer in comfort in almost every area   the exterior design is efficient looking though not as stylish as the toyota rav   in the forest green   i ve had people mistake the escape for the new rover freelander b the interior b the leather seats are not as firm   contoured or supportive as the fabric seats in the explorer sport   the dashboard styling is disappointing generic   and whoever designed the automatic gear shifter arm should be shot because one can t see the defrost button   power outlets are not designed for cell phones to be used and plugged in    they are too low   and if you use a speaker cell phone cradle   the hockey stick of a shifter will get in the way interior space for   passengers is very good   fine for    in fact   if you compare the specs   the escape interior is almost identical to the larger explorer ergonomics are good everywhere else    gauges are the currently trendy white with black markings   the dash seems to be made of a cheap   hard shell plastic as opposed to the cushioned dash of the explorer   i also have a wonderful   cd sound system that reminds me of the mach   system in the   unfortunately   on a very hot day   the cd system mysteriously failed for the afternoon   and recently   the rear window wiper failed as well also disappointing was that the escape didn t have the same back lit switches as the explorer has   power windows alone should be back lit at night   the explorer also had puddle lamps which were very handy b engine b the v engine is smooth and torquey though not much better than the explorer v for gas mileage in the city   highway driving seems to yield better mileage than the explorer   this is apparently a derivation of the v used in the taurus b dealer network b the first time i ve dealt with a los angeles area dealer   i was mortified at the poor support in the area of post sales   after taking the escape off the lot   i spent the first weekend documenting a few things that needed to be tightened   fixed or touched up   when i brought the vehicle back   you would have thought i had asked them for their livers   i tried a different dealer who surprised me by telling me to go back to the dealer i bought the car from   hardly a unified team b recalls   with the number of recalls on the escape   i ve received   so far   the dealer network should be helluvalot more supportive to make sure that these cars are    given the firestone debacle with the explorer   the escape should be job one   when you get a recall   the dealers don t seem to see how inconvenient it is to take the car in in the morning   get a ride to work   get a ride back to the dealership b driving b the escape is a pleasure to drive in the city and on the highway   great pick up   a commanding view of the road and yet environmentally friendly than the giant expeditions or excursions i see   very easy to park   the seats could be more supportive    especially given what the car can do   with all the talk about suv rollover   the escape startles traffic light racers with its speed and handling capabilities   surprisingly   the turning circle is bigger than the explorer so u turns end up being   pts b overall b this is the first rational sized suv and it made me rethink what city dwellers really need in an suv   the escape is a nice compromise but in its first year   iffy quality   poor dealer support and poor gas mileage would make me choose something else or wait another year   the escape should be a very good car by next year once all the bugs and recalls are ironed out   don t forget    this is mazda engineering   the mazda twin is called the tribute i m looking at the pt cruiser for my next car   see my review   because its size and proportions fit my needs   the styling is a lot more interesting than the escape   the interior is a lot more innovative   and the bad dealer experiences finished off my   year loyalty to the make  
511,0,  i was excited to get this vehicle as my next lease vehicle as i thought the styling was good and offered utility in a better package initial impressions were good as they were based on the engine performance and handling   both are excellent and it went pretty well in serious snowfall as well as i lived with it   some interior cheap details started showing up   i know the plastic world   and has used the cheapest plastics possible on this interior   my seat panels   next to the center console on the seat frame   are warped so badly that they will not stay in place   they pop off on one side   the seat belt cover on the b pillar is cracked and fell off   the interior light is horrible   instruments are fine   but the dome light stinks   you have to turn it on with a switch on the light   ok   it is on but    of its light goes to the back and when you turn it off you have to set the switch in the middle   door   position   otherwise it is off regardless of opening doors etc   trying doing that while driving and you think cell phones are dangerous   try a simple dome light switch on the ip   also   hardly any of the door   heaven forbid the steering wheel   controls are lit   i believe the only switch lit is the drivers window   also   why does the window lockout switch also lockout the driver from controlling these windows   cheap   front seats need armrests   my xls has a center console that is basically flat i think the xlt has a higher console that can be used for an armrest   needs a rear cargo net too noise   the wind and tire noise   not to mention the squeaking rear hatch window combo   is horrible   you have to turn up the radio so much that once you stop   it is blaring   i try to use my heads free cell phone headset and can t because there is too much noise   try turning on the recirculating ac you hear this big wap from the hvac system nice touch warranty repairs   my steering started screaming and whining   so the dealer replaced the entire rack and   days later the tensioner idler pulley exploded losing all belt driven accessories   which includes the power steering   and required a roadside tow    i did nt know the problem at first and losing steering assist   days after they replaced the rack is a bit disconcerting   oh   and i complained about the squeaky rear hatch and the dealership s remedy was to remove the dealership license plate frame and charge my lease co      which did nothing for the squeak of course summary   again   nice styling   nice engine   nice handling nothing else is nice   noisey   quality problems   and obviously cheap on the interior   i never get better than mpg    l v   coworkers get    with the same engine in their taurus   that is alot of wind drag  
512,0,  when i was in the market for a new suv   the new   models were just coming onto the market   there are few things i love about this vehicle   although the things i do like are major   the offroading abilities of this car are average   it has front and rear independent suspension   allowing for a nice ride on the street   but sometimes not the best choice for offroading   however   the car is short   the negative thing about this is that it limits your cargo room   which i must say   is extremely limited   the escape is almost undoubtedly safe   as s reputation goes   now for the driving   the escape s steering is not quite that of a bmw   but its ok   the pickup   however   is above average   do not buy the   cylinder engine   it is unbelievably slow   and it is pitiful that would even try to get people to buy it   the more fitting suv for this size is the mazda tribute   the escape s twin   i prefer the tighter suspension   and quasi nicer interior   consider it over the escape   in conclusion   the escape is ok for a person on the market for the average in compact suvs   and it is more of a car anyway br br  
513,0,  i recently rented one for   days to go skiing up in lake tahoe   on the road   the car   you ll see why i call it a car   performs well   it has good power   reasonable handling and for an suv   good gas mileage   the seats are not particularly comfortable   if there s a little snow on the road   it seems to do fine   i didn t need to chain up   my primary complaint is that this so called x performs poorly when it get s a little deeper   i got stuck   the x system doesn t make sense   i m in    of snow   a bit off to the side of the road   the wheels that have traction don t want to move   while the wheels that slip   continue to slip   it s as if the system only powers the wheels that have the least amount of grip   the system has an auto x mode   neither system worked   i could not discern a difference   ok   that   coupled with the questionable reliability   i think that you get what you pay for i got pulled out by a toyota runner    my next vehicle   or perhaps a pathfinder   i was also considering a honda cr v   but i suspect many of these wannabe wd systems will eventually leave me out in the cold   granted   i know real wd vehicles will also high center and get stuck   but my situation was not even close  
514,0,  well   my landscaping saga continues as i venture to get stonewall siding and this time i got to borrow a    excursion   to get the siding   you would have thought i would have learned not to do this after my less than impressive trip with a gmc yukon denali i borrowed   but i figured another great review chance and i wanted to see if this vehicle is a great as many owners hype it up to be   one of my co workers is a mother of   older kids and their explorer and king cab truck just wasn t enough space for the kids and crap they usually lug along   before they bought an excursion   we were talking one day about what their next vehicle would be when the lease runs out on the and how she wanted more space   i told her to consider the honda odyssey   toyota sienna or even a kia sedona because they a lot of room and seemed to fit her needs   she says    no way   i can t drive a minivan   i m not the minivan type   they re ugly   however   what they brought home was much uglier   i thought her views were a little uh off considering they don t tow anything and never go off road   but thought an excursion would be better than a minivan   well   it certainly costs more   problem is   they re die hard fans   i i   and there s not much in the minivan or car selection from them now   matter of fact   it s predicted that by    will only sell trucks and suvs   i okay   not really   but this wouldn t surprise me   i decided to check it out when borrowing the excursion for another landscaping mission   hoping i would not come to the same conclusion as with the denali   and that is that for these type of trips   picking it up yourself can be more time   work and money than simply paying to have it delivered   so   another half of a saturday down the drain   but with a better insight on the excursion   the excursion was introduced in   and sales have been suffering since   so much so that had to cut production in half in   b i performance   power and handling    this model has the    l v with   hp    but you can also get a    l v with   hp or   l v diesel with   hp    for a v   i was not impressed with the power   maybe i was expecting too much   it was able to move   but acceleration was minimal and not exciting   don t expect much when passing on the highway   this engine is designed to pull a lot of weight   but not fast   it can   tow up to    lbs b   with the v   but despite the dumbo like side view mirrors   this elephant would not fly   i think the major problem is it weighs in at about    lbs   by itself   not including passengers or cargo   using a lot of power to move itself   the excursion has a    gallon gas tank and recommends a minimum of   octane fuel    i had to put   gallons into it before returning it   costing me      to fill it from empty to full would cost about     at current prices in my area   this angered me because the delivery service from the landscaping place would have been cheaper   not to mention less time consuming   depending on the engine   the gas mileage ranges from     mpg to    mpg    problem is the low gas mileage has earned this model a spot on   the meanest vehicles for the environment   for   list   which can be viewed at greenercars   it will most likely make the list again for   and may not be good for the resale value   the power stroke diesel v engine requires d or d diesel and achieves marginally better gas mileage than the other two options   many owners report around   mpg and a max of   mpg   maneuverability is a big problem with the excursion   for making u turns   i found it needed at least four lanes   it s also a challenge to park in smaller   single lane parking lots because of the large turning radius required   you will most likely be readjusting in reverse at least once   i would not recommend this for regular city driving with nothing in it   the ride was fairly smooth   not really noticing small bumps   however   larger bumps sent a sharp jolt through the excursion and made the vehicle continued to sway afterwards   something i also noticed in the denali   with the back end weighed down   i was noticing every bump in the road and feeling many clunks   making for a bumpy ride   i was a little disappointed by this   expecting something this size to handle smoother   there was also a significant amount of body roll on tighter turns   shortly after getting in and taking off   i started to despise the visibility issues with the excursion and found myself constantly leaning forward and twisting around to double check everything   getting a strange kink in my neck   it s hard to get used to the larger front end and how close it is to other objects   looking through the review mirror   it s hard to see lower objects   the excursion is about     to    ft   tall    depending on if it has wd or not and the added height makes seeing over traffic nice   like the denali i drove   but i found lower visibility to be a problem making it hard to see lower objects   this model had the   optional reverse sensor   that beeps when you get too anything close while backing up like a house   parking the excursion was a hideous nightmare   i m sure many people already figured this   the excursion is about    ft   long and about    ft   wide    the average parking spot is only   ft   long   some less   no matter how you park   it will always be sticking out in the back and i was struggling to get it in as much as possible without hitting the car in front of it   the visibility issues weren t helping   it took   tries and a small portion of my sanity   also   it s tricky to park next to other vehicles close to its size with those side mirrors that stick out so far   it s important when parking it to make sure it s centered in the spot to reduce the risk of it getting hit by the door of the car next to it   i found it was always close to the lot lines making something like this easy to happen b i interior looks and features    overall interior space on the excursion is close to the honda odyssey at     cubic feet   behind the first row      cubic feet   behind the nd and    cubic feet   behind the rd   the leather captains   chairs in the front were comfortable   but got really hot in the sun   the instrument cluster is nothing to get excited about   it s very plain and dated looking with white on black gauges   black plastic and a steering wheel that was a strange shade of brown   the controls were well laid out and easy to reach for the most part   but all in black plastic and a plain layout   maybe that s the young   wild side of me talking   but i found the interior very plain and drab with lots of black buttons   know knobs   silver or wood accents   kind of generic looking   i did not like the all button climate control   it seemed awkward to use compared to the large knob based systems   i couldn t reach over and easily make adjustments while driving   the power lock and window switches were easy to reach and seemed well laid out   power adjustable pedals for different sized drivers is an option this model had   this model had the optional dvd entertainment system for the nd and rd rows   but i didn t get a chance to play with it   remote keyless entry is standard on all models the excursion can hold up to   passengers if you get the   bench rows seating option   this one s body count was only at   with two captains chairs in the front and nd and rd rows being benches   it can be as low as even   with the st and nd captains chair option   the rd row seemed roomier than the denali   but still lacked a little in leg room for my   ft   tall frame and my head was still close to the roof and could possibly hit on a big bump   up front   there are four cup holders that would hold just about any size cup and they re easy to reach   there are two interior color options   gray and beige   this one had beige that looked nice and warm   i don t think i d like the gray too much in something this size   the interior would seem too barren   the rd row of seats is fairly easy to remove   just flip them forward and pull a bar at the rear to slide them back b i exterior looks and features    the excursion has the front of the f   and up series   the front end of a work truck and it s not attractive   the front grille is larger and sticks up higher than the head lights   i think got this design from shortly after the ram series were redesigned with a similar grille   but   they did not improve it   the grille is big and blank looking with no crossbars   just the blue oval in the center   creating a lot of negative space on the front   the headlights are standard   no metallic effects or any hints of stylization   also   the large side view mirrors stick out very far from the sides   making me think of dumbo looking at the excursion from the front end   the mirrors also made me nervous parking because of the extra width to the truck   from the side   the excursion looks very boxy   it has no sexy lines or curves   just an enormous wall   getting two tone paint helps this a little   but not much   the front side windows have a gap in the front that slopes down   maybe for better visibility but i did not find how this helped a sad thing about the one i borrowed   it had been keyed twice on the driver s side   the owners weren t very happy about it and they re still in the process of getting estimates to have it fixed   fortunately   this happened before i borrowed it   i m not sure why it was keyed   but have some theories with the controversy around an suv of this size   however i didn t think that was a problem in this area   anyway   the exterior color of this one is estate green   only available to eddie bauer editions   i have to say it was not attractive   a light flat pea green that looks like it came from the   s   anyone that has ever had a baby throw up on them is probably very familiar with this color   i guess i was not the only one that thought this because while getting ready to back out in the parking lot of home depot   two guys walking behind it made puking sound affects   other color options include aspen green   hunter green with yellow hints   black   mineral gray   flat silver   white   red   true blue   light navy   and wedgewood blue   lighter blue the ground clearance is    inches   but it seemed a lot higher to me while loading the back   maybe even higher than the denali   making it harder to load heavy objects   i realize the back opens up in   parts because of the size   but i still hate it   to open the back   first the window has to be flipped up   then the lower tailgate is in two doors that swing out on either side   again   making it less convenient to load things quick   you can just lift the glass to load objects   but the height almost forces you to heave them in over the tailgate     safety    the excursion comes with   front airbags and   point safety seat belts   no safe canopy system like the expedition   but it does have side impact beams   reading other reviews   it seems everyone mentions safety as being a pro for the excursion   but i can t find safety ratings for the       or the   model   not on nhtsa or iihs   the excursion is based of the f   truck and i can t find crash test ratings for it either   also   there s no rollover information on it   so i can t say weather this is a safe vehicle or not   the only thing i know this model has going for it is weight b i parting shots    pricing on the excursion ranges from      up to       i m young and don t have a family   so i don t need to worry about a lot of passengers   but   growing up in a large family   i can understand why having a bigger vehicle is nice   i remember we had a large van that only came out of the side yard for family trips and or towing the boat   my parents used their smaller cars for commuting to work and short trips   after having experience with a couple of large suvs over the past weeks   i can understand why my parents did not want to drive the large van all the time   it s just not fun to be stuck driving something this size all the time   i felt that way about the excursion   it s big   can tow and has space   but it was not relaxing or exhilarating to drive because parking was a nightmare   forget parallel parking   visibility issues were stressful and it needs at least four lanes to make a u turn   which isn t always available   adding to the stress   get up and go power is just not there   even with the v   making for a sluggish ride   also   i can see where loading kids might not be as easy as a van or a minivan because of the added height and the extra work to get to the rd row of seats and interior space is only slightly better that a minivan   very slightly   however   the higher ground clearance can make this space less convenient to use   this is a utility vehicle with a lot of towing power   but pricey for something used for occasional uses and pricey to drive all the time   i would only recommend it for people towing all the time   like for maybe a horse business of some sort or landscaping business   off roading is not a big strength of this model because of the size   long wheel base and weight   i believe the kia sorento ad pokes fun at this   i don t know how it would handle in snow   because we just don t see that in florida   but from what i read   having wd or awd is good   but having a heavy vehicle   like the excursion   is not always good   something to look into and consider before buying if you live in a snowy area   the reason i give this model such a low rating is because it has such a limited targeted audience   very expensive for a truck that may not be used on a regular basis   has terrible gas mileage   worse than many in it s class   except the diesel model   and is not fun to drive   if you need a truck for towing   i would recommend looking for a good deal on one used to have around when you need it   if you need convenient space   look into a minivan that has equal room and is easier to drive   cheaper and gets better gas mileage   if wd is your primary need   maybe for snowy weather   look into a smaller   more nimble suv   truck or sport wagon   again   you ll save money and have more fun driving it   the excursion tried to combine all these uses in a big   expensive package with mediocre   less efficient and less usable results   this is essentially an f   truck without the rugged bed and only major strengths are towing   towing and   uh   towing   did i mention towing   but   keep in mind   many minivans and smaller suvs can tow   usually between    to    lbs   enough to accommodate many boats and trailers   the excursion seems to be targeted to the larger loads and more industrial business uses hence the narrow targeted audience   but hey   if you paint it yellow with black stripes down the side   maybe the county will help pay you to drive it  
515,0,  we bought an    eddie bauer   hoping it would have the refinements to make owning a large suv tolerable   wrong   for a list price of      you re better off buying a fully tricked out toyota sequoia   and still have plenty of money left to take a family vacation   the expedition interior materials and controls are of poor quality and feel cheap overall   including the   special   eddie bauer leather and carpeting   the nd row captains chairs are narrow   cheap   and shallow   the nd row leg room is no better than that of our acura mdx   which is generous for a mid size   but not for a full size suv   the storage in the cabin is limited with very narrow door pockets   no sunglass holder   nor a two tiered console storage system   and if you get an aftermarket rear entertainment system   they put the play unit in the console   which already houses the multi cd changer   which is out dated   requiring you to load into a multi cassette instead of directly into the dashboard unit   very hard to change cd s while on the move   taking up what little room you have to begin with   the vehicle is not outfitted to take on satellite radio either the ride is harsh   and not refined at all   the independent suspension does not make a difference on vehicle stability nor does it soften the ride   the handling is very heavy and the engine is very noisy when accelerating the navigation system is outdated   using multiple disks instead of one dvd for the whole country   the screen is tiny   and not letterbox   which is easier to read   the disks do not have the level of detail that you would expect with a multiple dvd system   in fact   the acura navi has more info on one dvd in letterbox format so why did we buy this vehicle   we needed space   plain and simple   on long road trips with our two boys and our dog   we wanted a substantial vehicle under our seats   the escalade extended was way too much money for not much value   and it s navi was outdated as well   the navigator had less room and a poorly designed cabin   with the shift taking up needed room on the console   and no   loose   storage room   to get almost as much rear storage room in the sequoia   you have to lift and remove their heavy   bulky third row seats   and then you are seatless when you get to your destination   the expedition has a fold flat rear seat   which is comfortable for an adult   or two   or three   the nissan armada did not have the curb appeal   nor the interior space of the expedition   and the large engine and drive train are in untested waters for nissan   we ll wait for the infinity version of that one   so that leaves the yukon denali xl   which was nearly as costly as the cadillac   and the suburban   which is   i m sorry to say   just a cheap chevy we wish that acura would make a bigger granddaddy to the mdx   which we feel is the best value in an suv on the market  
516,0,   introduction   you d never believe it   i d never believe it   i decided to stop by the dealer to take a look at this pos f   and compare it to the ss   the sales guy walks up and starts talking about how great a truck it is   not wanting to damage my chances   i agreed with him   then the unimaginable happened   he says    quot so   you wanna drive it quot i really had no reason to   but why not   this offer was crazy because i m an   year old kid   driving a blazer with a brand new paint job that could maybe sell for     tops   the lightening was sticker priced at over     b the drive   i didn t treat this truck like i should have for this article no all out acceleration   no tire spinning   but to tell the truth   she surprised me   the entire time i was driving the truck   it kept occurring to me that it was as fast as it was going to get i took her around the city a little bit   then a short sprint on the highway   i wouldn t buy one even if i had the cash b pros   this thing is faster than the cobra   it ll run    in    seconds and the    mile in    right off the lot   it really helps that she has a big vortec blower under the hood it was a lot more comfortable than i was expecting   the other f   i have experience in was very uncomfortable   this one i felt like i could spend the whole day in and be fine   the truck i drove had a bench seat   i think you can also get sport bucket seats   this is one up on the ss if you use it to tow just not a lot   the exhaust is in front of the tire   so you won t get carbon all over your trailer the cd player was pretty nice   i brought along a bon jovi song to test it out   since i ve heard good things about it   i wasn t disappointed   the bass was good for stock and the four speakers filled the interior nicely that s all folks   i can t think of a single other pro b neutral   the ride was better than in the other f   i ve driven   but still not as soft as a ss one thing that is nice in the lightening that is unneeded   that should be in the ss is a tachometer b cons   first of all   the obvious opinion   i think this truck is uglier than sin   its too big to be as low as it is   it looks clumsy   the ss is a much better looking truck   even the generation one lightenings are better looking you ll never get it to compete on the road tracks against the cobra   at least not in a reasonable price range the special vehicle team   svt   did a wonderful job pulling every last pony pound of torque out of the    liter v   your problem is that you ll have a heck of a time getting the truck going faster than       mph in the quarter mile   my recommendations are underdrive pullies and new heads   or just stick a real engine in there   after talking to an owner   the only thing he was able to do to his was cosmetic junk the automatic transmission is ridiculous   a sports car or truck has to have a manual transmission option   otherwise it is slow how about some gas mileage here   sure   its not as bad as her arch rival   the ss   but it is awfully low at   miles per gallon   especially with that little engine one large selling point for the ss was that it will easily tow    lbs   with the lightening   you ll be able to tow half that   which is less than the s   extreme with    smallest   rear end b overall   i d take a ss anyday   you can get the chevy for way less   and for a little bit of money   you can really get that big block moving the lightening is pretty much torqued on to death and you won t get too much more speed out of it you ll have a little more trouble finding a ss   but price difference and likeability will be much greater if you just want to go fast and don t care if it s a truck   get a camaro ss or cobra   same price   better handling   better gas mileage   more aftermarket if you re really interested in sport trucks   i have written an article on the ss my recommendation   avoid the lightening br br  
517,0,  for years i had heard favorable things about the taurus   so i took advantage of the opportunity to replace my    reliant wagon with a   taurus wagon about six months ago   the car has been reliable   handles well   for me   i m no cowboy on the road though   and i really like the lockable compartment built into the floor of the rear cargo area   but the taurus has lots of annoying design shortcomings   that aggravate me daily for starters   after locking the car with the electric door locks   all you need do to open the car door is use the handle    no need to actually unlock the door   this   feature   places children or others   such as my aged mother   in peril   since you need not actually unlock a door in order to open it   there may be childproof locks for the rear doors   i haven t checked that out   since i don t transport young children   it also means after i exit the car from the driver s side   if i want to access another car door to remove something   i have to remember to unlock all the doors   before exiting the car   the radio sound is of decent quality   but i hate radios with all pushbuttons   since you actually have to take your eyes off the road in order to turn the radio on or change bands   a raised circular power volume knob would increase operability for this radio immensely   once the radio is on   there is a convenient button located near the steering wheel that allows you to scan previously programmed channels in the current frequency band   either am   fm or fm   you can also adjust the radio volume using another button near the steering wheel   the radio also seems to be much more susceptible to outside electrical interference than the radios in any of my other cars   buick   olds and chevy   forcing me to actually turn the radio off sometimes on my way to work   road noise also competes with the radio much more so than in my other cars i have a power seat with the car   this feature is great to have   but once again   engineers have screwed it up   there is very little space between the left side of the seat near the floor and the car door   located in that small space are the power seat controls   the rear gate release and the gas tank cover release   needless to say   everytime i reach for the gas tank cover release   i hit the power seat buttons   moving the seat in some unpredictable way   to avoid this   i always open the car door   just to release the gas cap cover   the release doesn t actually pop the cover   by the way   it only releases it   thus gas station attendants will stand there   yelling at me or motioning at me to pop the gas tank release when i ve already done so   to be fair to   i did buy the car used   and maybe in a new car the gas tank cover does actually pop open when you hit the release button   my oldest car is now a   buick lesabre   i mention this only because in that car   the front arm rest doubles as a storage area for tapes   change and has a cupholder for two cups   in contrast   the   taurus   built   years after my buick   uses a ridiculous split front armrest   thus wasting the space other manufacturers have cleverly exploited for storage   oh   there is indeed a cup holder that can be pulled out from the dashboard   but its placement limits the size of the cups that can be placed there   a   oz cup of hot coffee must be mildly distorted and angled to fit in the cup holder   and more than once the cup has opened and spilled its contents upon removal   you also can t remove the cup or replace it without actually looking at the cupholder   once again limiting its usefulness i m not sure how to characterize the interior passenger space of the taurus   two adults can fit comfortably in front   and two adults plus a child will fit comfortably in the rear   but the car is just too narrow to comfortably fit   adults in either front or rear   however   the wagon does have a third seat that can be popped up from the floor of the rear cargo area   so   in principle   you can cram   occupants into the vehicle   although not very comfortably in my opinion gas mileage with the car   with mileage approximately evenly split between highway and city driving   is about   miles per gallon the taurus wagon has both a rear defrost button and a rear windshield wiper button   unfortunately   the rear defrost control is not located with the other heater and air conditioning controls   and it s actually hidden from my view when i m seated in the driver s seat   so i ve always got to hunt for it when i want it   the rear windshield washer button is also obscured by the steering wheel   another annoyance overall   i m satisfied with the taurus   but the poor human engineering will keep me from buying one again  
518,0,  my   taurus with a    liter v was recalled for a head gasket replacement   there was not charge for the replacement   however a week later the timing gear cover gasket failed   requiring replacement of both the gasket and cover   a    repair   this repair was out of my pocket because that gasket wasn t recalled   even though the cause of the failure was similar to the problems with the head gasket   if you are considering buying a used taurus   or windstar   with a    l engine you may want to find out if the timing gear cover gasket has already been changed   has issued a service bulletin on this gasket however i have been unsuccessful in trying to get a dealer to show me the actual bulletin   other than this gasket failure   air conditioner problem   twice   and a window seal problem   the car has been trouble free br br  
519,0,  i would like to start with a disclaimer   i got my    taurus used from car max back in early    it had    miles on it   or so the odometer claimed   only the gods know what the prior owners did to it   with that in mind   i bring you the saga of the used   taurus that my father bought me because of the safety record lets start of with acceleration   my first pet peeve about this car   you re trying to merge onto a major interstate   traffic is going about   mph   your merge lane is going about   mph   what does your taurus do   i ll tell you what mine does   it sits there and ponders life   existence   and the raising costs of tea in nepal while i slam my foot into the accelerator   it makes a few half hearted chugs   it waits a few more seconds   then   only then   does it condescend to speed up a bit for you i ve had some very   very close calls trying merge or get out of the way of a nut so driver due to the bad acceleration   basically   you re more than fine if you re already doing speed of traffic and need to pass   but if you need to get put on thirty to forty miles fast   make sure the oncoming vehicle has a gap of roughly a mile for you to merge into   no joke continuing   the front seat seems to be designed for and by chimps   normal sized humans end up having to bend their heads back at a strange angle to use the head rest   and the way the seats are curved is almost exactly the wrong angle for my back o k   lets move on to cost of repairs   admittedly   i bought my favorite little piece of automative engineering used   but still   here s a list of some of the repairs i ve had to have in the past three years   not including the   mile oil changes i do religiously and all that jazz water pump   fan belt    over     but it was in the middle of a snowstorm and the mechanic had me over a barrel transmission   a week after the snowstorm   about     ac    went dead towards end of first summer of ownership   spent     went dead again   trusted mechanic still couldn t fix it after giving me two free visits   dealership said they might   keyword   might   be able to fix it for     they said there were metal shavings in the ac   so i gave up   and now sweat my way through d c area summers brakes    had to be fully replaced   another    gone fan belt again    what s with the fan belt   another    gone aside from the more costly aspects of    taurus ownership   the car is rife with smaller annoyances   there are handy little buttons beside the steering wheel that allow you to search for the radio station you want   it got harder and harder to get the buttons to respond in the first year of ownership   and the main search one just eventually stopped responding at all   so   if i bang on the buttons really   really hard i can still pull up preselected stations   but no chance now of scanning the radio without leaning way over the the out of reach radio   o k   i m short   but it still seems set awfully far left then there s the drink holder   ah   the glorious drink holder   only certain medium coffee cups fit   a coke can will slide right through   so i use the cigarette lighter thing under the cup holder to support cans of coke at an awkward angle   if you get a large cup of coffee to start the day   you ll have to bend it at an angle and wrestle it out if you want a sip while driving   gauranteed you ll slosh some on your cassette player or the front seat   i think the designers had major phobias about people who drink coffee and drive   so they were trying to discourage the practice last but not least are the lights   if your front lights burn out   and there s someone at a place like jiffy lube you really hate   take it to them to get the lights changed   the poor dudes changing my burned out lights took two hours   no kidding   because they had to unscrew strange bits of metal hiding the screws for the actual lights   and they had to do so at a really odd angle   basically bruising their fingers   glad i didn t even try to change those things myself   by the way   if your rear light cracks   you have to get the entire casing replaced   including the part behind the bulb   and it ll set you back over     seemed silly to me   when it was just a bit of red plastic that had been cracked as you can tell   i m not a big fan of the taurus now   it has a good safety record for collisions   room to sit five people   and a good sized trunk   it heats up nice and quickly in the winter   largely   i suspect   because the engine seems to kick out a lot of heat that the car can t use  
520,0,  my family bought a   taurus gl sedan back in     when the car was only a year old   at the time   the car was in excellent condition   with low mileage   and a clean interior however   years later   the hands of time have taken their toll   our taurus is now pushing    miles   and the car is definitely showing its age   and then some this particular model is a bare bones vehicle   i think it may have once been part of a rental fleet   power is delivered by a wimpy   l v   which even when new produced a measly   horsepower   most mid size sedans of its time easily eclipsed its power output   now   five years later   it seems even weaker than before   the engine is mated to the standard transmission   in this case   an electronically controlled   speed automatic with overdrive   transmissions are not known for their crisp shifts   and this one is no exception   the term   quot slushbox quot   never seemed more appropriate the entire car is tan   not that there s anything wrong with the paint   in fact the paint quality is quite good   it s just so drab   this car s one asset is that it s invisible in traffic   unfortunately   it s also invisible in the parking lot   especially considering that     if i remember correctly   was the year taurus out sold every other passenger car in the states   thank god they weren t all tan the interior is   to its credit   pretty comfortable   the front split bench seat is comfortable   but my tastes lean more toward buckets   i also prefer a floor mounted shifter as opposed to this model s column mounted shifter   but it wasn t my choice   so i m stuck with it as i ve said   the car is showing its age   the engine has lost most of its pickup   what little it had in the first place   and the fuel mileage has dropped   the transmission s shifting has gotten even sloppier   if such a thing is possible   and the seats have lost most of their comfort all in all   if you re going to buy this vehicle   do yourself a favor   and find one with a better trim level br br  
521,0,  the taurus line of vehicles started in    the concept was borrowed from the german auto makers   design a car that was ergonomically correct and customer appealing inside   while being fuel efficient and aerodynamic on the outside   this car had a great start in the eyes of the american consumer   taurus had been the number   selling vehicle in the united states for   years   and customers loved it s pre   euro   body shape that was very very slippery and fuel efficient   but sad to say has lost site of the target the american consumer s love of driving and appeal for performance and speed in a vehicle   i must admit   i own a   taurus s h o   and in my biased opinion   should have continued along this line of thought   a family sedan that drives like a sports car   the   taurus s h o was a collaboration between and yamaha motors that met the theme it drove and looked like a family sedan   but had all the excitement and and appeal of a fuel efficient sports car   i still own the   s h o   and still fully enjoy driving it   by the way this article was written by a single man   with no children   i pray that and yamaha motors will reunite for one more encore   s h o   the newer taurus lacks passion in the driving and performance departments br br  
522,0,   it simply amazes   me that the taurus is still in production   after many years of major transmission   engine   and general quality control complaints one would have thought this car would have landed itself in an early grave   unlike many other cars that had caused their owners so much anger and grief   do to poor reliability   quality control   and lack of dealer support   i e the hyundai excel   the taurus somehow made it past all those thousands of unhappy customers and is still being sold for the   year with the claim that it is   one of the best selling cars in america b for the   model year   the taurus sedan comes available in a multitude of trim lines that include the base lx   the se   ses   tester   and sel   the wagon is offered in se and sel trim    powerplants are also available   all trims besides the sel come standard with the reliable yet anemic ohv    vulcan v   while a dohc duratec    v is standard on the sel and is an option on the lesser trim lines   transmissions include a standard   clunky   unrefined    speed automatic i driving impressions i   my tester   taurus ses deluxe   had the optional    dohc duratec engine   almost a    option   at one point in time     i was impressed with this engine   but alas other companies have moved ahead with technology and for   this engine just seems like it s lagging in the refinement department   off the line   acceleration   with the duratec v is fair   but the dohc duratec seems lackadaisical compared to the    v in the   accord and totally anemic compared to the   a href content      v in the nissan altima a   on take off the duratec almost strains to get this   lb vehicle up to speed   don t get me wrong   the car is not slow by any means   it just has to work much harder to get up to speed than the competition   the   speed fully automatic transmission coupled to this engine only makes accelerating problems worse   the transmission   while loads refined over the axod tranny equipped in the    tauruses still lacks the precise shifting associated with cars like the camry or even the chevy impala   clunky automatic shifting between st gear and nd is still noticeable   and shifting too soon   high gear around   mph is still annoying   as the car has virtually no power at this speed in high gear   so automatic down shifting and up shifting while driving through town is almost inevitable if you don t manually take it out of overdrive    handling   in the   taurus is good   however like most family cars on the twistys   this car tends to lean which can be quite prevalent around bends at high speeds   the   taurus ses is not a bad handler for what it is   but like the powertrain   most of the competition has the edge in this department as well    cruising   in this relatively large family sedan is not exactly another downfall for the taurus ses but it s also not an attribute worth boasting about   when cruising at    mph wind and engine noise can be heard in the cabin   but for the first time while in a taurus it did not bother me   with the older generation   wind and engine noise would get very annoying   and while it still can get annoying when accelerating under full throttle   the   tauruses are nowhere near as noisy   at least not with the duratec engine   since it s redesign in    the taurus seems to take bumps much easier   and rattles are kept to a minimum   jolts are also much easier on the spine   i can remember driving the    tauruses and not believing how many rattles and unexpected jolts would be present on bumpy surfaces   there is a major improvement vs   the last generation in this dept   hills are taken well   surprisingly the duratec v enables this heavy weight to tackle up to    grades without having to automatically down shift to maintain   mph   and can even gain speed up these sorts of inclines if given good   right foot power   again without the need for the automatic to down shift    braking   in the   taurus ses deluxe is average good   despite this car having the infamous front disc   rear drum set up   it has standard   wheel abs which help assure good   safe stops   i was somewhat impressed with braking   however i still feel that with the price of the   taurus ses deluxe    wheel discs with abs should be standard equipment   even with the tall gearing   fuel economy   is only average   the epa is    which is lower than the larger   less sophisticated    ohv engined impala    fuel economy   gov   has more info on epa ratings i interior accommodation i   the   interior   of the   taurus ses is a mixed bag   while the car possesses many strong attributes   this car also has its obvious weak points   the interior vs its recent predecessor s is much more desirable   yet still remains cheap looking and the materials are still not up to par   for example   the dash seems dated   cluttered   and uninteresting   the instrument cluster is relatively small   but offers all the gauges you could want   tachometer   temp gauge   etc   etc   are added for driver convenience and are very easy to read while driving   some noteworthy   options   on the deluxe ses include   ac    disc in dash cd player   adjustable pedals   these adjustable pedals may sound cool in theory   but i feel should have saved the money and used it on the poor quality leather seating     cars has more info on all equipment that can be had with the ses deluxe trim   standard amenities include your basic family bag   dual air bags    cup holders   remote keyless entry   power everything   and cruise control   all amenities can boast that they are ergonomically friendly   however the stereo system is very cluttered   much like the systems in the volvo line up   this system also falls short in the clarity department   and received terrible fm reception while driving through local mountain valleys   seating is average   yet again falls short of the competition   my ses tester was equipped with optional front bucket   plastic feeling   leather seats with a   floor auto shifter   and console betwixt the driver and passenger   these seats offer good support and standard   way power adjustments   but due to the cheap feel they really put a hamper on certain aspects of my driving experience with this car   wearing a t shirt and the outside temp being   degrees   yes that s all it gets here during the day   my arms felt like they were resting on ice cubes while first trying to get comfy in these pleather seats   the quality of the leather actually reminded me of the poor leather seating in my   a href content     mercury sable a   the rear seats are made of the same cheap material   which offers a    split configuration   like all tauruses room remains very good   front and rear passengers will enjoy more than enough room for long trips   storage is also good   tons of room for a family of s   weeks worth of groceries   there are also many storage compartments throughout the cabin i exterior innovation i   the   exterior   of the   taurus   while once looking like what many thought looked like a jelly bean back in     than a space ship in     has now joined the world of plain jane automotive design   there are large see through effect head lamps   and angled tail lamps   but this car still looks like every car you see on the hertz rental car lot   the     spoke alloy rims   and optional spoiler do add some sport to this sedan   but still looks every bit the part of a car that was made to get lost in traffic   the loss of the dual exhaust system on the duratec equipped models just makes it that much harder for this car to look sporty    price   reliability     warranty i   with the   model year coming to a close i m sure there are rebates out there on these cars   however my tester had none   and was priced at a whopping     without taxes   reliability with the taurus has almost always been poor   i always hear from taurus owners that their new car has had no problems   but after   years they are in the shop getting a new transmission   this has been the norm for these cars for some years now   and i am now getting complaints that the    models are having reliability problems   not sure if fixed any of these problems   but if this car is a   must   on your shopping list   and you can afford it   i would ask for an extended warranty   as only offers a   year    mile warranty with roadside assistance    other cars to consider in random order b i    toyota camry    kia optima   a href content   epinions content   a    my review

523,0,  one of newton s laws of motion states   paraphrased   that a body in motion tends to remain in motion   the principle under discussion is commonly known as inertia   inertia   we all know   is not merely a physical phenomenon   it s also a phenomenon that exerts influence over such varied arenas as the stock market and personal relationships    how many couples do you know   for instance   that stay together far too long because the act of breaking up takes too much energy   inertia occurs in the marketplace   of that we can be certain   one of the most telling forms of inertia is a consumer s attachment to a brand or to a model   such devotion asserts itself in an   it done me right the last time   so i ll stick by it the next time   attitude   a sort of tammy wynette   model for consumption   we often sense inertia here at epinions   especially in the automotive category   where hardly a day goes by that i don t read a review stating that   i have always bought    insert car maker i   cars   in fact   automobiles may be the only consumer product in which inertia is an inherited force   hardly a day goes by in which i don t read a review that says    my   family   has always bought   insert car maker   cars perhaps i grew up in an unusual family   my parents drove pontiacs   fords   chevvies   dodges   chryslers   oldsmobiles   studebakers   ramblers   you name it   they drove it some time in the fifties   sixties   or seventies   and so i never developed that somewhat slavish brand loyalty    and   i venture   the condition best described by the observation that   love is blind   but i know that there are a lot of blind consumers out there b america s most popular car b advertisements tell us that the taurus is america s most popular car   note   however   that you can always tell when an advertising man is lying because his lips are moving   what   is   true is that the taurus is   one   of the most popular cars ever sold in this country   and   if you lump mercury sable in with the taurus   there are as many of them on the road as there are of any other vehicle   more importantly   the taurus    an ugly   melted looking critter at its birth    marked s re emergence as a power in the mid sized car market after more than a decade of shoddy quality   ill advised experimentation   and simple ignorance of consumer trends   finally   america was making a car that was competitive against japanese imports   so much so that it actually began making inroads into that import market   hooray for american ingenuity and engineering as such   the taurus developed a near cult following   giving a new generation a vehicle on which to lavish the family s addiction   suddenly if you ached to drive a stylish   dependable car   you didn t have to hide the toyota from dad or watch uncle stan sneer at the honda   and so the taurus   and its   name plate twin   the mercury sable   became s   comeback kid   three cheers for henry   edsel   and the rest of the fords b fast forward to    over the years   i ve driven lots of tauruses   tauri   always as a rental   i ve driven them through snow   in the baking desert sun   at the beach   and on winding mountain roads   while i ve never been tempted to buy a taurus   frankly   it s larger than i need   i ve never been unimpressed by the car   either   this is a vehicle that s always seemed to be a solid   dependable    if somewhat boring    performer   but then i d never reviewed one for epinions   either   so here s my chance   after having looked at a   taurus with a critical eye b the car   my ever faithful suppliers at enterprise rented me a   taurus se model   a four door   with the stock v vulcan engine and a four speed automatic transmission   this particular model has a   convertible   front seat   which is a bench seat with a center panel that unfolds into a console and or armrest to create the illusion of bucket seats   the vehicle came equipped with dual airbags   power doors windows mirrors   cloth seats   am fm cassette   tilt wheel   cruise control   intermittent wipers   styled aluminum wheels   and ac   i picked it up with about   miles on the clock   i turned it back in with just over     five days and    miles   about   miles were highway driving   the rest on city streets and freeways in the austin and houston areas   weather was mostly dry   though my return to austin encountered some moderate showers b styling notes   for those interested in such things   the vehicle was a metallic charcoal gray with a multi shade gray interior   that particular combination is apparently quite popular   one night in my hotel parking garage i had to choose among the taurus   a   and a contour all in that color combination   i stayed with the taurus   cause i didn t have keys for the this model was restyled by with the   model year   speaking from memory   earlier models were far more dependent upon the oval motif   and still retained some of the original version s melted external contours   the restyling possesses slightly more angularity than the old version   with sharper slope breaks at the base of the rear window and on the trunk line   the interior has much of the   chunky   look adopted by many automakers in the latest   s and early s   blocks of foam filled   naugahyde   tend to fight for supremacy with contoured plastic panels in the dash and on the doors   the seating arrangements do not appear to have changed from earlier models   and the instrument panel and dashboard layouts are little changed   if at all b driver car interface   the taurus handles moderately well for a mid sized family sedan   cornering is responsive with neither crispness nor poor control   the driver has a good connection to the road when compared to larger vehicles such as the lincoln continental   but is more isolated than when driving most japanese sedans   mitsubishi galant   toyota camry   braking tends to feel a bit mushy at highway speeds   the stock   hp vulcan v possesses adequate reserve power at highway speeds   but is noticeably weak on acceleration from a standing start   this is the least powerful of three available v engines   i averaged about    mpg with this engine   note   mostly highway driving   the four speed overdrive transmission shifts smoothly and responsively for the most part   in this model   the shifter is mounted to the steering column the cockpit is laid out comfortably   with most controls easily accessible and few   if any   surprises   the intermittent wipers and headlight dimmer switch are located on the turn signal stalk   the cruise control buttons are on the face of the steering wheel   on off on the left and accelerate coast resume on the right b driving environment   the driver s seat in this configuration has a seat back tilt adjustment and forward backward adjustment   both manual   there is no lumbar adjustment   driver seating is relatively comfortable   though the lack of lumbar support is somewhat bothersome   rear seat entry in the four door models is a piece of cake   and rear seat room is average or above for vehicles of this class   there are sturdy anchor points for two child car seats on the car s rear deck there is a single small   rather strangely shaped glove compartment and the ubiquitous door side map pockets   provides a single cubby in the dashboard for front seat passengers   rear seat passengers have pockets on the seatbacks suitable for stowing a magazine and little else   there are two power ports   both in front   one doubles as a cigarette lighter   the rearseat passengers have two flip out cupholders   front seat passengers have two cupholders molded into the underside of the fold up seatbottom   this latter surface also has minimal storage for cassettes and a few coins   it dumps its contents when inverted   no surprise there   to form a seat cushion   the only locking space in the cabin is the glove compartment   note   that when the seat is in   bench   configuration   there are no cup holders and little storage   probably moot   anyway   since the room would be rather limited the trunk is a capacious   cubic feet   although the sill is quite high   making loading cumbersome for shorter drivers and passengers   the circumference is notched for a cargo net   though there was none in the rental vehicle   it may be standard and have   disappeared   the lid opens with a key or a dash mounted remote   and there is also an emergency latch for opening from the inside   the rear seats do not fold down   nor is there any sort of   pass through   for carrying long cargo   a disappointing lack of a feature available in other trim lines and on competing models engine noise is somewhat intrusive   partially because this particular engine seems to be rather   grumbly   road noise is minimal unless the road surface is coarse   but wind noise is also rather pronounced b highs and lows   these are my personal observations about this taurus model   with additional explanation where necessary i positives   the accelerator pedal    good rear seat room   large trunk capacity   good climate control   clear dash and instrument panel layout   fuel economy i mmmmm   maybe   the neutral zone    engine acceleration   road handling and braking   an average climate control system   road noise and wind noise i negatives   the brake pedal    no fold down rear seat   amateurish looking design to interior components   especially the   console   engine noise   a disturbing metallic rumble at idle   cheesy stock sound system   poor quality control   see below   that stupid front seat console and lack of interior storage b on quality   one of the reasons many us buyers deserted american carmakers in the seventies and early eighties was the perception of poor quality in us cars   if all american cars are as poorly made as this particular taurus   the exodus should begin anew   in only four day s exposure   i noted the following defects   the ignition key was hard to turn and more than once failed to release from the   start   position    this left the starter engaged until i manually released the key   at least one body seam had variable width along its length   a definite no no   one panel is therefore misaligned   there was a quarter of an inch of mismatch between interior panels on the back of the front seat   flashing   excess plastic from the molding process   had not been trimmed off the interior of the trunk   especially in the clips for the cargo net   the fuel gage would not rise above    even when filled b overall   appears to have decided to rest on its laurels with this vehicle   and has not done what is necessary to keep it competitive with the camry   accord   galant   impala   and the like   i suspect they re counting on brand loyalty     inertia     to keep the taurus selling while they expend all their energy on their suvs   not a good idea     not recommended   for unimaginative exterior styling   some truly stupid interior styling   poor quality   and average drivability   there are better cars on the road   let s buy   them   instead i tammy wynette   country western artist   perhaps most widely known for her counter feminist anthem   stand by your man i  
524,0,   maybe it s just me i but   my husband s white    taurus se   is bland   chintzy   and nothing to be proud of   the most redeeming quality of the vehicle is that it s his car and we aren t forced to shell out our hard earned cash for the not quite mediocre piece of crap with that said   i have nothing against or the taurus for that matter   but   the fact remains that the auto giant made very few   if any   improvements over the   se model   i   in fact   have a sneaking suspicion that the has gotten a bit too comfortable in the market and in the buying public   they have a built in audience that will buy a taurus regardless of higher quality and similarly priced competition   like my own lovely   impala ls    the exterior   from the outside   the    taurus se   looks pretty good   the style is a definite improvement over the late   s   spaceship look   it in fact is a combination of the more popular earlier and boxier taurus lines and the style popularized a few years back by creative japanese auto manufacturers   the side panels are relatively blah   while the back and front are slightly attractive   designers shouldn t be proud of their work on the car   redesigned initially for the   model year as with the   model   the vehicle has some issues with aerodynamics   the car should have been tested further in the wind tunnel   why   well   if you drive one and haven t yet noticed rode grime and mud collects in strategic locations toward the back bumper   it s not a major issue when you re driving but goes to show that the body isn t perfectly designed    the interior   upon sitting down in the bland medium gray interior   the first thing that struck me was that it looks and feels cheaply made   considering the fact that the car retails for over   k   this isn t a good thing   there are strange metallic decorations   a badly contoured dash   and not in the least bit attractive console   fortunately for   the console is nicely arranged and can be accessed easily by the driver   it s roomy enough for a mid size vehicle   though the seats aren t nearly as comfortable as some other similar vehicles the already uncomfortable seats have no features to speak of   you can tilt the back and push the seat forward or backward   aside from that   the    taurus se   lacks lumbar support and any of the other perks that are sometimes available   the passenger seat is similar while the back bench is a bit cramped and not particularly comfortable for riders   it would be good for small children   but by the time kids become teens the seat might be a bit too small with an adequate   square foot trunk   there is plenty of room in the taurus   the trunk is rather thick   though is lacking when it comes to deepness   extending toward the rear seats   the rear seats are fixed and can not be folded down in any way to allow for added capacity   this is a major flaw in the design the se model we have came with a cd player with average speakers and no real bonuses   there isn t anything special to speak of about the temperature controls aside from saying    yes   there is in fact air conditioning   one minor complaint i have is that the visors are cheaply made and the back side mirrors lack lights   if memory serves   i do believe that the   taurus se at least featured that luxury   other standard features include power windows   mirrors   and brakes and keyless entry   just don t expect any good surprises   this is a pretty stripped down car b the driving experience   i will admit that i m jaded because of the   chevy impala ls   that car has a lot of energy   pick up   and is easy to drive   the    taurus se   on the other hand feels like a dog   the usually adequate v vulcan with   horsepower engine is slow to accelerate   the automatic shifting at times has problems between st and nd gears adding to the already problematic driving experience once you get up to speed   the car functions decently   though not perfectly   passing is a laborious process   what i can say is at least the brakes work well on both highways and city roads   the steering wheel mounted cruise control is easy to use and functions pretty well   just a tiny tap of the brakes and the cruise immediately shuts off so far as gas mileage   expect to get an average of just over   miles per gallon   despite s claims of higher   as compared to my impala   with a much larger engine   that s not too good   that larger vehicle gets about   miles to the gallon on average   the taurus   smallish engine should in reality be more efficient   so   basically   you get a low energy car with iffy gas mileage   is this car sounding good to you yet   i hope not b final assessment   when compared to the earlier style model   the    taurus se   looks nicer from the outside though it took a big step back with the interior   at well over     for this car   it s not a good buy   i would recommend buyers look elsewhere to the aforementioned chevy impala   the honda accord   the toyota camry   and even the chevy malibu before settling on the taurus   it really is a disappointing vehicle b specifications     liter   v vulcan

525,0,  having driven taurus   frequently from rental companies over the years   i have come to a love hate relationship   now i have one of my own and nothing has changed this taurus was not my choice    it is a car which i use    of the time   for both business and personal use   is slowly improving the style   particularly phasing out the oval shape of just about everything   the elimination of the oval shaped back window and the hardening of some of the exterior flow lines towards the rear of the car have helped its looks greatly this taurus has a fairly smooth ride and a good grip on the road   steering control is fairly tight steering range is another story   i have never before had to back up and try again to navigate tight spots as much as i have to with this car   you get used to how far a wheel should turn on most cars    this doesn t even come close inside   they have made attempts at comfort   though they miss the mark   the power driver s seat option is great and adjusts well   having that also allows you to get the optional adjustable pedals   i love it   you will never again have leg cramps on long trips or find yourself adjusting your legs because the pedals are too far away or to close   this is particularly helpful for someone under about    even with this comfort   your ride will be uncomfortable because the seats are cheaply done   they have little contour or padding to them   for someone who spends a lot of time in a car i would think twice here   the sun visors are cheaply done as well   they feel like painted cardboard   and are just about as thick   no luxuries like illuminated mirrors or extension for side facing sun   the interior is roomy   however   if you opt for the six passenger seating you will even find the middle seat up front to have good leg room one poor design is the armrest center console on the six passenger seating   folded up for the sixth passenger everything is fine    except that there are no cup holders available to you   you can then unfold and open the armrest to expose the cupholders and the console storage area   while a second piece becomes the armrest   the major problem here is that there is no cover to the storage area   anything you keep here    including coins in the coin holder    is in plain sight until you again fold everything up    leaving you with no cup holders again the cd player and stereo seem to work well   although cd and a cassette combination are not available   it also has a theft   remote lock and entry system so far   nothing has changed    i still have that love hate relationship with the taurus  
526,0,  i was given this car as a vehicle when i first arrived in the us   months ago   my first thought on seeing it was   what an ugly heap   i was more impressed by the luggage space as it fairly easily swallowed all of the stuff a family of   carry when travelling to a new land driving from the airport to the hotel i was immediately struck by how soft the seats were   almost sofa like in comfort if you only travel for a few miles   problem is that for longer journeys they are completely lacking in support and i was in agony after only   miles or so next nuisance item was the multifunction stalk for controlling lights   wipers etc   really   these functions should be seperated but the use of a column gear change prevents that   these column mounted gear stalks are very quaint   but personally if i never see one again it will be too soon performance was   well how could i put this without cussing   absolutely useless   that thing couldn t pull the skin off a rice pudding   it is flatter than roadkill and only slightly more attractive   i don t know its top speed as i never felt sufficiently in control to test it   it felt like it would have trouble outrunning a moped but i never had the courage to try it brakes are adequate without being startling   i did find that parking brake to be hopeless   anybody living in a hilly area is going to become rapidly hacked off with not having a normal handbrake rather than the stupid foot operated system   it is impossible to gradually release a foot system so making fully controllable getaways a distant dream handling   handling   nope   not on this thing   this is the sort of softly suspended barge on wheels american cars used to be like   this might have been acceptable in    but things have moved on a long way since then   my last   cars were   saabs and an audi a so perhaps criticising the handling is a little unfair   problem is that s offering in this category in europe is the mondeo and it kicks bottom   now that is a car they should be offering to the american public   rather than the shoddy heap of garbage that is the taurus  
527,0,  well lets get right to the point i was a big owner of taurus   i have own practicly all models except this one   taurus has always been on the cutting edge for technology and power over most manufactures cars that are comparable to the taurus   one of the main reasons why taurus made it into the nascar races because taurus was building a name for themselves of making powerfull cars   in   taurus came out with their ultimate car which was the   liter v sho taurus folks let me tell you if you ever get a chance to ride in a    liter v sho taurus do so because the minute that person lays his foot on the pedal your jaw will be in the back seat   why am i bringing this up because this is all important do to the fact how taurus has progressed into a awesome car   that i kept buying because each year they kept getting better and better   then all sudden the ovals came out and a smaller taurus   then next was the smaller engine   when i ask the manufacture if they have more engine packages he said no    is it   come on   so i forgave them and look into the interior i wasn t impress it was nt up to par with the typical norm of taurus in the pass   it was cheap material   the hole dash board layout is totaly illogical   it came with a cassete deck has default and no cd player   i m sorry but cassete deck built into the dash   cassete deck should nt even exist anymore in the car   i praticlly laughed my head off when i saw this   most still be living in the   s   most foreign cars if not all come standard deafualt with a cd player built into the dash   cassete then becomes optional and that s how it should be   air climate control totally sucks should be digital and temperature driven by degress   they moved the unlock and lock on the up part of the door and not down where the fingers would normally be   who in the world came up with that idea they must have been smokin somethin   the spedometer totally sucks also you ca nt tell what the heck speed your doing   theirs more lines and dashes then their are actuall speed listings so you have to study the damn dash to figure out what speed you are doing   the console cup holders are nt big enough   the sterring on the car seems like it has a huge understeer to it   it almost seems like you have to turn the wheel around   times just to get it to do a square corner   on the passanger side their is abosultey no place for you to lay you feet down flat   when you sit down your feet are always propt up on something   and of course i could go on with the list   the only good thing it has going for itself is the fact that it has a smooth ride   and that s it   o and the trunk size is decent   that s it   o just though of another bad the sound system in the car is terriable its really tinney sounding and the radio stations sound really far away when their not   has ruined the taurus and this model i will not buy   it breaks me heart to say this but i will probably not by another taurus until i see improvement   i will be heading over to the toyota series of cars now   because it seems like the foreigns have more innovation and techonolgy in their cars now   is still living in the   s   and i do beleive when they came up with the ideas for this new series of taurus that they must have been smoken something for sure  
528,0,  you d never see me buy one of those but i drove enough in a rental car to make myself a good opinion quite silent at highway speed except for tire noise   handling is not too bad and healthy   body roll is contained   brakes are strong enough in spite of the absence of rear discs seats have absolutely no lateral support   which makes driving on twisty roads a real pain auto gearbox th gear is way too long   engine lacks torque to hold it unless road is flat   steering mounted gear lever is clumsy although it saves space for stuff between the seats   upshifts are okay although not without hesitations at low speeds   but downshifts are slow build quality is really average to low   i had the steering lock mechanism coming out inadvertently   plastics quality and assy leaves to be desired   we are far   far away from audi league  
529,0,   e   econoline   conversion by d elegant    i    eod       aftermarket interior and exterior     gvwr   aftermarket rear heat and a c background i have owned and driven vans since i was   years old   i started out with a   e   with   cid i    i have owned vans with almost every engine available in them   i have used vans for solo commuting   recreation   hauling band members and band equipment   hauling merchandise for distribution   hauling frieght in the   quot just in time quot   expedited frieght business   hauling students   and now pulling my    travel trailer currently i own a    e   clubwagon chateau    v    eod      differential formerly the topic of this review   i owned a    e   econoline conversion van   conversion by d elegant   the front suspension on this van was bad from the day i bought it with    miles   it was back at the selling dealer about   times within the first month   and then other dealers and alignment shops thereafter   the last alignment that i had done was at a reputable truck spring shop   they told me that the front coil springs were almost worn out   because of the aged springs   they had to change the bushings on the ball joints to the maximum angle to align the van   they stated the condition of the springs and bushings on their invoice and stated that the next time it is aligned   it will need to have the front coil springs replaced before they will align it   i know that this shop is reliable and trustworthy   but what about the selling dealer   i had the salesman write in the sales agreement that the van would be properly aligned before i took possession of it   well   i found out that it was never on an alignment rack before i took possession of it   after the sale   the service department at mccandless in mercer pa gave me nothing but lip service about aligning it   they even sent me out on the road with the technician so that i could approve the work   well it felt good on the   lane road that we drove it on   but it pulled when i drove it home on the interstate   that is when i made the appointment at the spring shop to take a look at it   i think that had a problem with the e   chassis in    and nobody told me about it the   i   engine was very economical   i normally got    mpg hwy   but it dropped drastically to   mpg pulling the trailer   a quiet engine   good torque   but no power to pull our    travel trailer up hills and keep up our speed   there was no room for acceleration when pulling the trailer the eod transmission didn t do to much hunting   however   i stopped the hunting by locking out od when it would downshift the first time   i would then ride out the hill in rd or nd the     differential gave me no problems the conversion is d elegant   the short comings that i found with the d elegant conversion is the bay windows by creation   seating by dygert   sub of flexsteel now   and the aftermarket rear heat and a c   i experienced the wind whistling in one of my bay windows   i found the rear chairs to have seats as hard as rocks   and i found the after market air to be really weak as far as the blower and the freon   there is more to a vehicle than a pretty looking interior and exterior paint job this e   had a tow rating of    and i bought a travel trailer with a   gvwr   the   i   in stock condition would pull the trailer well if my speed was under highway speed   however on the highway   i could not ever maintain the speed limit if i were pulling any degree of upward grade   in fact   i was often locked out of od to pull grades and even sometimes in nd gear to pull big hills   while the e   was good for economy   it was not a good camper toter i would recommend the drive train to anyone wanting a dependable truck engine   who is going to use it at lower speeds   i would not recommend it to anybody who is doing alot of highway travelling   i would not recommend any conversion van to anybody because the parts that the converters use i replaced this    e   with a    e    in the deal i got oem quad seats    way power driver s seat with lumbar support   oem rear heat and air   oem windows   heavier front coil springs   heavier tires   heavier rear suspension   i am very pleased with my trade br br  
530,0,  we purchased the   explorer wd xlt sport utility vehicle   suv   back in august of    we previously owned a gt   and a camaro z    yeah   huge change   the reason we chose this suv is because we were able to get the dealer to come off the price   and we needed an suv or   family car   before the birth of my second child   since our purchase we are extremely disappointed and unhappy with our explorer   don t get me wrong we enjoy the spacious seating   and all the options   but   the all around product is very low quality for the big bucks you pay engine options for our model included    liter   hp v   which feels like very little power when starting out   for highway driving it handles okay   but has a lot of wobble feeling on the inside and you hear a lot of road noise   our car is wedge wood blue with light gray interior   the body is extremely durable   we have had a very minor   mph   fender bender and it done no damage to our rear bumper   but pealed off the paint and dented the other cars front bumper   the interior is really easy to maintain   we have two toddlers and you could imagine our fears with having the light interior   but i am proud to say that there has not been one spot that we couldn t get out   after about   months of owning this suv we started having a weird problem with the windshield wipers   for some unknown reason while driving down the road the windshield wiper would suddenly turn on by itself and swipe the window about   times and then stop   we had one incident were they would not work at all   very scary   we of course took them in to get fixed along with another strange mechanical defect   the check engine soon light would always stay on   they fixed the windshield wiper   and said that a sensor went out causing the engine light to stay on   so they fixed that   shortly after this day   we received a recall on the wipers during the next summer of owning this suv we had a few incidents were the suv wouldn t go in reverse with out putting it in drive first    not good when in tight places   p   the only happened a few times   and we called the dealer about it but said that they couldn t duplicate the problem unless it happened while they were looking at it   well needless to say we never took it in because it stopped   but   it still bothers us our latest problem with this really loud high pitched whining sound that comes from the under side   but only happen while driving under   mph   and when its cold   well   we took it into the shop   yesterday to be exact   and the darn thing wasn t doing it so they did nothing for us   but   what do you know it started doing it again that same night grrrrr i know that all cars are not    perfect   and that these problems are minor   but the latest deaths   and tire recall   as well as the big fears of the suv rollovers    the one suv that seems to be involved in most of the rollovers   is the explorer   these recent facts have brought my husband and i to the decision of trading in our explorer for door car   if anyone asks me in the future what i think of the explorer i would say exactly what i have here   i would most definitely not recommend it to anyone br br  
531,0,  entering this vehicle without a key is easy   on some models   keyless entry systems are in use   this consists of a number pad on the driver door   the owner simply punches a combination to enter the vehicle    quot what s so bad about that quot   you say   well the problem is this   if the correct combination is entered by itself or within any string of numbers   the door unlocks   a thief could find one of these vehicles in a dark parking lot and just sit next to it and punch random numbers untill the door opens   there is no time delay   and no maximum number of tries   i tried this myself   and was able to enter the vehicle after about   minutes of random number punching   also   a permanant   quot backup quot   code is in the system in case you forget your personal code   this cuts the time it takes to punch the correct random number considerably   i would strongly caution anyone buying this vehicle to inquire with the car dealer as to whether or not this problem has been fixed on new models   as for those who already own one   i would consider disabling the keyless entry system br br  
532,0,  i rented a explorer   for   days and was unimpressed   this was an   cylinder and had less than k miles on it   the gas mileage must have been around     the first thing i noticed in the rental parking lot was the firestone tires on the vehicle   the car seemed stiff to me in handling   the steering is tight and any small movement will cause the car to pull appreciably   so   it is easy to see how one could turn one of these over with a sudden yank on the steering wheel the interior was nicely designed   but the leg room was inadequate   i am only    quot   and found that i could not put the seat back far enough for my comfort   also   i found that after a while   the seat felt uncomfortable   there were four different buttons for seat positioning   but two seemed to have the same function the interior was great for cargo space but there seemed to be even less leg room for the back seat area   this vehicle was hard to get in and out of because of the wheel height   even using the running board   it was not easy to get into   i had to pull myself up into it the visibility is good since you are sitting higher than most other vehicles on the road   there are many settings and features on the radio and this one came with a very good quality cd player   the quality of the sound was good the locking mechanism was on a fob key holder and it worked well   although i thought that they could have increased the sound to better hear the locking mechanisms for safety sake the power was okay    this one was an   cylinder    not impressive and not a real powerhouse   despite the mileage   or lack thereof i doubt that i would ever own one of these explorers   i currently own a jeep grand cherokee and have been a jeep owner for over ten years   so   perhaps my bias is showing br br  
533,0,  i test drove and was about to buy this vehicle   it is large and roomy   but somehow even on the luxury model it doesn t feel luxury   it has a very basic feel to it   after test driving this vehicle i looked this vehicle up in the consumers report   this car rated fairly well   but not great and for the price it should be great   the toyota   runner is about the same price and is of amazing quality and reliability   a friend of mine is a account executive for a large pharmaceutical corporation that purchased a fleet of explorers for their account exec s   she also had just owned a   runner   and she said that her car has not been that great and is not that reliable   she insisted that i not purchase the explorer   first hand experience is a very reliable resource for information i am not telling you to not purchase this vehicle   i am saying   quot do the research quot   it looks pretty   but if the maintenance and depreciation stinks   you re not getting that great of a deal   if you can buy another quality suv   even if it s a little bit more   but it s not in the shop all the time and it has good value when you go to sell it   you have made out shop wisely and good luck   p s   a little tip to save you money   unless you off road more than once or twice a year   buy the   x   and not the   x    the   x   costs several thousands more and raises your insurance rates   most people make the mistake of thinking that they have to have   x    you don t   you have truck handling and height for rough riding   a   x   is only really needed for off roading   soft sands   etc br br  
534,0,  i recently had the opportunity to drive a new   less than   month old   explorer xlt   i approached this car with an open mind   i d heard good things   from my mother   the owner of the car in question   as well as bad things    from those who didn t own one   a spring break where i was to be the sole driver of this car should have been the perfect chance to bond with the new car   right   wrong at first glance   i liked the explorer   the paint was nice   console was nice   leather on the seats was nice   room looked nice   when i stepped into the drivers seat for the first time   my good impression of the car began to fade   due to the make of the seats   in order to have the back at a correct position for driving   the   quot headrest quot    just a continuation of the seat   was so far back that i   seriously   had concerns about major whiplash in the event of a minor fender bender   despite trying different positions of the seat back   at no point could i get the headrest at a position in which to stop my neck from being whipped back in the littlest of accidents   the bottom of the seat was comfortable   however   which while a plus   didn t make up for the headrests i approached the explorer thinking of it as an suv   the front windshield would indicate otherwise   it s about the same size as the windshield on my prizm   the size of the windshield isn t a great problem   but a fairly large annoyance   because of the position of the console in reference to the roof   the rearview mirror is literally in the middle of the windshield   which makes viewing small items such as street signs difficult when in the correct position   i ve got to belive there is   some   design that could solve this problem   this car can not take bumps   it is astounding to me that a new explorer shakes so very much when going over the smallest of bumps   these are bumps that do not rattle any other suv s including the suburban and tahoe   when a    suburban takes the same bumps better than a brand new explorer   i just cringe when thinking about how it will be in   years   going down a fairly bumpy road   expect to have a horrible headache from your brain being rattled around in your skull   even at speeds as low as mph   i really do love going to the gas station daily   really   i do    especially when the snow is blowing horizontally in my face   suv s   while known as gas guzzlers   do have standards   the explorer has a     gallon tank   this is the same size as my boyfriends toyota supra   which   for those of you who don t know   is a smallish sports car   a   gallon tank wouldn t be so bad except when you factor in the mpg   in average city highway use   you get about   mpg if you re lucky   this is less than both the suburban and tahoe   for a car of this size to have such a small gas tank when the designers are aware of its low gas mileage   it s completely insane i tried to like the explorer   but in the end   i just couldn t   i belive my first words to my mother were   quot didn t you research this car before you bought it quot   i will be sticking to my original decision to buy a tahoe    the explorer xlt just isn t worth it     
535,0,  momma said that if you can t say anything nice   don t say anything at all   sorry     but i can t follow that adage when talking about my explorer   god rest his soul i bought my   explorer   xlt   wd   used right after i graduated high school in    with about k miles   i ran it up to k albeit   a high number   but not outside normal boundaries within   and a half years   and   might i add   not without signifigant problems   within those   months i replaced the transmission     two air conditioner compressors     and it needed a third toward the end   the radiator    patch   that didn t work   and the replacement was a chirstmas present   along with numerous minor repairs that only added to my frustration   electrical problems   faulty starters   leaky oil gauges that ruined some pants   etc   when it was running   i really enjoyed my explorer   the gas milage wasn t terrible for such a big suv   but still not too economical   which was only compounded with my other truck related expenses   i felt safe driving it   not too topheavy but quite sturdy due to its broad wheelbase   and had lots of fun piling up dozens of friends at a time for roadtrips   while the good outnumbers the bad   it doesn t really outweigh the bad   friends with jimmys or blazers never had the ammount of problems i did   i wouldn t reccoment an explorer to a friend   or even a despised enemy   it just didn t measure up to the expectations given to me by the suv craze   i m musch happier with my honda accord br br  
536,0,  i must say that when i leased my new explorer sport wd it was to replace my   explorer sport   i loved the   model   it was dependable   reliable and got me where i needed to be even in the worst weather   even on the beach it was super   when my lease expired and it was time for me to choose another vehicle   i went to the same dealer and traded the   for the   model   at first   i loved it   then came very minor things that went wrong that i didn t think should have been wrong with a brand new suv   the dealership fixed these things without problems but then came the firestone tire recall   i must say i would not recommend the explorer to anyone after this tire recall   it truly is not fair to be so down on and i realize that the tires were not known to be defective when they were installed on my vehicle   however   it was the way the recall was handled   or should i say mishandled   that turned me off to my suv   i was told my car was safe to drive   dependable and reliable   i was also told that even though my tires on this vehicle were defective   there was no need to worry and that i didn t need to replace them   if it made me feel better   they recommended i find the nearest firestone tire dealer   go there and have them replaced but that it was not necessary to do so   it was this mishandling of the incident that makes me hate this particular vehicle and i wouldn t recommend this vehicle to anyone   furthermore   i took the suv back to the dealership   told them i didn t have time to be calling running around looking for firestone tire dealers and that since this vehicle was under lease and i didn t own it and since i have been a loyal customer to this dealership for many years   i felt strongly it was their problem and they should replace the tires   i was told next that i should contact in michigan and take it up with them because the dealership had no intention of replacing these tires     
537,0,  when test driving a new explorer   it is easy to ask yourself why   how is this the most popular suv in recent years   what has it done to deserve this achievement the explorer was once new in hip   but has quickly become painstakingly dull   the car has not evolved   seriously   in the last five years   the looks used to be daring   no they are overdone   the explorer   drives more like a nightmare than a dream   the wheel jerks slowly   there is not desired glide effect here   the explorer s interior as well is uninteresting   the best new feature they ve come up with is the cd dial on the steering wheel   other than that the interior has somewhat of a cheap feel as the next millenium approaches it is time for to think of something new   the explorer will not cut it much longer   maybe a   edition of the bronco   will bring trusty suv lovers back into s open arms br br  
538,0,  who wants one   anybody   if you answered no   give yourself a pat   and you can stop reading here   if you said yes   give yer self a kick in the butt   this sour lemon of a vehicle   oh where do i even start   how about puttin   pistons through the roof   months after i got it   ok   i got a brand new engine   and since had no problems   till a year later   i the jackass kept it the lemon would not start one day   so   i bring it to     later   i get it back running like new    weeks later   it rains   lemon would not start   i bring it to     later   runs like new    different problem   yea right it ran good for about   month   then it rained   i bring it to     later   runs like new   next day   i went through a puddle   not a lake   not a deep puddle   a little puddle on the side of the road   it died   so   it sat in my driveway for almost a year   rusting away   explained to me many times   that each thing they did was a different part   and did not touch what they did last time   so   i had to pay all over again if you want to buy this truck   my suggestions are send a check for your purchase price add on another    for the repairs then just leave the truck at the lot so   it is not stuck in your driveway   
539,0,  we leased this vehicle for   years   we began our lease in late   just before our first son was born   thinking that it would be a great vehicle for kids   groceries   travel and all that first off it was an absolute pig on gas   put your foot on the pedal and watch the gas gauge go down down down   it had guts   great passing power but you sure needed to feed it lots the   doors feature was kind of lame too   i would have changed that out of everything that i found wrong with it   simply because getting a child in and out of a car seat is a real pain when you only have   doors   then of course there were all the mechanical problems   from the electric seats breaking malfunctioning all the time making access to the back seat even harder   to the   wheel drive kicking on and off without notice   if the heating or cooling system was on while idling at a stop light you would hear this strange   quot clicking noise quot   which always made me nervous   this truck kind of reminds me of windows   when it first came out it needed the bugs worked out before putting it on the market   and x it is not   i took my explorer sport onto a gravel road and down a somewhat steep and bumpy slope and i couldn t get back out without a lot of effort   my   toyota land cruiser makes the    explorer look like a sorry excuse of a x   that s for sure   and i could pretty much guarantee a flat tire each and every time i took it down a gravel road    flat tires in less that   years   i hear the tires on my truck have recently been recalled   so perhaps that had something to do with it the the paint began to peel off the front hood   the power windows would work some days and then not work the next    burnt out headlights umm should i go on who should buy this vehicle   a mechanic i don t recommend it   sure it looks good   and is fun to drive but who needs the headaches br br  
540,0,  i can remember when the explorers first came on the market and i vowed i would someday own one   i loved the looks of them   at the time though we had only one child and room was not a factor   we have had our explorer for almost   years and it wasn t the best choice of vehicles for us   we went from a pontiac minivan so the lack of room was definitely noticed   the kids never have enough room for their   quot stuff quot   and constantly fight over it   as far as driving an explorer   we needed a x because of our muddy roads and snow and it s rough riding   if you are wanting a leisurely drive i don t recommend the this vehicle   we have recently had some problems with it too   but it may be just our vehicle   it will not start on occasion and fortunately hasn t left me completely stranded   it will turn over but it sounds like it s out of gas   we took it in to get it checked but they can t figure it out   one minute it won t start and   minutes later it will       drives me crazy   in the are of comfort for me it s just not very appealing there either   i need room for my purse   and anything else i need for work and if i m the only one it s okay but get another adult in and there s just no room for us either i have to drive   miles one way to work every day so gas mileage is another factor   i only get around mpg   however   no matter what vehicle i choose i will be faced with this because i need a bigger vehicle that sits me up higher and has   x    overall   i don t   quot hate quot   my explorer   but now that i ve had one i ve satisfied my curiosity and will not own another for a main vehicle   we should have chosen the expedition     if you have children i wouldn t recommend this vehicle if you want any room at all   however for a single person or two person family it would be fine   it will seat   but adults struggle to sit comfortably in the back     
541,0,  i bought this car new in   to replace my nissan sx   i was looking for a vehicle that was both sporty   yet very roomy and capable enough to handle the winter s snow and ice   the ability to be a cargo hauler was required   the initial test drive   as well as the first   months were wonderful   the vehicle met all of my requirements   not to mention that i felt it was a great looking vehicle the problems started around month three   lasted for four years   and ended just two weeks ago when i sold that car   the minor stuff first   a major annoyance was the tight access to the rear seat   at first i thought i could live with it   but it soon became very annoying   that is really nothing to fault the explorer for   because   door vs    door is really a personal opinion   but some things are just downright ridiculous   in the four years i owned that car   i had the throttle body replaced six times   intake manifold gaskets replaced   various recalls    too numerous to list   and had multiple transmission and x problems   just before selling the car   my explorer started to make a loud   clunking   noise as the transmission dropped out of gear every time i stopped at a stop sign   equally amusing was the way it refused to go in reverse unless i first shifted into   park   and waited   or more seconds   on top of all that   the body was starting to rust in four different places the dealer serviced this car every   miles by the book   no matter what preventative measures i took    this car would break down   after   years i just learned to accept it   so   weeks after i made the last payment   i sold that car on the plus side   the front seats are relatively comfortable   the interior remained fairly squeek free   though in year three   the car developed a rattle coming from just behind the driver s side door   also   the power and torque that the engine develops is very impressive i can not recommend this car   it is a service nightmare   if for some reason you feel the need to take the plunge into this nightmare   spend as much as you can on an extended warranty   you will need it  
542,0,  this vehicle is as good a car as any but not the greatest   i have borrowed my fathers   explorer many times for long trips or lengthy city drives and for these purposes it is fine   it is roomy and comfortable inside   it offers a seperate set of controls for climate and music aside from the front seats set   he chose leather seats which i personally do not care for so much but it also has a range of adjustment buttons for the front seats which can be nice   there is a temperature gage and direction indicator near the rearview mirror   his has a   cd holder and a tape player and a large area in the back for storage and such   i think this vehicle though was built from the inside out   they either were too concerned about minor inner details or put them all there to cover up the real problems   it seems he has had so much little troubles here and there and he should nt really have any at all with as new as it is   when the air conditioning runs in the summer   when you are sitting at a light you can hear it running poorly with a repeated tick in it   i have personally never been able to figure out how to convince the cruise control to operate   a mysterious breakage of a handle near the driver seat occurred and blame was placed but never accepted   it seems to me that they forgot to screw all the bolts in this vehicle tightly enough and while you are dazed and fascinated by all the pretty gadgets on the inside   there is chaos going on outside it seems to me that he also had problems with the driver window or maybe it was the mph gage   when they went to fix it   they gave it back and it suddenly randomly began chanting that his door was ajar i think for the reputation of and the price and year of this explorer   he should have had another    years at least before little problems began appearing   that was not the case though   i would recommend if you are considering this vehicle   you may want to consider a few others as well   get any available review   reports and test that have been done to this vehicle br br  
543,0,  while the explorer may for some be a terrific vehicle   two years with mine has me wanting more for my money   first thing i noticed about it was how the rear view mirror reduces the visibility when trying to see objects in front and slightly to the right   the mirror creates more front blindspot than i have ever seen in a vehicle   definitely a safety oversight on s part   in addition   the power windows have failed twice in the first year   the front tires have worn irregularly due to parts not originally installed for front end adjustments that need to be added   and an exhaust manifold that leaks which creates a tapping sound   the manifold problem has been addressed three times with the service department and the problem still exists to some degree   the service of my explorer at the local dealer merced ca   has been extremely poor   they have on three occasions not completed the work as promised and left me without a vehicle   offering no loaner   add to this terrible gas mileage   and i m looking to unload mine   sad thing is   the retail value is a lot lower than your dealer will tell you     
544,0,  i was looking for the best sport utility on the market   and said they had the best   so i went to go look at it   i was pretty impressed for what i saw   when i sat down with the salesperson i couldn t believe all the options the explorer had   i told the salesperson i wanted power in the engine   but didn t want awd   they told my option was a new    ohc engine that had   hp compared to the v   that had hp   after all was said and done   i leased the vehicle for   years when i drove the explorer home i was very impressed   it had the power i wanted   and it drove like a car   well   this feeling was very short   after a couple of months i felt like i was sitting in the engine compartment   it was so noisy i couldn t hear myself think   on one cold day in november i went outside to start the truck and heard banging coming from under the hood   i couldn t imagine what it was   i drove over to the dealership to see what it was   and the service manager looked at it with two mechanics and still couldn t figure it out   they told me to leave the truck there so they could run some tests   after a week of tests and a recall notice they told me i needed a new cam and the upper portion of the engine the truck only had   miles on it   when i took the truck home it was still noisy in the interior but it drove well   the next year and a half had it s ups and downs   i returned to the dealership   more times to fix a bunch of problems   some of the problems were   the l s r door was getting stuck   it started to burn more fuel then it should have   and it had a whole bunch of recalls if your looking to by a used explorer make sure you look into the maintenance history   the truck itself is a good truck   but had alot of problems with the   s br br  
545,0,  regarding my   soon to be ex explorer   i can say very little positive about this vehicle   now that my daughter is away to college   i am finally allowing myself to purchase my mid life vehicle   probably a miata this explorer has been a nightmare from day one   besides being somewhat over priced   the repairs on this vehicle alone could have paid for the note for a year   with in my first year i had to have the front suspension re worked   and the brakes adjusted   times   always   it seems   not under the warranty   i do nt know if this was the dealers fault   or the vehicle   but even though there were very few miles put on   all repairs seemed to fall under the wear and tear clause of the warranty   in driving this vehicle   i found that cornering was somewhat clumsy   and i was continualy feeling like i would tip over   gas milage was what you would expect from a suv   it ran close to mpg   the carpet in the back pulled up from the edges   even though the biggest thing i would put back there were grocries or luggage there are many other suv s out there that i am sure are better   but i am tired of them   it is time for something fun     
546,0,  i bought my explorer xlt w   speed transmission new in    i was primarily interested in the vehicle for its roominess and its   wheel capabilities during the winter months   although i enjoyed the ride for the first few months   i quickly became disappointed with the gas mileage and at    miles i lost the clutch    and i only do highway driving   round trip commute worcester boston at   a and   p   i had not lost a clutch in a vehicle since my volkswagon days back in the   s   in addition   i am terribly disturbed by the cost of servicing the vehicle at dealerships labor costs have recently jumped to    hr   which is absurd   it now costs     every time i take the vehicle in to be serviced suffice it to say   my next vehicle will not be a explorer to continue this saga eight months and    miles later a second clutch has been reported   quot burned quot   out from normal use   my driving habits have not changed from the above   and now the dealership wants another    to replace this second clutch will not stand behind its product   so i am dumping this lemon into the laps of the dealership   i have been driving standard transmission vehicles for   years and never have i had to replace a clutch in any vehicle with less than    miles in it   is the worst vehicle experience of my life   they will no longer have my business br br  
547,0,  it seems as if is still in it s constant struggle to produce a quality automobile   my family and i purchased a   explorer used from a dealership   the explorer cost us roughly     and came with a leather interior and was almost totally loaded except for a sun or moon roof   when we bought the explorer she had already lived about    miles of her nasty   painful life   after about a month with no problems   the brakes started to give us trouble   then about a week later we realized another problem   you can only fit the little munchkins from the wizard of oz in the back seat   the cargo space however was very good   and if needed   the explorer can be used as a truck   all of these things are very trivial   compared to the typical problem with fords   that we encountered about   months ago   the transmission failed   however after this we were o k   the transmission failing once was not a problem   we got it fixed   and nobody got hurt   the true problem was   month after the transmission failed    miles since the st transmission failure   the transmission failed again   many of my friends drive explorers   and among the   or   that do   i have only seen   other case of transmission problems   and only   more cases of problems in general with the car   however   you can say why i must vent my dislike for the explorer   we now own a toyota   runner   and it performs great   it is an excellent car and anyone who likes can read an epinion i wrote on that   if you can pay the little extra bit of money for the   runner   then you will most likely save money in the long run   if you do however choose to buy an explorer   get a long term extended warranty   because you will need it   if anyone would like more info on these   cars   then you can e mail me at odoyell hotmail    
548,0,  i have owned a explorer sport for about two years   i love the ride and the extras but the engine leaves something to be desired i had this vehicle for about three months and the engine siezed up and had to be completely replaced what a disaster a friend of mine had the same excate suv and the same thing happened to him   sent him a letter and told him they were aware of the problems but as if yet there as never been a recall or an offer to exchange the engine before it leaves you stranded on some lonely road i still have this suv but refuse to drive it on trips because of the questionable reliability br br  
549,0,  i recently was in the market for a used   suv   i went to the dealer   to see what was in their used car stock   the salesman told me they had just received a   explorer on a trade   and he thought the car was in excellent shape   i took his word for it   and took the car out for a test drive   let me tell you   this car was from from good shape   it drove terribly   the steering was loose and out of control   the engine sounded like it was going to explode   and the acceleration and power were nowhere near what i expected them to be   i told the slaesman what i thought and walked out of the dealership   that testdrive indicated to me fords quality   and their desire not to have you pleased with your car   but to make a sale no matter what     
550,0,  i purchased two new escorts in    one   a manual transmission   for my daughter   the other   an automatic   for myself   the price   looks   sunrise red   handling   safety and comfort were perfect for us   they both are   door   hatchbacks with alloy wheels the driving has been smooth and comfortable   the escorts   operating cost has been minimal   i have not had any problem with the engine of my automatic   my daughter has had an overheat light that comes on and had to be repaired twice   the light was a false alarm and the car never overheated both of us have had problems with the vehicle speakers   one or more speaker had to be replaced in my daughter s vehicle   this was not too suprising since she was in her early   s when we first got the cars   my left front speaker fizzled last spring and needs to be replaced   my daughter had a speaker and radio on order which still hasn t come so she bought her own and replaced them this is the biggest problem we have had with the cars   parts covered under warranty are taken off taken out and put on order and we still don t have them   there was damaged plastic molding on the side of my car which needed to be replaced immediately   it took a couple of months to get the piece so it could be replaced both cars have had speakers on order since last spring   my daughter has played taxi to the city of minneapolis so her car has more than twice the mileage on it than mine does   they are still running well without major problems it is a good   quot kid car quot   the escort takes a lot and keeps on driving   a good solid car for a little economy which will pile up a lot of miles without repair     
551,0,  i bought my   escort in january   with    miles on it   i drove it with only minor problems until this last year   over the course of the last   years we regularly maintained it   changing the oil every    miles   the speedometer broke with around    miles   but was still under warranty   the ac went out on us in early    the cost to repair it was outrageous   but fortunately a mechanic asked if it was a dirty plug   connection   or something   which it was   so the problem was fixed for around    the interior is fairly comfortable   the cloth seats held up well   rear speakers stopped working after the second year   instrumentation is easy to read   however   the   check engine   and   check coolant   lights came on at random times and after numerous diagnostic tests at around    dollars a pop   we learned that they just like to do that   leg room is sufficient although we are fairly short people   both under     my husband always had to drive with a travel pillow behind his lower back on long trips   but i was fine   we definitely wanted to stretch after a few hours   the paint on the rear bumper is faded   gas mileage was fairly good    we got around   mpg on the highway   unless the ac was running and then that sucked it down much faster   if you have children   know that the ac does not reach the back   even though it s a smaller car   our baby was always bright red even with it going full blast   and while the ac is on   you will not be going over any mountains   we turned off the ac then because the car felt like it was straining we replaced the windshield twice    each   new tires twice which are not a standard size and so are much more expensive   between    and    each   and a new front and rear engine mount    now as to why i am writing this review   in july    the same month we paid the car off   it stopped in the middle of traffic while my husband was coming to the airport to get us   at    miles   regularly maintained   the car needs a new   the cost to purchase a used will run around      a new will cost      after speaking with several mechanics   dealers   etc   everyone has told us that the cost to repair the car is more than it is worth   yes   it is   we are now without transportation   with a toddler and one on the way   we did not expect to be in this situation for years based on the reputation of   but we are   no trade in value   no chance to sell it   no car   everyone says   that s so unusual   they don t normally do that   well   mine did   i would recommend staying away from escorts   replacing a at    miles is ridiculous   we will not be buying a again  
552,0,  we bought this car for price and fuel economy   as a nd car it is a reliable car that gets good gas mileage unfortunately   it is microscopic   the ride is unpleasant   it rattles like crazy uncomfortable seats   no features   and if it came into contact with anything larger than a basketball it would be smashed to bits   not a fun car to own   buy only if desperate you feel every pothole like you are being dragged over it face first   and it rides as high as a skateboard   the front seats are bearable   but the back seat is quite possibly the most unpleasant place on earth   it s acceleration is weak from its pitiful   l four   but it can nip in between cars and gets you where you need to go though i wouldn t take it on the highway at gunpoint   i could almost call it sporty if its top speed was higher than   mph   but all it is is a small hatchback   nothing more   go for a sedan   you probably shouldn t buy this under any conditions   its only plus is that it never needs repairs   but we never use it much   it has k on it   that s all   much more and i m certain there would be more problems   it s lack of power locks and windows is infuriating   i d more than trade the power seat belt for those what s more ironic is that this is the gl model   which by all rights should be better br br  
553,0,  i am not intimately familiar with the   series   beyond reading the corporate blurb graciously provided by   however   having observed   quot up close and personal quot   some of the driving done by   owners   as well as some proud   and   owners as well   i feel qualified to comment on one aspect of the vehicle that aspect would be the snappy   space age appearance of the front end   pickups   and fords in particular   used to take a perverse pride in being utilitarian and ugly   but those days are over   i can say this with complete certainty   as i have been privileged to have been able to catch many a close up view of the lights   grill design   general aero look   and ubiquitous emblem in my rear view mirror   usually while traveling at or slightly above the speed limit in the righthand lane   apparently   this vehicle imbues its operator with the notion that it is made to be driven in the manner of a semi   like   real close to your rear bumper   in the mistaken belief that such roadway bullying will cause me to speed up   pull over   or spontaneously combust   at night   this unseemly intimacy is generally accompanied by the use of high beams as well    i am working on a device that will refocus incoming light back onto the offending vehicle s radiator and boil it dry   my usual reaction to such foolishness is to ease off the gas a tad until we re both going about   mph slower   so as to get an even better view of that fabulous front end   and perhaps even sneak a peek at the smoke coming out of zippy the pinhead s ears   i m not ready to switch vehicles just yet   but it is a comfort to know that when the day arrives   i need but to tap the brakes to facilitate some timely financing for my next vehicle anyway   congratulations     for designing a front end that fills my mirror   and other too   i m sure   with a view of serious design thinking and implementation   i m not trying to leave chevy and pickup drivers out of this    they can certainly be irritating in their own way   but not with the panache of the   it may be found on the road dead   but ya got ta love the way it looks when it does br br  
554,0,  the f v longbed crewcab has a hidden problem that has documented   but does not freely inform the buyer that there is a problem with the rear drive line   in that due to its length it has the potential to vibrate at highway speeds due to the angle inwhich the drive line sits i found out the hard way by purchasing this     vehicle and dealing with the dealership run around   the vehicle was returned due to the fact that they said that the problem could not be fixed but that it would not damage the vehicle to drive it that way   that was all fine and dandy but when i asked them to put that in writing so that if that part failed they would fix it for as long as i owned the vehicle   to me that means that we re not willing to back up our product but have a nice day   the vehicle was givin back although it had a comfortable riding with plenty of room for the family as well as for hauling   excellent power and fuel mileage for this large of a vehicle   in all its a good looking truck that i would purchase again but only if they have fixed the potential problem with the drive line br br  
555,0,  i live in the houston area so seing a big truck driving down the road is nt anything special   but seing one of the new f s crusin down the road just leaves me at a loss for words   i love theese trucks   they are solid work horses that can handle just about anything you throw their way   we use them for pulling big th wheel car trailers to the race track and hauling our cattle trailers around   but they are more than just work horse   they are also beautiful   on the weekend it makes a perfect truck to take out on the town and with the crew cab their is room for plenty of people   when its at the track we get just as many compliments on it as we do our   second camaro     
556,0,  if you do daytime only driving   the escort is the car for you   in the two years of owning the car   we had the pleasure of installing four headlamps and two taillights   this became my husband s hobby   i am distressed that since we have sold our escort   my husband has no past time   he sits sullenly   looking at our non escort car   and he begs me to let him replace the working headlamps in that car   just for fun i m still trying to get my husband interested in parcheesi the car was easy to get in and out of   once you pushed the weatherstripping back into place   the car held four people comfortably and the back seat was roomy   the blue color we chose seemed to be very popular in the detroit area only a four year old s tricycle has less power than the escort   that is if dad is not pushing the vehicle from the back   the engine noise was loud enough to drown out the words from the rider s in the back seat   and there were so many shake   rattle   and rolls in the body   even the mechanic that worked on the car shrugged his shoulders   and gave up trying to find the cause driving this car is an enjoyable experience if it is the first car you have ever driven   and have nothing to compare it to i would recommend this car for the   quot little old lady quot   crowd that drives   miles to the store and back   every other friday   around noon   during the brightest light of the day anyone else takes the risk of needing a seeing eye car br br  
557,0,  being that i rented at least   of these babies makes me wonder has just totally and completely lost it beyond all measure   i don t even know where to start   lets go with exterior   exterior actually doesn t look to bad   i would even go as far to say that it actually looks sleek and somewhat sexy   the paint job is not very good though   i have already notice on many rental cars i have rented the paint starting to wear away in places   which can be scary if you want to purchase a taurus   the headlights and taillights are pretty good no complaints their   dashboard   it so obvious that the designing and quality stop right at the air conditioning vents   considering actually put a cd player in the car this time is quite surprising to me   finally they step out of the   s with the old cassette style   i found the radio controls and cd controls to be very confusing and on more then one occasions they have almost proved fatal while i was driving   just to change radio stations is difficult while driving   considering the fact alone that changing cd tracks in the car is close to impossible   theirs a button for everything on the dash   a button for bass a button for treble for fade well you get the point   with all these buttons its close to impossible to figure out while driving what button to press to change the radio station or change cd tracks   it becomes almost a point of aggravation you almost feel like ripping out the entire dash at times   anyway onto the drivers dash area   i find the dash board to be pretty lit at night with red glows etc   my major complaint is the fact you ca nt tell what speed your doing theirs more line and dashes then their are actually speed postings   so yet again another dangerous feature you will be studding the speedometer allot trying to figure out exactly what speed your going   moving on to the passenger side   the passenger side mystifies me totally   the passenger side dash sticks out like   inches more then the drivers side does   so the passenger will be pushing his seat back all the way just to get the maximum amount of leg room he can achieve in the passenger side   bad side is in return the backseat person behind the passenger will become very cramp and will run out of leg room   plus when your in the car this looks really stupid because the drivers seat is not equal to the passenger seat in anyway   it makes the interior look completely uneven when sitting in the car   also while where on the topic of passenger side dashboard we might as well bring up the fact that the passenger side dash is huge i mean my god its like something that came out of a horror movie or something the passenger side dash area literally takes up the entire passenger area   that includes the leg room area as well   what was thinking when they did this i don t know   electronics   abs   on some model   cd player   radio   driver information how many miles to e   average miles per gallon   how many miles done   driver and passenger side airbags   cd player quality is ok the speakers could be allot better and i do mean allot better   driver information is nothing new should have done this years ago   radio quality is good   it comes with a trunk remote entry and keyless remote entry   leg room i find overall leg room in the car to be very poor   infact the only seat that has the most leg room is the driver seat and that is no joke either   seat comfort all four seats are at first comfortable but after about and hour of sitting in them they provide very little support   so your thighs and your butt will start aching terrible trunk space the trunk space is actually pretty big and is probably the most major plus about this car   the trunk can hold two full size suit case one on top of each other and a travel suit case to the right of the full size suite cases and then it can hold some travel bins towards the front   it can hold a full size garment bag as well   so trunk space is deffintley good on this car quality and craftsmanship   what can i say the material is very cheap on all   i have rented the seats are already tearing in certain places   the whole car feels like its been put together by plastic   also the car always breaks down   all   i have rented one i had the air conditioner fan go out   the other i rented the engine believe it or not just gave out and the car only had    miles on it   i was just driving it down the road at mph and the all of sudden silence   i called aaa i told them it was a rental car   so they went ahead and picked me up and drove me to the nearest hertz and i ask the hertz if they could ever tell me what was wrong with the car   i was just curious the guy gave me his number and said call him up in about a week i did and he told me the shop quoted that the engine had completely been shot he and i were surprised considering the car only had    miles on it   he said the car was covered by warranty anyway   so i was off in another taurus   this one was going well until the cruise control decided to quit and not work anymore   i tried everything to get it to work again but it failed to work   so after i was finish with business i return the car told them the problem   so i had another business affair i had to go on so hertz yet again gave me another taurus i was like what problem does this car behold for me now   driving down the road i thought come on something got ta go wrong well a hour of driving went by and nothing happen   i was like men a taurus without a problem   well boy was i wrong   all of sudden when i went to do a lane change my blinkers weren t working nor was the wipers working either   this was not so good as because it look like up ahead it was going to rain   and i definitely need my blinker because i was coming into heavy traffic   so finally return the car to the original location and i finally stab another taurus   this one actually had no problems   expect that the engine kept making this knocking sound ever time i accelerated   which concerned me a great deal   but some how it actually survived the trip and the return to its location   personally i consider the reliability to be very poor   and should be very ashamed presenting a car like this to the general public   the car itself is ok at best if everything is working correctly   i don t know if i got a bad batch of taurus or what   but these taurus folks where cars with less then    miles on them   personally i be very scared to buy one of these suckers in fear of god knows what going to go wrong with it   maybe the breaks could fail that would be great   i wouldn t doubt it with the way the car was made   the ride and steering the ride is probably the big plus the rid is very smooth and very plush   the steering on the other hand is responsive but it always feels like it has a huge under steer which makes you feel like the car is going to lose it every time you take a steep turn   overall i believe that if you really have to buy a taurus buy one used and drive it around and hopefully the used one will have had all the quirks worn out before you finally get to it   i highly recommend that you don t buy this car   the   and   model taurus was taurus best year and that more then likely will be their last best year   i think should just scrape the taurus or outsource the taurus to somebody that can really make it a fine car   considering that lowered that engine models from    to    which makes the newer model taurus always seem under powered   is living in the past   i do believe needs to take a real hard look at the foreign cars and start implementing what the foreign have and that also includes the quality to   i believe a better buy would be the intrepid if you want american   if

558,0,  i purchased a   explorer xlt x in the spring of    i trusted since my   bronco ii x had lasted so long   but with another kid on the way   i need   doors and extra interior space   since the explorer at that tiem was basically a stretched bronco ii   which in turn was a with a backseat   i decided to buy one   the impresions were good   i drove one and compared to the gmc jimmy   it was much roomier   and so i ordered one   i ordered a fully loaded xlt which had more options the way i ordered it than the standard eddie bauer   the first   years were fine except for the squeaking doors   the interir remained large and it drove nice and looked handsome   and with my silver and blue two tone paint scheme   there were no other explorers that looked like it   then things started going bad in    the whole exhaust system was leaking like mad and then the muffler fell off   i replaced the whole thing with a borla unit   a couple months later   my first transmission failed   it not only failed   but beforehand it refused to shift out of second gear   so it was constantly bouncing off redline   i had my automatic transmissiion replaced out of my pocket   a short time later in early    that transmission completely failed while my son was driving it   another expensive   speed auto out of my pocket   by this time   the explorer was looking elderly   with a couple rust spots and with a bit of collusion damage to the rear bumper   soon after   the hubs and   wheel drive system started giving me problems   so i traded it in for     in july of   for a new   jeep grand cherokee limited    litre x   i always wondered who bought that lemmon of a car   until i had another encounter with it last week   my younger son and i were in our current car   a lincoln navigator x when on interstate    an older explorer that looked identical to our old soldier   albiet grille less   extremely dneted in rear left door   ripped seats   and cracked glass pulls out in from of us   i remember asknig my son    quot i wonder how many transmissions he s been through quot br br  
559,0,  i ve always liked fords   and explorers for that matter   but my third one put me over the edge   all three were bought used   between   k and   k   and all three were stock   explorers   two eddie bauers and my favorite of the three   a sport   first of all   i like alot of things about explorers   to be general   i like the size   the feel   steering and handling   the design   the price   and the look   it is a very practical suv   it tackles most off road trails   minus serious   wheeling   it performs well   it gets decent gas mileage    that is   new ones are much more efficient   it is easy to service   and it comes from an amazing car   helps define american cars   my complaints   fuel pump   anti lock brakes   power steering   transmission   radiator   overheats   minor electrical problems   starter alternator   you d be amazed at the re occurances of many all of these problems in my three vehicles   maybe it was a bad year   maybe we picked three lemons   but they all fell apart   we had the first one for two years before it was totaled in an accident   we put   or   thousand dollars into it just to keep it alive that long   power steering went first   then the brakes   rotors   pads   calipers   the works   followed by hard starting and overheating   the transmission was the last to go   along with an overhauled x   we were pretty happy with the car   despite little things like the backseat armrests falling off   when the time came   we opted for another   enter the two door sport   i loved that car   i felt very in control with it   and it was incredibly maneuverable compared to the xlt or eddie bauer   it had plenty of room   got better mileage   had more   zip   was easier to wash   performed better   and was just a fun car to own   unfortunately   it had every problem i mentioned before   power steering   bad   fuel pump   alternator   transmission   and electrical glitches   passenger window didn t operate   power locks were broken   the transmission was never replaced   but it would have   along with a badly leaking radiator   if the anti lock brakes hadn t failed   the right front tire locked up   and totaled the car   another one bites the dust   the third and current explorer started off flawless   and the previous owner gave us his personal guarantee that the car was in perfect mechanical condition   it probably was until it fell apart on us   we had the car less than   months when   on a short road trip   the engine burnt up melted died   no warning   just occasional temperature fluctuations from normal to way hot   and back to normal   the engine was very expensive to replace   compared to other engine jobs my friends and family has encountered with other vehicles   by the time the new engine was broken in   the starter started to go   the rear hatch power lock broke   the oil pan and gasket needed to be replaced   and the transmission started to slip   the transmission hasn t been fixed yet   but it is about to drop   i don t think i have anything nice to say about this last   as it is a true lemon   the sound system was very mediocre   considering it was their   premium   jbl setup   i only wish i could learn my lesson about explorers   or fords in general   but i can say now that i m probably not on my last explorer   they really are fun cars   and they are very moderately priced   or at least as moderate as any used car today could be   if i had a choice   i d go for a full size chevy blazer   staying american   but i know i d be paying a higher price tag for it   if i ever get another explorer   i d buy a few years newer   like     i hate looking at new car prices   and i would surely opt for the sport br br  
560,0,  a few years back    to be exact   my dad purchased a explorer used   with about    miles for   grand   at the time   it was a good deal   and it turned out to be a smart investment   i enjoy the features it comes with   nice stereo   leather seats are comfy   good for the outdoorsmen   the only really obvious negative qualities is the backseats   and the shocks   the backseats are really uncomfy   despite the leather seats   it doesn t raise up high enough for me   it was uncomfy when i was     and now that i m   feet it is killing me   also   as someone getting a driver s license soon   i have a permit   i don t enjoy a bumpy ride   i prefer my mom s    mercedes se   i think it is the shocks that cause it to be so bumpy   it isn t horrible   but if you hit a pothole it could throw you off the road   also   on another note   the engine began having some problems after   years   we had to get a new one   overall   good suv with nice features   and a couple of halting problems br br  
561,0,  i drove a   explorer on a road trip from texas to new york   i beleive it was a   wheel drive xlt model with all options except leather seats   this truck was nice in that it provided a nice view of the road   felt strong during all driving conditions   and provided more than the required cargo rrom for all of my gear   however   there was a huge downside to all of this   to put it as simply as it can be said the truck constantly felt like it was out of control   braking distances were super long   it bobbed and wallowed over the smallest raod imprefections   and every turn made me wonder if a roll over was going to happen   did a terrible job of engineering this thing   the wheel base is way too short and the center of gravity is way too high for a vehicle that is so massive   people are sort of lured into a fasle sense of security with these things   just because it s classified as an suv   they think tahy can do anything and go anywhere   the problems and firestone are having come as no surprise to me   the safetly issue when through my mind back in    when i took the trip   firestone my have designed a bad tire   but the trck is also to blame for so many deaths and injuries   on a typical passesnger car   a blown tire may cause a collision   but definately not a roll over   usually the most danage suffered by a motorist with a blown tire is a damaged wheels   this is not so with this truck   the thing that is most shocking about this is how people have continued to buy this truck after the safety issues surfaced   i suppose that can be attrbuted to suv s being status symbols instead of practical transportation   face it   if you have children   admit that you do and dn t try to be all tough and rugged looking in one of these death traps   money would be better spent of a station waggon of some type from a bmw   series   for the snooty sort   to the volvo   for safety minded people   to american wagons   i e   taurus for economy buyers   i really hope the congressional hearings uncover some type of cover up by and result in a massive recall where all explorers are bought back from owners and scapped we will all be safer     
562,0,  update well   at the bottom of this review i stated that i would keep the   tour unless something major went   it did   at    miles   the power steering rack failed   since the v contour is relatively rare blah blah   it was going to freakin   expensive to fix   so i worked out a deal with the dealership that i would buy another car from them if they covered the repair    i know   another i must be insane   right   so   i m picking up my brand spankin   new focus zx mtx with the new   l pzev engine later today   look for a review with my initial impressions in the focus hatchback section soon cheers ken s rip    contour se    miles   rack was repaired   now running well but   years is time to move on   here s to the good times she gave me hello to anyone who reads this   this is the first and possibly only review i will write for this website   which by the way   i think is great    i mean the website is great   not that i m only writing one review i have owned my    contour for   years and put k miles on it in the process   consequently   i feel that i m qualified to offer a fairly competent review on this car   i ll try to get as much info in as i can   so i apologize if this gets a little long   i purchased my blue   contour se in january of    with k on the odometer   it is equipped with the    duratec v with atx   power locks   windows   mirrors   cruise control   traction control    wheel disc abs brakes   and the sport suspension   even after   years of ownership   i still thoroughly enjoy driving my contour   i won t lie and say that i ve never had any problems with it   however   the problems have mostly been minor and my contour has never stranded me anywhere   nor has it ever failed to start   below i will try to list my likes and dislikes about the car and as many of the repairs as i can remember   i have had the car   years so i ll probably forget something steering handling likes    first of all   i love the thick leather wrapped steering wheel   it just feels good in my hands and is very comfortable on any length car trips   the steering action is fairly quick with about    turns lock to lock and has a nice moderately weighted feel   the handling dynamics of this car are just awesome   my contour corners predictably and almost completely flat with little nose movement during accel deccel   it feels composed and confident right up to the tires   adhesive limits   the brakes seem very grippy to me   as that i live in a somewhat rural area   i have engaged in interesting maneuvers with deer on several occasions over the years   managing never to hit one thanks to the handling and brakes   also   as that i live in a great lakes region somewhat rural area   i can say that the abs feature has kept me out of many a ditch and minor fender bender during the winter months   dislikes    in this department   these are mostly minor quibbles   but in the interest of parity i ll list them anyhow   tire and brake wear seem to be a bit excessive to me   i average about   months out of a set of tires    r   and only about   months before i m in need of new brake rotors   although the brake pads last about double that   due to my semi aggressive driving habits   i can t really fault fomoco for the aforementioned problems    well   i guess in this blame someone else culture   i can fault fomoco for making the contour too fun to drive   another minor quibble that started at about k miles is that occasionally the rear suspension will emit a squawk during quick shifts in load   mostly on quick right turns   i believe i have isolated this problem to the rear anti roll bar bushings   which i will replace when the weather warms up around here   finally   the communicative steering and taut suspension that make the se so enjoyable when driven hard lead to a somewhat rough on the back side ride on uneven pavement   not for everyone engine transmission   likes    the    v is just as smooth revving as it has ever been   even at k miles   it is not the fastest or most powerful engine in this class   but it has plenty enough to move a light little contour around quite nicely   this seems to run best in the   to   rpm range   though it is not at all horrible of the line   i average about   mpg in the winter and   mpg in the summer with mixed driving and about   mpg on road trips dislikes    nothing really on the engine   however the automatic transmission manages to irk me every once and awhile   the main gripe on the atx is that it is at times very sluggish on downshifts   specifically at   to   mph highway merging speeds   i don t think that there is anything specifically wrong with it other than bad gearing by   which probably had to take fuel economy into account when designing the atx   other than that it shifts smoothly   though it is definitely due for a fluid change interior likes    fomoco did their homework here   the control layout ergonomics are excellent   the turn signal wiper stalks are located perfectly   they are completely visible and can be operated with just extended finger tips while leaving the rest of my hands on the wheel    i think this design was copped from vdub   but who cares   it works   the cruise control layout is typical and the buttons have bumps and depressions for intuitive use at night   the large   sweeping instrument pod houses all of the controls surfaces   a drivers side vent   both of the center vent ducts   a handy little bin for change   a clock   and a useful storage bin underneath the radio   the center stack is skewed slightly towards the driver   giving easy reach to the radio and hvac controls lending an overall cockpit    driver oriented feel to the cabin   all of the window and lock switches as well as oddly enough   the door handles are nicely backlit   the center console is well laid out   contains one cup holder   more on that later   and has useful storage under the armrest   finally   my favorite interior features are the front seats   for me   at     and   lbs   the driver s seat in the se is extremely well side bolstered offering great lateral support during cornering   however   it might be a tight fit and or downright uncomfortable for people that are much wider than i am   the seat bottom is also well bolstered and usefully long enough so that it doesn t cut off mid thigh like most any other car i have ever driven does    i m not that tall and i don t have particularly long legs so why is this the case car designers   the headrest is quite useful as it can be adjusted forwards as well as up and down to a point where you can actually rest your head on it while driving   dislikes    again   nothing major   just some nitpicky things in the interest of fairness   the cup holders   the original spring loaded   virtually useless for anything but a can   pair of cup holders are long gone   in fairness and surprisingly   they didn t break on their own   my se s original cup holders came to their untimely demise by way of my friend s foot when he was making an emergency transfer to the back seat to relieve himself in an empty ice tea bottle while we were hopelessly snarled in pittsburgh s three rivers   stadium parking gridlock   the replacement unit graciously supplied by my friend is a slightly more useful   though just as cheap single unit which i make sure is in the closed position during any current and future trips to pittsburgh sporting events   the center armrest is for one elbow only   preferably mine   but it doesn t always work that way   a coin flip or scissors paper rock are useful methods for determining armrest custody on longer drives   the driver s window control switches require a minor wrist contortion to operate   though the lock switch is perfectly located to be bumped thus locking the door when exiting the vehicle   which is nice when you actually intend to lock the door   not so nice when you are say   going to pump gas and leave your keys in the ignition   it has happened   it is a bummer   the unlocking mechanism for the gas lid only works in colder weather   during the summer months i must open the trunk and use the auxiliary unlock lever located there   a minor inconvenience   a few rattles emanate from the dash area   most notably from the vents   the vent open close gates seem to be the main culprit   there is also some rattling where the windshield meets the dash which i believe started after the original windshield was replaced repairs i ll list what i can remember with an approximate mileage and some comments   as earlier stated   i ve had this car for a long time and it is after all   a   so i m probably going to miss something fuel injectors replaced at around k miles   the car was hesitating badly so i took it to my friendly neighborhood garage   they did the work under warranty even though it ran out at k   who says that all service departments are worthless   not i   coil pack replaced at around k miles   one of the cylinders was misfiring   this repair cost about    new water pump at k miles   anyone familiar with the    duratec knows that this is a common occurrence   in my mind   common enough that should have recalled it   but now i m being unrealistic   i did this repair at home with a little help from a friend at a cost of    for the pump and     for the   pack of busch light new front wheel bearings at k miles   the driver s side bearing started to sing   the passenger s side bearing was fine   but it made sense to replace both as a preventative measure   the cost of this repair was around    new speedo cable and speed sensor at k miles   either the speedo cable unspooled and trashed the speed sensor   or vice versa   what ever happened   the speedometer and cruise control took a break and the atx went into limp mode which means no overdrive and rough shifting   though it felt like there was something seriously wrong with the car and that might have been it for old bessie   but the new parts were only    and the repair was simple enough for me to do it myself new intake gasket at k miles   this gasket is made of a fibrous material and is either nickel or aluminum plated around the intake openings   the plating eventually wore away and the fibrous material degraded to the point where the many small individual openings became several large openings which in turn caused the engine to idle poorly   i left this repair to the professionals at the garage for a cost of    very early on   before k miles   there was something wrong with my gas peddle where on an intermittent basis   i would push it and nothing would happen   i don t remember what exactly was wrong and the problem was fixed under warranty i should note that i m not much of a motorhead   meaning that i don t particularly enjoy working on cars   i do change my own oil and brakes and engage in the occasional minor repair because i enjoy even less giving my money to other people to do something i am capable of doing myself summary overall i have been satisfied with the ownership of my contour   the everyday drivability of it is still very good   all of the accessories including the ac still work great   i ve contemplated getting rid if it more than once   but every newer car i have tried   focus   civic   jetta   i don t like big cars   failed to be sufficiently better enough to justify signing up for   more years of payments   at this point   with k plus on the odometer   i m traveling into territory where few fords have gone before   it is almost like a neat little science experiment and sporadic repairs averaging around    beat the crap out of a    monthly payment   as long as the se doesn t drop its tranny   or something similarly major   i m going to keep it   ps i don t know if anyone will even read a new review about a   contour   but i would appreciate and welcome any and all feedback thanks for looking ken s
563,0,  i bought a used contour in    at that time it had k miles on it   i wanted the car right when i saw it and wanted it even more after test driving   i had some trouble getting the car to pass md inspection   minor stuff   brakes etc   it took a while to accomplish this   about    total cost   the car was great   others would look at the car in awe and i loved it   the car offered speed and comfort and made me feel like a queen on the road   i was able to keep up with the big dogs on the road   nice right   the truth about the contour did not wait too long to rear its ugly head   six months later   the transmission began to slip   although it was still covered under warranty   i had to still pay     summer      tire blow out   the car had to be aligned and i had to buy   new tires   the mechanic said that the car was so badly out of line   he wanted to know how it got that way     for tires and a serious alignment summer     the engine sensor came on   it began to make a loud humming noise   i dragged it to the dealer and they told me that it had something to do with emissions   that repair cost me     summer     the car began to make this horrible noise   i was told by a mechanic that it was the sway bar another     fall    winter     power steering fluid leak   the dealer fixed the leak and charged me      days later   the car had no power steering and the fluid leak was worse than before   i took the car back and the dealer told me that the engine mounts were bad   another    fall      speedometer goes out   the car needed speedometer cables   another       i am dealing with this issue right now fall      the engine light is coming on and off again   i have not had this one checked out yet   i can t afford it   will charge me    for a diagnostic test   imagine how many times i have paid that since the summer of   my air conditioner has not worked   i can not afford to pay for it   perhaps later   other problems continue to surface that become more important to repair   the blower switch only operates on the level    that gets pretty hot in the winter   i have to ride with the back windows down while the hot air blows into my face please understand that   i keep all oil changes   for the last year i have been driving k per day   before it was k per day   for about a year   i have paid for regular break work   tune ups and transmission checks   tire rotation   i have one cup holder   the car still makes a rattling noise underneath and makes a thumping sound when i am sitting at a light   i can actually feel the thump   and can someone please tell me how is it that the break lights go out so quickly   i would estimate that i have spent close to   if not more   than    on this car since i purchased it   everyone who knows me is waiting for that next event   i have   more payments left   i have decided to wait it out   once it is paid for   i will be very happy   i am a single parent of   and this car is bleeding us   the sad thing about it is does not seem to back their product   once i get out of this   i will never step foot into another even if the price is right   my kids will know the same when they get older   an entire generation will be anti  
564,0,  i bought this car as a second vehicle and used it only for work in another city   it was a gl model with an automatic transmission and k miles on it   i paid    for the car and it had a leaking radiator when i bought it   the owner prior to me was trying to sell the car for over    and i was the only offer   the cup holder had long since broken off due to its flimsy design   after the radiator was fixed   for     it ran fine for the next six thousand miles   it does seem to have a lot of road noise   though   in freezing weather it also had a distinct knock from the timing belt slapping the top of the timing belt cover   after the engine warmed up and the metal expanded   the knock would stop   thinking the timing belt was simply stretched   i had it replaced for    including new ignition wires and plugs   i never drove it in freezing weather again so i do not know if the new belt corrected the problem since i moved to a new city i tried to sell the car for the retail price   no takers   no phone calls   i lowered the price to    under retail with still no takers or phone calls   finally i had to ship the car to my new address   again i tried to sell the car for     i e   half way between retail and wholesale according to edmunds   with not one single phone call in the entire seattle area   i finally offered the car for     which is only    above wholesale   i only got three phone calls   the car only had k miles on it all during this time the car simply disintegrated   the main seal at the flywheel began to leak prodigiously   the car also had a distinct oil smell in the air conditioning system when i stopped at traffic lights   i had to re seat the valve cover gasket   taken off for the timing belt   because it is a poor design and is easily mangled during installation   the car also began to hesitate severely   i believe this was tied to the   check engine   light which began illuminating periodically   finally the car would not always start   which i believe was a failing starter solenoid i eventually sold it for    but had to split the repair costs with the new owner in conclusion   even when the car ran fine i could not get even close to the book values and finally sold it for    above wholesale   in addition the car required over    in repair bills for just   miles of wear   needless to say i would not recommend the contour     
565,0,  my husband and i leased a   contour d   auto   with air   and power everything   we were pleased with it at first but slowly became disillusioned about a month after we bought it both cup holders were broken   which ever genius decided to put them between the front seats and made of such flimsy plastic ought to be fired   then the drivers seat broke you couldn t move it forward or backward come to find out the seats had been recalled so they replaced it free of charge    took them almost a month to do it   then the blower for the heater air would only blow on low kind of cold to ride in in the middle of the winter in new hampshire   cost to repair    which it stopped working again in about   months   lastly the engine light would come on and off and we took it to they said a wire was loose causing this to happen   well one day just driving down the road in   the car just stopped running   after all was said and done the engine had seized   no one to this day has been able to explain this to us since it had oil in it was a well maintained car   cost to repair      we left the car at the dealership and haven t seen it again i feel sorry for the next sucker to lease buy it br br  
566,0,  i purchased a   contour in august     the car had terrific handling and decent performance from the    liter   banger   for the first   months i thought i made a wise decision   first it was the little things both spring activated cupholders broke   no biggie   but not covered under the extended warranty i passed on the service departments offer to replace them for     from there it was all downhill the blower for the heater stopped working    months later i was getting awful clunking groaning noises in the front end   only to find my stabilizer bars and stabilizer links were shot   wouldn t you know that stabilizer bars are covered by the extended warranty   but stabilizer links are not   to make a long story short during   and early   i was at my dealer   times for suspension related problems   and   times each for tie rods and front wheel bearings   with my    deductible for each visit   plus costs for non covered items   this car was killing me financially the last straw came in may     at k miles   exactly   miles after the extended warranty expired   the transmission dropped   i don t care what car you drive   but no car should need a new rebuilt transmission at   years k miles   my local zone office manager refused to look at the car   and further refused to offer any financial help   he flat out told me the only way they would help me is if a court told them to   imagine that   great customer service   huh   i needed to fix the car   but i wasn t going to let touch it   instead i took the car to an independent transmission shop   five weeks and    later my car was back   why so long   turns out it s nearly impossible to get the transmission parts   because everything was on national backorder   plus my transmission guy informed me this was a   throwaway design   and by far the most difficult transmission job he s done   he said he ll probably never do another contour mystique transmission again   and if he did it would probably cost nearly double what he charged me   after arming myself with a written statement from him   as well as finding dozens of owner complaints online pertaining to the transmission   i took another shot at and threatened to litigate through my state s attorney general s office   needless to say   would up settling with me nearly   months later for     which was better than nothing   by august   i was totally fed up with this pile of rubbish and i traded it in for a   lumina   which turned out to be a very smart move   and it s not just the    s   or the   cylinder automatics my cousin owns a   contour v   speed which has been a disaster from day one   specifically an oil leak that can t seem to fix   as of july     he s in the process of getting to buy the car back under my state s lemon law   to any potential buyer   you would be well advised to shop elsewhere   my advice to current owners   if you have had premature automatic transmission failure and have had to shell out a bunch of money   let know about it   there s no way you should get stuck for expensive transmission work on a throwaway transmission   would never admit it   but i m sure they know this car has been and will be a disaster for them  
567,0,  like everyone else   i waited to see what was going to replace the venerable tempo topaz model with   and was surprised to see the new contour   what s more   as the motoring press praised the new car   especially the upscale duratec v se model   i thought i should go visit my dealer and see what the fuss was about   as i was in the market for a replacement car   it just so happened the dealer had a toreador red se manual demonstrator model with   kilometres fully loaded   except the cd player   the car was an absolute dream to drive   a smooth   powerful   throaty v   a nice   speed   and wonderfully supportive heated leather seats with these nifty   airbag inflaters   that blew up for lumber support   etc   i am in canada and leather on a minus   degree celsius day can really be uncomfortable   the car also had a really nice traction control system and this seemed like the car of my dreams and was a great winter driver   being   months old and    under list price made it a good deal plus it qualified for new car leasing   so i signed a   month lease and drove it away late that week well   for the first month i loved that car   it was a dream to drive and suited my single sport sedan lifestyle   then things started to go wrong   serious things that no warranty covers you for   one minus   morning   i drove the car out of my garage and headed off to work   the car seemed a little sluggish   but i though it was ok as any canadian will tell you how   stiff and tight   a car becomes on the first cold day of winter   especially newer cars   i was driving about   kilometres an hour through a   lane intersection when a school bus decided to turn in front of me   i turned clear and hit the breaks and next thing i know i am spinning circles through the intersection   i never had a car do that to me   i didn t hit anything so i pulled out of the intersection at the time noticing my abs error light was on   when i stopped and got out   i noticed steam and smoke rising of the rear brakes which was strange as one would have thought it would be coming from the front wheels with such a hard braking   my car was fitted with the really nice looking polished spoked alloys from   stupid me reached down and touched the wheel   big mistake as a chunk of skin burned onto the spoke   man was i fuming as i pulled into a snow covered car park to realize my rear brakes where locked on   the ebrake was off and functioning fine   i called the dealership   and they send down a tow truck   that afternoon they called me and said this was normal to have your brake piston caliper slide pin freeze when you take a warm car out of a garage and into the cold   what a   amp load   they said they parked the car in the garage and an hour later it was fine   so i went to get the car well   would you believe what happened two weeks later   spinning out of control again with the rear brakes locked   didn t hit anything this time either   this time the dealer had to deal with my wrath as i told them i was not going to pay my lease and they could stick that car where the sun didn t shine   they calmed me down and called me later to say that   they had noticed a few of the new contours rear disk calipers brakes slide pins were not lubricated properly from the factory   and they had done this to mine and that it was now better then new   so   i went to pick up the car   two weeks later   brakes were now working great   i noticed that the car was starting to get a slight grind putting the car into first   the clutch was too new to be worn out and i am not a hard driver on clutches   as the week wore on   the grind got worse and worse until the car would no longer engage first gear   hot or cold   back to the dealer   they called me to say they could not know what was wrong without dropping the transmission   all on a   month old car with   kilometres   so they took it apart and said the transmission st gear was faulty and needed to be replaced   two weeks later and driving a dealer loaner   my car was still not fixed   the parts were on terminal back order   mad as could be   i fumed at the service manager and many calls later to customer service in canada   the dealer had a brand new replacement whole transmission being shipped from the kansas assembly plant   one week later   i was back in my car but immediately i knew something was not right   the car was all over the road and there was a strange thumping noise that got worse and worse   this time the new transmission was working fine    days later back to the shop turns out the mechanics had not completely tightened all the bolts on the front subframe assembly that   cradles   the transmission and   that afternoon i was back in my car   but now it was not driving straight   pulling right   but was tight    minutes out of the dealership the engine error light came on but i was too mad and tired   i just drove it home and parked it in the garage   next morning i got up and went to the garage and thought i could smell gasoline   i got in the car and the smell was unbearable   what i found next was unbelievable   behind the drivers seat the floor pan was protruding up about   inches and the rear carpet was soaked in gas   i looked under the car and a pool of gasoline was all over the floor   i poked my head under the car and it was clearly evident the car was hoisted incorrectly by someone at the dealer on the floorpan right along the fuel lines   and one was ruptured   no sales manager has ever heard such a mad customer as i tore up my lease on the phone   a tow truck came and took the car away   two days later   the dealer had me a brand new identical   contour se v   the only difference was this one was automatic with a cd player   my new girlfriend wanted an automatic and the dealer gave me exactly what i asked for   same colour   sunroof   leather   etc   etc what i did notice on that month old st car with barely   kilometres disturbed me   the nice grey leather seats had started to develop creases in the drivers seat leather   the car had spend some time in the cold   but was garaged at night   i would not expect such cosmetic problems to surface for at least a couple years   my current car   a   honda accord se has    kilometres and the leather looks like new   i am not a big guy and the seats are treated with the same leather conditioner i treated the leather with   the dealer took care of the lease and paid the cost differences to keep me happy on the replacement contour   that car lasted   month until on one cold canadian morning i started the car and the starter   stuck     burned out and exploded into several pieces doing quite a bit of damage under the hood   cancelled my lease and i have never put foot in a dealership again now my story will may not be the typical ownership experience   what i did like about these cars was the duratec v was a dream to drive   when it worked   the fit and finish was ok for a domestic car   the value for money seemed good   the cars were nimble and sporty to drive   the back seat     was a bit cramped but i didn t usually have rear passengers and the   had rear seats that were   scooped out   to give more rear knee room   the factory sunroofs were nice in that they retracted into the roof fully   the cars were nicely appointed with all the fixings you would expect on a premium se model   the cars handled really nice   when they were put together properly   with the sportier handling on the se versions   the   wheel disk brakes and the traction control did a nice job of getting the car moving and stopping even with the sport firestone radials on the icy roads we have here in canada   i can t say to much about the gas mileage as i never did get to drive the cars enough   the leather seats were really comfortable and very adjustable to any driver   driver leg room was good   i am a tall guy   and the telescopic tilt steering wheel could be set up nicely   i never got to test the cruise control   steering wheel mounted   on my first car   nor on the second as it never worked on the replacement car   would i recommend one of these cars   i think you can answer that if you have read this far    i don t know if i had really bad luck but i do know my   cylinder   older   honda is not as powerful or new   but it sure is reliable   regular maintenance only and no major faults   some of my problems were dealer technician caused   but the problems should have never been there in the first place   my dad summed it up best    quot never buy a new model car   wait a couple years until the bugs are worked out   or at best   buy your car at the end of its product cycle   even it it doesn t seem as   new   anymore quot   i think he was spot on with the    contour se models br br  
568,0,  i have owned two different cars in my life and am not impressed with either one   the first one was a   escort bought new   it broke down on the freeway less than a month after purchasing it   needed a new engine head and was in the shop for two weeks waiting for parts from detroit   that was only the beginning of problems with that car   needless to say   years later   i am persuaded to give fords another chance   my husband and i bought a   contour gl    door sedan   it seemed pretty nice at the time   with about    miles on it   we have it only a couple of weeks when the cup holder breaks   now this may not seem like a big deal but they are made of   very   flimsy plastic   and i accidentally set my purse on it which totally snapped it off   the cost to replace it   how about     the cupholder is still broken to this day next the fan switch stops working   well   it works   but only on the lowest speed   if you turn it up   it turns off completely   visualize us desperate for some a c with our faces pressed close to the dash vents the rear doors start making this horrible screeching noise when they re opened   wd   has no effect then the engine light starts coming on and off randomly   we take it to several different places   nothing is found to be wrong   the latest is that the transmission sounds like it s starting to slip   i dread the thought of a    tranny repair cost   all i want to do is unload this car   but unfortunately fords do not hold their values that well   and we probably could barely sell it for what we owe on the loan i will never buy another again   i know some people swear by them   but i have owned many honda   toyotas   and nissans that served me much better and i think i ll go back to what i can depend on br br  
569,0,  i bought the contour in november    as a second car   about a month after i drove it off the lot i started hearing a rubbing noise from the front   the problem turned out to be a front stabilizer bar bushing   unfortunately the bushing is   pressed   onto the bar at the factory   so you have to buy the entire assembly   another   better idea profit maximization at the expense of the customer   the extended warranty refused to cover the repair   so i was out approximately    a short time later   my   check engine   light kept coming on   the problem was diagnosed as a defective exhaust gas sensor   once again   the extended warranty wouldn t pay for the estimated    repair since it was not a covered component   s emission warranty likewise passed the buck despite the fact that the sensor is part of the emission control system in the summer of     the engine cooling fan fried and the blower switch to the heater air conditioner stuck in the   low   position   after spending almost    to replace the cooling fan and fuse assembly   i just received a recall notice from almost   years later   in addition   this car chews tire   suspension   and brake components with reckless abandon   i ve been through two sets of rotors both front and rear   three sets of disc brake pads   and two sets of tires   the car has also developed a head gasket leak and drips oil on the exhaust manifold   creating a most unpleasant smell when the car is warm although this is a trifling problem by comparison with the other woes i ve had with the contour   the ergonomics are poor   the power door lock button is located so close to the armrest that i ve locked the keys in the car on a few occasions getting out   and i might be the luckiest contour owner on the face of the earth because the cheap plastic springloaded cupholders in my car still haven t broken yet   imagine that   this is the th product i ve owned since   and the most trouble prone of the lot   it will definitely be my last  
570,0,  i purchased this vehicle after driving my    toyota celica to the ground delivering pizzas   i was then done with that job and wanted a decent car to last me a long time   i found a two year old contour for    and decided it was a good deal and got it and in fact it hasn t been a horrible car   despite a few recalls   it keeps running with minimal maintenance   i think the worst problem i had was that the tires needed replaced   but there is always a feeling owning this car that it is going to break down any time   the engine is loud   the v   and doesn t have a very smooth sound   there were some knocking too that had nothing to do with the type of gas i was giving it   i had also spoken too other people who had owned the car   and their opinion was more negative than mine   they said that the car was plagued with recalls and was not very reliable the drive was decent   nothing too notable   compared to the celica i had   it rode up high   the v didn t have a lot of muscle   despite the fact that my contour had a manual transmission   i am certainly glad i didn t get the automatic all in all   it was a good car while we owned it   we traded it in after it had    miles   i didn t want to press my luck any further   speaking of trade in   i didn t get much for it    k for a    i know i could have gotten more but not much more   but overall   there are much better choices out there   i traded it in for toyota and i am very happy with that   the   quot comfort quot   level   i e   the confidence in the car   owning the toyota is much higher than it was for the if you can find a good deal on a contour   a really good deal   go for it   but otherwise keep searching br br  
571,0,  i have had nothing but problems with my contour since i bought it   within two weeks the cup holders broke   they are ade from flimsy plastic located in between the front seats   next the driver s side head rest broke    to fix   so needles to say i don t have a headrest in my car that is functional numerous factory recalls and   as terms them   extended warranties   these include front strut springs   both of mine failed within a week of one another   others include under hood wiring   heater blower switch and heater fuse   these are just the ones that i have had problems with i recently found that this car has a    fail rate in transmissions above    miles   are you kidding me almost   in every    i know because uses a type cee transmission   that they have known is problematic since they started using it in    if your transmission goes it ll run about    to    to fix   rebulid or replace my second issue is with itself   i purchased my car and purchased the    mile power train warranty   it was    miles or   months   get this my transmission failed   day after the warranty    mos   was up my advice is if you own one   rid yourself of this car fast   if your going to buy one don t   and always ask a dealership what kind of transmission is in the car   if they say cee   then laugh and walk away  
572,0,  i purchased a    contour gl in aug of    for     it had only k kiles on it   it had the    four cylinder and   speed   before the warranty expired   the deal replaced free the rack and pinion steering syste   the a c blower   condenser and evaporator   and did some recall service   it was already a lemon under warranty   the cup holder broke kwik   the headlight plastic lense turned dark yellow   deminishing light output   the alternator failed   i had to replace the battery twice   and the alternator was very very hard to remove and replace   my mechanic friend replaced it and ins not a good sign when a pro complains about your car   the throw out bearing in the tranny was about to go out at k miles when i sold the car in feb of     the car had bad resale value the only good thing was that my mpg never dropped below mpg in the city   i routinly averaged   mpg on long out of town trips   and the seats and fron leg room was comfortable    i m     with long arms and legs the back seat was very small   everyone complained   handling was bad too   i replaced the tires with some michelin roadhandler sports from sears and made a huge differance in cornering   excellent tires can make up for a bad car   it has horrible breaks   they fade very quickly   if you want a cheap car that breaks a lot and has no resale value buy the contour   if you want a cheap car that is dependable and has decent resale value   buy a   altima from nissan  
573,0,  this is an update on the report i wrote a while ago on my car   i currently have   kms on the odometer and have had some more serious problems since the last review   i still maintain my opinions about the awesome driving dynamics of the car and the powerful and delightfully high revving v engine that powers it   every time i drive the car   it never ceases to amaze me and amuse me   i absolutely love the engine   it sounds so great and is more than adequate to move the car along   i still waste much more gas than i should   but i can t resist the beautiful music the makes when it reaches top rpms and the corresponding pull it develops   i recently had the brake pads and rotors replaced since the originals were warped and had hairline cracks developing due to age    but hey     kms out of the original brakes is really something    especially considering that this car has been driven   the car has   wheel discs   with abs   so the brake job was rather expensive   but obviously necessary   now for the bad aspects   the waterpump and its gasket blew in the summer   some abs regulator blew at the same time   the low speed fan and some other components broke   days after i got the car back from the aforementioned repairs   that alone would have cost me around   cdn if it weren t for the extended warranty   the splash shield has been rattling around badly and actually fell off after the fan was replaced since it wasn t reattatched properly   i ve had some dash lights burn out and i have also had a tie rod break somehow    don t ask    i don t know the car is in good repair right now except for the resonator which is bad just due to age   but the rest of the exhaust system is looking all right   the glitches have finally been sorted out    it s about time   however the time has come to sell the car and get something new   a vw golf gls   t is a definite prospect   no matter what kind of car i get next   even if it were a ferrari   i will miss the contour   it hasn t been the most reliable car   by any means   but it has definitely been a great driving car   it still puts an ear to ear grin on my face when i drive it   high performance out of a sleeper sedan   i love it   my ownership has definitely been characterized with a love hate type relationship with this car   i love it when it works   i hate it when it s in the shop   as for the bad resonator   i think i ll leave it be   because if i fix it something else is bound to go wrong   i can live with a slightly louder than normal exhaust system     
574,0,  the   my husband s dream car    quot i really want this car quot   he says    yes   i m sure you do   so i   dutiful spousal unit that i am   re arranged our family budget to include the extra insurance and payment that would trail the joyous ownership of such a car   and so it was that he left one day and came home with a flashy hunter green    such a pretty car   well   it was pretty until this one certain woman my husband is married to accidentally ripped off the driver side door   yes   we are still married    quot after all what is insurance for quot   says he   indeed unlike many men with new vehicular toys   my husband actually tried to encourage me to drive his car   he wanted me to like it as much as he did so he could justify the expense and claim that i used it as much as he did   however   at the time i had my own broomstick   a f x flareside truck   i had no interest in his puny car   but i did drive it once in a while when he stole my truck   and following is a summary of that i think of this vehicle the gt comes with a very powerful v   engine   manual   speed transmission   you can get them in automatic   however you will get less mpg   power doors seats mirrors   dual airbags   dual lighted vanity mirrors   rear shoulder harnesses   driver and passenger bucket seats   fully adjustable power driver side seat   air conditioning   and lots of other nifty little extra features that any self respecting car should sport   the glove compartment in the front passenger side contains the trunk popping mechanism   and the center console has a nice divided change holder and cassette cd holder thingie   everything is pretty much within arms reach while driving   in spite of the positive points and pure flash value   i did not enjoy driving this vehicle and actually avoided it   i found that the bucket seats put me far too close to the ground   and i felt like i was in the cockpit of an airplane trying to peek out over the dashboard    yeah   as if i have ever sat in the cockpit of an airplane   i felt unsafe and nervous because i could not see very well behind me   around me   or even in front of me   the tiny mirrors did not help matters much at all   had we installed a   quot wink quot   mirror   i probably would have felt better about driving the car   but we never got around to that because my husband liked it just fine   he is much taller   though   and does not find his nose hitting the dashboard   and he mainly drove it the   speed manual transmission shifted fairly smoothly   but the gears seemed to be very close together   this was not a problem for me   because i have been driving manual transmissions since i was    my dad used to own a racetrack   and i even drove his old   speed on the column h pattern trash truck for him   most young people these days have never even heard of one of those   but those close gears could make missing a gear easy for inexperienced manual transmission drivers   so i would practice on an old vw bug before driving this type of car if you have not had a lot of practice with clutches and gears   the gas mileage we got was about   mpg in the city   and a bit more on the freeway   not good   but not horrendous either   additionally   insurance rates are pretty high for this type of vehicle   as you can well expect   my insurance   usaa   put out a book which rated the safety level of most of the popular cars   and the did not score very well in any category   despite the dual airbags and anti lock brakes   i am sure there are many reasons for this   but the fact that the vehicle is capable of great speed probably contributes while the leg area was very ample and could easily accommodate my husband s    frame   the seats were very narrow   my chunky lil bootie just barely fit comfortably   a very large hipped person would not be able to fit in those seats   and if they did manage to squeeze in they would have the seatbelt latch digging into their outer thighs   additionally   the back area is so small that only very small adults or children   and under can really ride in any semblance of comfort   my son had to lay down in back when he rode in this car   needless to say when my husband and i went out with our oldest son   i got stuck hunkering in the back   after a while   i just stayed home acceleration is   needless to say   very fast   this car reminded me of a song by the band alabama called   quot i m in a hurry quot   a line in the song goes    quot my car s not new but it ll zero to sixty in    quot   while that figure may not be accurate for the   it probably comes close   i found myself speeding every single time i drove this car   because you simply do not realize how fast you are going   i had to constantly be on my guard   one time i realized i was doing   mph in a   zone   yikes   another thing don t buy these cars in red   especially if you have a lead foot   unless you set up a separate speeding ticket fund   they are cop magnets for some reason   the dark   inconspicuous color of my husband s car probably saved us both from numerous tickets the corners like there is no tomorrow   the low center of gravity and wide wheel base helps the car hug the road on even the sharpest corners   again   however   this can lead to disaster when drivers become over confident and misjudge either the sharpness of the corner   their own ability to control the car   or both   follow the suggested speed limits on corners at all times   especially in this car   because it is easy to loose control when you go   mph on a   mph curve   i would recommend this car to responsible singles and couples   it is not   in my opinion   a good family vehicle   even though a car seat would fit in the back   i would not transport my baby in this car if i had another choice   there are too many safer cars on the market   this car is not   in any way   suitable for teenagers or inexperienced drivers   the combination of hormones   inexperience   and speed are often deadly   likewise   it is not suitable for very elderly drivers who may suffer from vision impairment   slow reflexes   or distance judgment   or any driver with such impairment for that matter   shortly after i ripped the driver side door off   don t even ask how   hahhaha   we traded the and a deathtrap plymouth grand voyager   see my review on that hay wagon   toward a   excursion   and i sold my truck   we had   cars   and not a single one of them was a safe   large   reliable vehicle for a family of    i felt bad about my husband s dream car flying the coop   but i had to relinquish my truck as well   so my sympathy level diminished rapidly   the needs of the many definitely outweighed the need of the few   anyone know how to kill a vulcan for coining that phrase br br  
575,0,  after we got all our money back from our   convertible due to the lemon law in florida   we used that money to order another new but instead of the white color we ordered the laserred with the camel color top and interior   we were disappointed in the   when the engine blew after owning it   days   it was brand new   and then the transmission went later we were thrilled with the car    cylinder   we drove it here   we drove it there   it s seemed like a nice car but typical   the pick up was sluggish   the seats were low and not comfortable   the cup holder was situated over the button that makes the top go up and down and the water dripped onto the button and i was waiting for it to short out some day on a hot day in south florida with the top up   the a c didn t cool like it should because the sun beats down on the canvas top and there isn t any insulation so all the heat enters the car   there s no room in the back seat for people to sit   it is only good for either babies or double amputees   the trunk is small   the stereo average the gas mileage good   the convertible is easy to open and close   our problem began about   months after owning the car   there was a vibration and we kept taking it in and they told us it needed to be aligned so they aligned it and it still vibrated   after months of going back and forth with the vibration and    later for new tires   they told us the tires were the cause and we purchased new tires   i told them that i had the torque converter and transmission and engine go bad in our other but they told me it wasn t any of that   it was in my mine   by that time i was out of my mind   when the service manager opened his drawer i saw a notice for torque converters and i asked him about that and he fessed up   the torque converters are bad and they have a quiet recall because they don t have enough torque converters to replace on all the mustangs and they could only fix the ones with severe problems   again   this is the second with big problems   we had the car for   months and i wasn t about to go the lemon law route so i told my son we would buy the   gt convertible and trade this problem vehicle in   i had read that the gt didn t have problems with the torque converter   wrong again   when will i learn   see my review on the    amp    mustangs   same problems different years   the is neat to look at   but a big disappointment   if only would build a good reliable i would buy one despite their major flaws but they don t   we now own an explorer sports trac   let s see how that goes br br  
576,0,  i bought this vehicle in october of   mostly because i was coerced and bullied by the salesmen at my local dealership   i liked the looks of it   but   being my first new car   was extremely naive in how to go about purchasing one   i had looked at a few other cars   such as the sebring   the stealth   used   the camaro   and the avenger but never had the chance to really think about it and decide which one i liked best   anyway   since then i have decided that i would never buy another and would not recommend it to anyone   first of all   the pickup on the v engine is lame at best for such a   quot sports quot   car   secondly   the interior is the most poorly designed that i think i have ever seen   let s start with something as trivial as the cup holders   they have situated it so that the larger of the two holders is furthest back   but it is so large the the average cup inevitably spills every time   the smaller of the two holders holds the cup comfortably   however it is so close to the stick shift that it makes it impossible to put a drink in it without knocking it over in the process of shifting gears   then   the seatbelt holder sticks out so far that as soon as you sit in the seat   it hits the side of the door     locking the door   and     creating a dent in the plastic on the door   the legroom is cramped and tall people have a very difficult time riding in my car   the high beam device turns on opposite   you have to push it away from you rather than pulling it towards you like a normal car   to every other car that i have ever driven   which is frustrating when you try to pull it towards you out of habit   the trunk is pretty good sized   but don t try to put a large suitcase in there   because the distance between the edge and the top is so small it prevents you from being able to get it in there   i ll admit that it s a pretty car   but that s about it     
577,0,  after ten years i gave into my teenage cravings for a   the adult in me limited myself to the v   stupid adult   the v with the sport package looks fabulous   and in spite of being one of the most common cars on the roads   gets complements from some   those who can t tell it s not a gt i m sure   unfortunately that s all the good that can be said for it it is very cramped   anyone over   feet tall   or who carries more than one passenger   or who travels and needs to carry a lot of stuff should just pass on this car   the trunk   like the back seat   is almost to small to be useful   much of the interior is not very well though out   for example   you can only put a drink in one of the two cupholders   as one interferes with the stick shift   i can t believe they let it go like that performance is uninspiring   granted it is the v   but my   probe    cylinder   was much more fun to drive   they need a new category for the v   it s not a compact   and it s not a sports car     it s too big on the outside to be call a compact i m sure   it s worth noting that the car looks much bigger from the outside   than it feels on the inside   kind of like dr   who s tartus in reverse i wil admit that the car is a pretty good bargain   and i picked mine up as a year end clearout   so i don t feel cheated   but this is my last br br  
578,0,  i rented one from hertz while on a business trip since they were out of the reserved type and was looking forward to driving it since i had heard people rave about it i was quite disappointed actually   the engine was loud   this could be a plus for some it had a rough idle and was generally unrefined though powerful it did seem to smooth out over   mph somewhat   the interior layout   amp   dash were ugly and badly designed it actually looked cheap    i strongly felt i could have designed a better dash    my tercel had a nicer   cleaner   smoother layout   the power seat controls were difficult to reach   i m    quot and i had to actually get out of the car to properly adjust my seat this is not the kind of car i would like to own ever i guess i was   spoiled   after riding the saab    which is a lot more expensive   you get what you pay for i suppose i find it hard to believe that a nicer sporty car can not be built at this price range take one for a test drive and see for yourself br br  
579,0,  the first time i saw the silver     i new i   had   to have it   needless to say   i drove it home that day   i bought the vehicle   because it had the sporty appearance that i was looking for and it really was not that expensive   compared to a lot of other sports cars   what i love about this car   aside from its looks   is the fact that the power is there when you need it   it gets really good gas mileage and of course   my kids love the fact that there is a horse on the steering wheel   the only downfall is that the back seat is not very roomy   right now my kids are small and there is plenty of room for them   but i can not see an adult being too comfortable sitting in the back seat   the car handles really well and is easy to maneuver in and out of traffic   i recommend this car to anyone in the market for a car with a sporty look at a decent price   by the way   the electric adjustment on the drive s seat is a must     
580,0,  i bought a     cylinder in may of    the car started out to be great   but turned into a   quot sour fruit quot   shortly after when i originally bought the vehicle   i tinted the windows and put an alarm on it only to find that the power window module was poking holes in the tint   after i had a couple of car full s of people     i noticed that the back shocks were not holding up the body of the car as well as it should   not only that   but at    miles   the tires became bald   also   after i was able to get used to the car   i noticed that the seat belts were not retracting properly   therefore leaving the seat belts hanging out of the car when i closed the door   the engine has been good so far except for this summer when the starter   alternator   and the battery gave out   all of the problems i had with the car should have been covered under warranty   but when i took the car in however they either said go to the manufacturer   tires   or we will try to fix it   in which case   most of the time it did not get fixed   i have been told by many people that you either love your or you hate it   i see it this way   if you want something different from everybody else on the road and something that can handle normal car   quot responsibilities quot   then do not buy the   if you do have money to burn and you do not expect much from your car   then the is right for you br br  
581,0,  this is a beautiful car   great styling   very comfy   the convertible top is almost childlike in it s ease of operation and the mach   sound system is the best stock system that i have heard now   for the bad news   the lacks quite alot in the performance area   to be the flagship sports car in s line of autos it is sadly disappointing   i bought the after owning a   chevy z   with a   speed transmission   supposedly these two are   quot comparable cars quot   not quite   though the s suspension rides nicer and sits better on the ground to allow for better cornering   in the long run that doesn t remotely make up for the difference in power   the s    liter engine   though good on gas   lacks the gusto of the    ls in the camaro   if you are in the market for a great looking   comfortable ride in a car that has a sports car imagine but passes up most gas stations due to the lack of raw power this is the car for you   but if you want an all out beast and want to get your money s worth in a so called sports car   i suggest you pass up the dealership and head for the nearest bowtie shop br br  
582,0,  october   i decide to get myself a new car   after driving heavy suvs or sedan   i thought i could switch to a smaller   more maneuverable   more economical and quicker car well after little shopping around   big mistake   i bought a because they gave me a great deal and more money than anybody else for my old wd   i first thought it was the best car because i had been used to drive older cars   the was new   clean   runned smoothly and quiet   and smelled new then   i quickly realized that it was not a sport car at all   it certainly is a coupe with little room inside but the engine and chassis are far from being sport car elements   with a too big and heavy   l engine they only get   hp which is ridiculous above all considering the very heavy weight of the car   too heavy to be a real sport car   this car needs a smaller and more efficient engine with at least   more horse powers and lighter material to lose about   lbs   then you d start getting interesting results   might also need a   speed instead of a    i definitely recommend choosing a stick if you want some kind of sensation so that you can go up in the rpms and get a little power   the car max speed is alo limited electronically and usually varies between   and    mine never went above mph   but considering how dangerous highways are and how many cops are out there   it is more tha enough   the competition just left the behind in the dust as far as performance is concerned and handling probably too   this car chassis is   or   year old   suspensions are more comfort than sport   and the weight also alters the handling   the camaro v has a lot more horse power   the golf gti is quicker   the mitsubichi eclipse is quicker and more economical   handles better   a great buy inside the car is pretty nice and well organized   it is comfortable for a sport car unless you are above    quot   then leg room is an issue in the front seats   in the back   forget about the seats   you could barely fit a   year old   might as well be no seats and more leg room in the front like in a mr   my friend who is    quot   actually fits comfortably in his mr   access to the rear seats is not easy either   the base model comes with a lot of features   all power   alloy wheels   rear defrost   remote entry   cd player   big mistake form   not including floor mats   how cheap a few positive things about my   it is economical   never had to fix anything   well the cd player went dead but the warranty took care of that   gas mileage is great for a big v   basically   an oil change every   or   k miles it seems reliable   except for that cd player   no visit to the mechanic quality improved   the plastics used inside are not bad at all for a cheap car and it is assembled pretty well   no noises in the car even after k miles   tires went slick fast though quiet ride   for a sport car   it rides smoothly and is quiet   the seats are also more comfortable than average the price is low and the car looks good   it has a lot of standard features for the price including cd player   however   it does not deliver as a sport car   just buy it for the looks or if you have to own a overall   it is a good ride but not a sporty one   at red lights   i could not even try to compete with most sedans like the accord v   mazda v   some pick ups   for sport   if you have to own a   get the amzingly powerful v but then be careful because the chassis   suspensions will not tolerate driving mistakes   they are not good enough for that power plant and on the rain better stay under   rpm   my husband bought a v after we sold the v and he loved the sensations i guess the v is a good car for a young driver as it is cheap and is not too quick i would not recommend it otherwise br br  
583,0,  three years ago   i finally could offer my own brand new car   coming from france   i wanted something i could not find there   something typically american   i looked at the new sebring and found it a little expensive and very heavy   i was not that impressed   plus it looked like a car designed for older people   so i thought i would go for the myth   the so worldwide famous   i was so excited by the purchase experience and the fact i was going to own a brand new car that i did not realize how bad this car was for me after a few months of driving   the excitement of driving a new was gone and reality struck   the can not seat four people   so why bother with the rear seats   unless you put kids in the back   kids up to   or   top   my   year old   a little tall for her age   was not even comfortable in the rear seat   well   the truth is the can barely seat two if the front occupants are big or just tall   i am    quot   and over   lbs   i drove    i sold that car after   years even though it was paid off with the steering wheel sitting on my lap   my left knee stuck between the turning signal and the door   my legs would start hurting after a couple of hours of driving due to the lack of leg room and the uncomfortable seats which were also too short too support the top part of my legs   a tall person would also find the passenger side uncomfortable because of the seat itself and the lack of   quot knee quot   room   the dashboard above the glove compartment is extended toward the passenger to an extreme   this significantly affects the leg room which would otherwise be decent for this type of car next disappointent was the engine   or more exactly its lack of power for such an heavy car which brings me to the next flaw of this so called sport car   it weight   how can you call that a sport car    horse power that do not deliver in spite of a pretty big engine   liter   a european or japanese car equipped with such a big engine would deliver twice that power and be a lot more efficient   or they would only need a   l to   l to deliver   hp on a car    lighter   a sport car should not be that heavy   the weight affects the handling and decrease pick up   i had small pick ups totally blew me away at red lights   how embarrassing   the camaro six cylinder does better wit a more powerful engine i love the shape of the even though it is too high and massive for a sport car   the quality is better than i expected and it is loaded   what a value   can t beat the price for a car equipped with cd player   power doors   mirrors   remote entry   rear defrost   etc   however   i think all cars should come with floor mats   it is ridiculous to make them an option another plus for this compact   door not so sporty car is the size of the trunk   however   the opening is tiny so don t even think about loading any big items   the ride is acceptable at low speed   but becomes unsafe when taking curves a little fast or driving on a rainy day   this car rear end wants to get ahead of the front end   so get used to it before playing the race car driver if you want the sport look at a low price without the power   it might be the car for you if you are single   no family in that car br br  
584,0,  i bought a   because i fell in love with the car the moment i stepped foot on the car lot   i bought it the same day i took the test drive   the car is beautiful and amazingly comfortable   although has great servicing for these cars   i am disappointed that within six months of owning the car i am having trouble with the engine   squealing tires   loose windows and creaks of every possible kind   i take great care of my vehicle and do not abuse it in any way   the problems started with a horrible clicking noise in my left front tire and seems to escalate to additional problems on a daily basis   it seems that i spend much more time at the dealership than i should   especially with such a new car   by the way   they do find something every time i go   i am not imagining things   i have often heard rumors about cars   but chose to ignore them   it seems they might not be rumors after all     
585,0,  i ve owned   cars in my life   some new   some very old   but this takes the cake   over    miles and no repairs   no problems   heck   i haven t even had to change the brakes yet   whoop s   my wife just reminded me   we had a turn signal bulb that went out   total repair costs in    miles      amazing   plus we get    mpg around town and on a recent   mile trip averaged   mpg on the road   and that was as she purred along at mph for a good portion of the trip   the seats are comfortable   yet offer enough support that even on our long trip   we never felt fatigued   the   l v is smooth and responsive and this being said from a guy who drove bigblocks in the   s with ample power    she will sqaull the tires from a dead stop   and when my wife isn t with me   i just love blowing the doors off the hondas   acuras   toyotas   and what ever other piece of jap crap is cruising the local boulivard    even us grey hairs like to have some fun now and then   my boss has the same year camaro v   and i can out run it   out gas mileage it   out handle it   and i don t have to fix it once a month   and all for only    less than he paid   then there is the obvious   it s looks   bright red   on one of the best body styles of the   s   this car is just flat beautiful   it looks mean just sitting there   buy is sleek enough to slice through the air with outstanding aerodynamics   sure the back seat isn t that big   but it holds my   teenagers   who would much rather be driving her   with no problems   though i m sure they wouldn t want to take a long trip back there   and yes the trunk is small   but it is a sports car   not a sedan   if you need more back seat   or trunk room than what this car has   then you shouldn t be driving a sports car   i highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a car with some flare   great fuel mileage performance   extreme reliability and less expensive than anything in it s class   mustangs rule  
586,0,  i bought my   v brand new at the end of    despite poor salesmanship the car seemed a good looker   had reasonable pace and i had every reason to believe in reliability so i bought it   at around     i believed and still do i got a bargain first and foremost with    miles completed this car has never given me any maintenance headaches   touch wood   in this respect it has filled my paramount expectation   of course the first question is v or the gt   well coming from europe   l seemed like a huge engine and the extra cash for the gt a little unnecessary   three years later and    on the clock i regret my decision to plump for the v   its not that   l v lacks pace it just does not compete at that sports car level i imagine   l makes all the difference in performance the interior has been forgiving of my carelessness   with a little maintenance the upholstery and dash are in almost perfect shape   seats are not luxurious but none the less comfortable   the front seat is electronically controlled while the passanger seat is a lever outside   this car is a looker bought in   i still get complements on its sleek silver exterior   get the spoiler however i have become concerned about how my handles in the rain   coming out of the car wash and on one occasion the texas snow   the car has a tendency to fish tail especially when building up from a complete stop   i think the reviewed   th anniversary models compactness may take on board this concern   that salesman told me a lie about them changing the design overall   this is a solid reliable car   i have maintained it well and therefore expect it to run at least another    miles   i very rarely have more than two people in my car but on the occasion i do it s less than comfortable in the back   neither does the bless us with a lot of trunk space   bottom line    this is no family car  
587,0,  i am not a car expert   but i know i waited many years before acquiring what i thought was my dream car   in january     i bought a   convertible   cylinder automatic   no doubt   this pony was beautiful to look at with its bright atlantic blue paint and white top   but in the department of performance   the car was lacking   many fanatics told me i got what i paid for as they swear by the gt engine   i was disappointed especially after driving three rental cars after the was rear ended and in the shop for repairs   all three of the rentals were equipped with   cylinder engines and all out performed the   cylinder    rentals were a   chrysler sebring   a   intrepid   and a   pontiac grand am   i just expected more from the than delivered i understand has improved the performance of the     cylinder mustangs   but i am waiting delivery on a   gt convertible   now i will sit back and let the fanatice criticize me for choosing an automatic   cylinder over the standard transmission    br br  
588,0,  unlike the fellow who reviewed an   crown vic by owning an   model   i can give you the real story   first   the car has a good ride on dirt roads and a huge   ten dead body sized trunk   it also has a bunch of crush space to absorb collision impact   the lack of road feel is a positive thing   both in rural areas and over city potholes they look alike on the outside   but the   model has demonstable shortcomings   my experience is based upon getting to borrow my mom s   crown victoria   which is a wonderful car except for the front bench seat   and subsequently buying a   crown victoria   thinking that i would be getting the same critter   the earlier car is a boat anchor that has occupied space in the yard for the weedeater to trim around   while the   model has soldiered on trouble free the   has an igniton module that simply quits going down the road   it also has the aggravating characteristic of testing out all right on the test bench   but not working in the car   the   model has a different system   the fuel injector is a throttle body type in the    and a tuned port type in the    which is far superior in driveability and economy   the seat back broke inside   and it won t stay upright   the seat has absolutely no lumbar support   which is verified by driving mom s   model   which is not broken   also   the car has    wheels   which makes finding used tires large enough difficult my car was really cheap   with no body damage and only    actual miles   but it was no bargain because it s ignition and fuel injection systems were badly designed   i have only gotten a few miles out of it while mom has gotten another    with hers without a hitch   her car gets pretty good mileage   has    wheels   and has better acceleration   of course   mine has no acceleration most of the time   execept behind a tow truck don t buy an    get an    which is a fishing car beyond comparison   if you want cheap transportation with room for your xxl buddies and all their gear  
589,0,  the that i work at owns a   lariat   that lives up to s    quot fix or repair daily quot   reputation the pros   although limited are as follows   the   ci engine is full of torque   and pulls trailers up relatively steep inclines    grade   easily   the cab is huge   and easily sits five people   six if they like each other   the rear sliding window is a nice addition   and the air conditioning is excellent   this truck looks nice on the outside   and the paint is in fairly good condition   although off white was not a good choice now for the cons   this truck has    miles on it   and has had three engines   and seven transmissions put into it   as of now   the seventh transmission is in bad shape   and will probably have to be replaced in six months or less   this is to be expected   being a heavily used work truck   but i believe we should be getting a bit more mileage out of each component   since not many people drive the truck and it is usually babied   the seats are the most uncomfortable i ve ever sat in   the contouring is all wrong   and you sit way too far into the seats   the headlight control between bright and dim is on the floor   which is sometimes hard to find   especially at night   when it is most needed   the tailgate had plastic elements that became heavily stressed and broke   so the only way to open the tailgate was with two people and two screw drivers   the exhaust mounting is hardly up to par   and two have broken   manual hubs are ridiculous   especially in a truck manufactured after    minor mechanical failures   and electrical glitches have put this truck in the shop for much more than routine maintenance   gas mileage with the   is absurd   averaging     the two gas tanks this truck sports are absolutely necessity   and before going anywhere   you have to make sure they are full we recently put a service bed on it   and replaced the entire ignition system   the is purchasing a new truck near in the future   and i won t be the least bit surprised when it isn t a br br  
590,0,  i got my   escort brand new in    i was in the market for something that would be easy to maintain   get me around good distances comfortably and be a good first car   i initially was looking at used cars   but decided that a new car would be good   since the warranty was a big bonus to me   having little knowledge about cars and car maintenance within    km   i started having to double clutch to get into reverse about half the time   yes   it s a manual transmission   and double clutching is when you take the car   which is not moving   from whatever gear you were in   into neutral   lift the clutch   depress the clutch again   and then engage it into reverse   i took it into the dealership i bought it from and asked them to look into it during some other routine maintenance   oil and air filter change   they only did the oil change that day   when i picked it up   i inquired about the air filter and the double clutching   they said they d have someone out to where my car was parked to show me how to use my transmission    and install the air filter   well   the assistant service manager   i think that was his title   came out   he was very condescending   until he had to admit that   a   he didn t know what type of air filter my car needed    b   he didn t have the tools to remove the old one   and   c   he didn t know how to properly install the new one   this is really confidence inspiring after this amusing demonstration   he proceeded to tell me that first is a   magical gear     i m not making this up     and that i always need to put it into first before trying to put it in reverse   i explained that i usually have it in first   because i m usually going slowly before wanting to go in reverse   but i acknowledged that i might not always do that i went away   trying to be sure to always have it in first before putting it in reverse   i found that without double clutching   i often wouldn t be able to get it into reverse anyway   i took the problem back to the dealership   and same condescending attitude from another staff person   who proceeded to tell me   oh no   it s not first   it s second that is the magical gear   on my third complaint about it   i got the nice fellow who works behind the counter to admit that based on his experience driving my car   there was a problem getting it into reverse   i wish i d gotten it in writing   he no longer works there and i haven t been able to get it fixed among the other   admitedly minor   problems and or complaints i ve had with the car include   no interior trunk release   i have to get out of the car   with the key   to unlock the trunk   after many service attempts   my car is still often hard to start when cold    i m sure my starter will have a shorter life because of the amount of time i have to engage it to get the engine to start   and i don t live in a cold climate   interior dome light only works intermittently   upon complaining about it   they reluctantly replaced the light bulb in it   though i d repeatedly explained it wasn t the bulb   because it was intermittent overall   i do have to say that i really like the little car   and i like the refinements has made to the focus which really improve on the escort   however   after my service experience   there isn t a snowball s chance in hades that i ll ever buy another   and don t get me started about how much it s worth now    i had a local saturn dealership make a trade in offer on it   and i was very sad   and decided to keep the car a bit longer to get some value out of the depreciation i ll have to eat when i sell it things i like about it   handling   gas economy   sharp look   if a bit cartoonish   comfy seats   trunk space   even in the sedan model br br  
591,0,  i drove a   explorer xlt for six months   which was used on and off road   the explorer is a comfortable ride and has ample cargo space as compared to my   jeep cherokee and other small suv s   with the back seats down   the vehicle was able to hold all of my field gear while conducting drilling activities on a hazardous waste site   believe me   when you work on haz sites   there is a lot of gear to be toted around   the duel open action of the back window and tailgate was a nice convience   since you could just open the window to retrieve objects   with the hinges of the tailgate on top   the tailgate would act as a shelter during rain events where note pad could be kept dry i was very pleased with the on road handling of the explorer   but was disappointed with its off road use   the auto wd function was a nice feature that operated flawlessly during the wet season   that was the only thing i like about the explorer for off road use   my biggest beef was the low clearance of the vehicle   tree branches were snagged by the frame on two separate occasions   on one occasion   a stick interfered with the gears of the vehicle   i could not get the truck out of gear until someone crawled beneath the vehicle and pulled the stick out   try that repair alone on an off road trail   another time the vehicle slipped into the tire ruts from heavy equipment and bottomed out   i was able to get out by immediately gunning the engine   i was surprised that the vehicle came out of that situation considering the lackluster of past   wheeling   several times the explorer could not pull itself out of a muddy area without a running go   these were similar areas that my   cherokee handled with ease   one note   the explorer probably would have done better with real mud tires i loved the vehicle for its on road use but hated its overall off road use   who should buy   anyone who wants the status of an suv and does not plan any off road excursions except for maintained gravel roads   who shouldn t   anyone that needs a good wd vehicle for heavy off road use because of the lackluster wd experience and low clearance of the   explorer xlt   i upgraded my   cherokee to a   isuzu trooper   which is also reviewed by me separately br br  
592,0,  the explorer is not the biggest suv   but it is too big for me   i can not stand driving in it for many reasons   first   it is a very flimsy car and a collision with anything larger would mean my death   also   it has horrible suspension which makes listening to cds impossible because of all the skipping and every ride is very uncomfortable   the gas mileage   although good compared to an expedition or excursion   is much worse than i would hope for   it is about   miles per gallon city    miles per gallon highway   with the gas prices as high as they are having a car which guzzles this amount of gas is killing my wallet   finally   despite the atrocious size of this behemoth and the trouble i have in finding a parking place for it   it is still impossible to fit into   it has room for five people   if you and your friends don t have legs br br  
593,0,  i purchased the explorer for its styling   space and published reports about the excellent performance i love the safety aspects of the vehicle and i hate the current performance of the vehicle   just crossed    miles the vehicle drives like a   year old truck ready to stop any minute the vehicle performed satisfactorily till about    miles when problems started     had to replace the engine thermostat   main gasket and water pump     had to replace the exhaust sensor    the transmission appears to be slipping   although the dealer says it is ok   and it is giving   miles per gallon the above repairs are in addition to the normal maintenance done on the vehicle like     replace battery     replace all   tires and align wheels    replace front and back brake pads and turn rotor br br  
594,0,  my second explorer   a wd   has been a different experience than my first   a   model   i have   miles on it   and it is on its rd automatic transmission   this time around i am out of warranty   and out of luck   and after pleading my case with   i was told they will offer no comment or assistance   outside of several thousand dollars in repair expenses on a   year old vehicle on its rd transmission   the car has performed satisfactory the interior has remained solid   free of cracks and fading   amazing in the   degree summer heat of my area   it has not given me any engine troubles and the brakes and normal wear and tear items have been uneventful   they have reduced the cup holder size   and removed the slot for coffee cup handles   so that if you are drinking anything other than a fast food small drink   it will be on your lap due to lack of room handling is o k   however as will as explorers i have driven or owned   the rear wheels slide in wet conditions when making a corner   even at slow speeds the paint still looks new   my color was called mocha   but looks gold   and the black trim cleans up well   i would warn that dealing with on repair issues can be painful at best   and to document everything with the service department     
595,0,  i drove a explorer for three years and i liked it until i realized what i was missing   because it was my first car i had nothing to compare it to   but after having driven other cars i realize that the explorer is not that great   its suspension and handling are really awful compared to other cars in its class and it cost me a ridiculous amount of money for gas and all too frequent repairs   i was comfortable inside it but that was probably because i shelled out about     above the starting price for extras   although suvs are traditionally intended more for off roading and that type of thing i assume most people buying one right now would be interested in driving it everyday as i did   which is not something i recommend br br  
596,0,   apparently the automatic closing sliding door feature is in earlier windstars as well   but i m sure we would have heard about more injuries if they were made so improperly i b the windstar   b i went to visit my fiance at work yesterday   he works at a   dealership b   and often gets to see the features of new vehicles before they are released to the public   the one good feature i saw   is that the    windstars   come with   tv s and   vcr s    i m not a car person   and i don t know whether the earlier versions have tvs or not   him and his co worker had a   sony playstation   hooked up and were playing games while in the comfort of a heated minivan b i the downside b i they were sitting in the vehicle   and i was outside the side door was open   my fiance s foot was hanging out the door   i lifted the handle   this vehicle has an b automatic door shut feature b   the door started to close   and wouldn t stop   i yelled at him to move his foot   luckily   he did    the door shut and sealed itself quietly i   i couldn t believe this   he assured me there were sensors to stop the door   but when he was trying to show me   he had to wave his hands all over the place   and even still   it hardly ever stopped closing the door    there are only two little motion sensors b b i let me ask you this i b what types of people usually use minivans like this    families   mothers with children b   if a mom were to turn her back   and the door starts to close   a kind near the door could be hurt very badly   since the closing is virtually sound less   the only sounds would be the kid screaming over a lost finger b other new features b   there is a low tire pressure warning system that lets you know when your tires are low     litre   v engine   power windows   locks   brakes   child safety door locks b the b as well as having a not so great vehicle here and there   the     also has its downfalls   they don t honor warranty if you are at or even near the ending term or mileage limit   their parts cost more than you can get at an independent dealer    fyi   the employees are charge fifteen percent more if they want to get something before their pay day i i in general   i don t feel that windstar   is a very safe vehicle   but that s just my epinion i b thumbs down    or off     to windstar b  
597,0,  i first drove the   windstar as a rental in orlando this january   i was quite impressed   it had a smooth ride   convenient features   and easy handling   so   when my husband switched to a job with a car allowance the next month   my vote was in   i did lots of internet research to find out what model we wanted   what the price ranges were   etc   we settled on a very nicely equipped model and found one for    under invoice and     financing   so we went to pick it up   things went relatively smoothly at the dealership since the deal was already worked out   however   i was still there for over five hours   anyway   about the van    good things    comfort   the windstar has a very smooth ride and nice handling   it is very easy to drive and comfortable to ride in   it is so easy to get into that even my two and a half year old son can climb in by himself   the seats are comfortable and the driver s seat has great adjustments   the interior is generally roomy and cupholders are everywhere   safety   all five of the rear seating positions are equipped with tether anchors   the van is equipped with flashers on the side mirrors and cornering lamps   the flashers on the side mirrors also flash whenever one of the sliding doors is open   warning others that a child may be about to dart in or out of the vehicle   windstar has dual airbags and very good crash ratings   all the doors automatically lock when the vehicle is put in drive   there is even a sensor that is supposed to let you know if the tire inflation is incorrect   convenience   when the rear seat is removed   the back will accommodate a full sheet of plywood   a real plus when you have to prepare for a hurricane   the keyless entry system comes in handy when you are juggling groceries and a toddler   the sliding doors always work smoothly   you can usually put just about whoever and whatever you need to into this van    bad things    problems from the very start   when we tried to install the cargo net   we found that one of the knobs was broken   the first time my husband removed the rear seat he discovered that there was a missing knob   when he took the van to the dealership   nearly   miles away   they did not have all of the necessary parts to fix it   he did not want to make another trip out to the dealership for something they had already had two opportunities to get right    so they said they would mail the part to us when it came in   we got the part alright    the wrong one   this has yet to be resolved   a few weeks ago the battery was completely dead for no apparent reason   upon recharging it has been working fine   right now there is already some sort of front end problem   the steering wheel makes a strange clicking noise when you turn it   all sorts of unexplained sounds have come and gone in the short time we have owned this vehicle   it is ridiculous in a nutshell    i will be glad when saturn puts out a van  
598,0,  well its been a while since got a thread reply from epinion so will post what its been like with this car in over a year i too am very disappointed in what the car has to offer feature wise verus the msrp price paid   over kwtt l one of the biggest was the lack of a full drivers information center giving an account of the cars functions   your finding this now on cars costing half as much   at least it should have had gas miles to empty it does not have dimming mirrors or lighted vanities the vanity mirrors are a sight to see   they are so flimsy and cheap looking   the car does not have a memory system to set seats   and other choices per drivers   the seats are very limited in power choices too   the passengers just goes backwards and forward   would it have kill to put in a simple homelink system on the visor like the lincoln ls   after all its the same car basically no locking gas cap   they had to work overtime to cheap out this car   another small item is the lack of clips to hold the floor mats in place   they are just light material sliding all over the place   the top is a major inconvenience off   its laying in the corner of the garage waiting till can get some friends over to put it back on   this seemed better than using that rickity looking cart   the cloth top has not closed properly since day one   i did go by a dealership but the repair recommendation made you wonder if would be worst off   now for those wheels   they do nothing for the appearance of that car   looks like a hubcap set   as for running errands you are limited   the trunk is very shallow   a bag of groceries or even a slightly large boxed item will not fit back there   so you try and put it in the seat beside you hoping a brad is not on the bottom to scratch the colored seats   you do need a nd vehicle   practical   along with this thing on the i m not a mechanic but it doesn t have that much get up and go   it will go but not like the old push rod motors   you seem to plan your passing in advance   top may be good but low end punch would be nicer   on the window dropping to allow door to open well don t open the door fast or it has not completed and shakes the glass   if it forgets to drop you have to really push it open   this may be a big problem as the cars age and more electrical glitches develop   all the articles and reports of unsold    units just sitting on lots with slashing prices and offering rebate to try and rid of these cars   does not make you feel good about spending this much on a car either   gosh   s coming and they still can t sell the   s   announced the cancellation of the car too after a year on the market  
599,0,  has once again tried to bring back the thunderbird   but let s face it   the car that has carried the thunderbird name for half a century has really been about five or six distinctly different cars   other than the name   these cars have nothing in common   the only version that sparked any interest was the   s t bird s   and the   s were the last time a thunderbird was ever a respected and exciting vehicle   it s been a downward spiral ever since with the exception of the supercoupe from     arguably the fastest t birds ever made i own a   thunderbird and it happens to be a very ordinary passenger car with the exception of some luxury features not found on other vehicles   the   thunderbird is more of the same except with a different look   and a grossly inflated price   who is going to pay     for a lincoln with a t bird name on it   these days it seems that anything with a different look is popular   regardless of what lies underneath   and what lies underneath is the same thunderbird i drive everyday   which was less than half the price compared to the   the fact is   the thunderbird lost its    mojo   after the   s and became yet another family car with a puny engine it s hard to imagine that this car was ever compared to corvette s   it would be like ferrari taking the maranello   adding room for four people   popping in a hp engine   and raising the price to a million dollars   anyone interested   didn t think so for the t bird to be reborn   needs to drop a big time v engine in it   with somewhere in the neighbourhood of    horsepower and   second    times   then we will have the thunderbird the way it was meant to be originally   a sports car again   chris
600,0,  what you are about to read is what i got from a weekend rental of the   escape   i was kinda excited when i found out i would be able to drive one of these for a whole weekend in my search for an suv   our local dealer had no problem letting me take the vehicle for the whole weekend   he was sure i would be back on monday to make a purchase well once i first got in the vehicle i did feel alot of comfort   after checking out my surroundings i did notice that the head room was incredible   but how much do you really need   the seats are comfortable   but pretty boring   they were just a plain tan color just average   after a couple minutes   i really felt as it i was in a caravan of the late   s   it just has the feel of a mini van   i was very disappointed with the center console   it is nothing more than a huge pit   there is nothing there to really hold any cd s   spare change   whatever it may be   it was basically a nd glove box   nothing spectacular once i started the car up i could tell the power   upon trying to put the vehicle in drive i notice that the gear selector is on the column   didn t we phase this out yet   very outdated   once i left the lot   i noticed right away that the engine had power   but was pretty loud   the vehicle has excellent pick up the escape i borrowed had very few options   basically a stripped model with floor mats   and mud guards   the options it did have like power windows   power door locks   etc   were all placed basically the same place as any other vehicle   and they are all within comfortable reach of the driver   radio had some definite volume   but you need to so you can hear music over the road noise once i finally got on the highway and pulled out on the on ramp   i was ready to take the car back to the dealer   the engine though peppy is extremely loud as well as the road noise of the vehicle   i found myself talking much loader than normal to be able to communicate with my passenger   very disappointing with the road noise   but speed and handling were very nice to keep this short   i had the vehicle all weekend   and hardly drove it at all once i got home   it is pretty basic   and a little boring   the v   engine had more than enough power   but they need to build something around it summary it is definitely one of the lower priced x vehicles   but there are other options out there   i would suggest looking to other makes and models   as the salesman told me   all the fathers are buying these for their daughters   so maybe the road noise is an outta sight outta mind kinda thing   good luck in your suv searches  
601,0,  i purchased our taurus lx wagon used with k miles and we bought it because i was impressed by it s long list of features and by the way it drove   we had just sold our aerostar minivan and we were looking for a smaller   more economical family car   what we ended up was a car that just can not be repaired properly and is not very reliable we have had problems with the interior door panels cracking   the dash bubbling   the power window motors burning out   turn signals that work when they want to   a moon roof that has hardly ever worked   inability to align the front end so we go through a pair of tires every k miles   i have only had it serviced by and they have failed to repair most of our problems even after numerous attempts   the dealers no longer believe in test drives   they just look for a problem and charge you even if they can not find it   i got charged     to be told that i needed a new     battery   i also took the car in to have a rubber seal around the door replaced and they charged me     just to tell me how much it would cost to replace this is my rd and last   i had two explorers and bought both of them back under the california lemon law i wanted to love this car   i wanted to forget about my bad experiences with my two previous explorers but this car is by far worst in every manner i have had it with   quality is not job     profit is   don t even get me started about the fact that knew about the firestone tire defects for years but still kept putting them on my explorer and all others   i was the lucky one who is still around to express my displeasure with   the only reason i still have our taurus because the value has dropped faster than my loan for it   if i sold it today i would lose a few thousand bucks     
602,0,  in   my wife and i purchased our taurus gl wagon with an extended warranty   the warranty was a ge capital product that covered the car out to    miles when we first bought the car   we were really happy with it   at the two and a half year point   the problems started   on a trip   my father noticed oil leaking from the car   when i check the oil   the dipstick came up clean    no oil   the car was four quarts low on oil and i had not received so much as an oil light   the gage light in the vehicle checks only pressure of the oil   and not oil level i immediately took the car in for service   a failed gasket was found at the base of the oil pan   this was repaired under warranty   no further damage was apparent   as for the oil light   i was told that this only comes on in extreme conditions   the service manager on duty informed me that if the oil light comes on   the engine is probably to the point where serious damage is being done well   this ended up as the tip of the iceberg   when the car had    miles on it   my wife was driving and i was away on a business trip   it was over   degrees and the engine seized up with no warning   my wife and two young children were stranded for an hour before they got help when my wife called the dealership where we purchased the car   they instructed her to have it towed their   they made her sign an agreement saying she would be responsible for the cost of any repair work that was no covered under warranty   they also told her that this repair would almost certainly be covered under warranty   but the claims adjuster would have to look at the car i m sure you see the writing on the wall   after several hundred dollars in labor and no real repairs   my wife was told that the car was not covered under our warranty   her attention was directed to the fine print that stated that engine over heat   regardless of the cause   is not covered   we had meticulously documented all maintenance on this vehicle   and even in spite of our previous problems the vehicle repairs were not covered   to make matters worse   i later discovered that if i had purchased a extended warranty rather than the ge warranty   the repairs would have been covered   the reason this made me furious was that i was going to buy the warranty   but   the sales staff told me that the ge product was better and cheaper the final straw came when i made one of several calls to corporation to complain   i was told that the problems i experienced were   quot due to normal wear and tear quot i will never again buy another product i am only giving this vehicle   star because i can not give it less br br  
603,0,  what could anyone be thinking to buy this truck   as my good friend foxspy said   its not a truck   its a compact car with an oversize trunk b pro   s you say   you want pro s to this car   ok   i ll try   but its not going to be easy it sits five people   that s nice   what i left out in the original sentence is that it sits two people comfortably   the red paint is really nice   as said before   really knows how to do paint   they might as well be able to do something right   four doors is awesome   it has the two butterfly doors   making loading easier   but not easy   the tonneau cover that this truck came with is a nice addition   but even it has its cons   it offers a full size spare   but what pick up doesn t   that s enough for pro s   i m worn out with all of this thinking   i m going to something that comes a little easier b cons b this is the princess of   quot fix or repair daily quot   the model of which i speak is a    little over    miles on the clock   how many times to the shop   too many   lets see   its already had to have a recall done on the cruise control   it wouldn t shut off   after that   it had automatic windshield wipers   but not as fancy as the cadillac rainsense wipers   these wipers would just come on for no particular reason   this has been happening to lots of these trucks according to the dealer   transmission problems are normal right   not three months after you buy a brand new truck   its been in the shop for other reasons   but they fail my memory right now   not a reliable truck er car updated    so the got good crash test ratings   how about a real world account   two more teens i know just purchased   s and   s   which is something i will not stop ridiculing them for   what a stupid choice   anyways   one of them got a little out of control at highway speeds and ended up totalling the front end of the truck   the airbags did not deploy until she had successfully smashed her nose on the steering wheel   if that s not bad enough   then the airbag deployed and slammed her back   if you even consider purchasing this truck   i will never read another of your articles or consider you a peer   as you are obviously mentally challenged loading   good luck   the fold down rear seats fold down so you have to climb over them updated    four bangers are notorious for good gas mileage right   not with the   with this iddy bitty inline four cylinder   i d expect to get at least   highway   my friend swore she got thirty miles per gallon   which her particular truck did   but any other owner of a    liter i will report never even touching mpg   now you may say this is ok   i might too   if it was a vortec   with power   but it is gutless   its outfitted with a towing package   but if you can find something it ll tow   let me know   you couldn t tow a jetski in this thing with all of the hills on the way to lake powell   or into phoenix for lake pleasant updated     rear spring weight is useless   me and a friend asked her why her rear end was so close to the ground   she replied that she had some cement in the back   no more thought given   i was on my motorcycle and asked her if she could take my backpack home   she agreed this truck does have better payload than a motorcycle   i opened the trunk i mean tonneau cover   only to discover two bags of   lb   cement   that s not even the weight of the average male   with the rear end sag   i was expecting to see at least seven bags the tonneau cover looks awesome on this truck   it is very nice that is implementing their trucks with such a cheap accessory to try to make up for more expensive problems    tonneau is actually a that makes bed covers   but recently all bed   quot lids quot   have been referred to as   quot tonneau quot   snug top and quite a few other companies make similar products   i believe the cover on my friends car is a snug top   the weather stripping has already let go and it feels really flimsy to hold lift up on the handle   rear gate lifters that are standard in most suv s for the rear window and or rear gate are all that holds this tonneau cover up   it seems that a much more effective way could have been implemented the stock rims look pretty nice   but with one minor deficiency   they come apart   another friend who owns an even crappier   had a rim disintegrate at   mph   he is lucky he missed all of the trees   i don t even want to get started on his truck because he has abused it so much its hard to say whether the problems are his fault or s   my other friend is a well mannered girl that is very gentle with her truck b overall   she did get a pretty good deal on the truck   walking out the door with a brand new semi furnished   barely driven   truck for     a better idea would have been a focus although after reading some reviews   or chevy metro   since she d have the same amount of room   better gas mileage   better back seat   generally everything would be better b alternative   for those looking for a much better truck   a chevy s   with either the    liter vortec or    liter vortec are recommended by me after lots of research   especially the    liter vortec the    liter version of this truck   whom another friend owns   is just as fast as the chevy s    but guess what size engine the chevy has in it     liter vortec   so   for the chevy you ll pay less   get better gas mileage and be able to keep up with v s   not to mention my friend had to replace his engine at    miles b rest in peace   update     well   it is under unfortunate circumstances that i write this update   my friend   whom i ve recently fallen out of friendship with   had a number of problems with her    xlt supercab    liter inline four cylinder automatic    it refused to start on numerous occasions   it was running extremely rough   and the recalls were just too much   it turns out my friend didn t get the warranty i thought she did   they traded this pos in on a   f     liter v with    miles on it will they ever learn   the was trouble from the day it was designed   to the day it was traded in   i feel guilty giving this truck one star   since it doesn t even deserve that b r i p b i little truck   rest in peace i born august    died july   a total of    gentle miles were placed on this yet it was just too much   she couldn t handle it she is survived by two sisters   a     liter   a   avenger   a mother   a   aerostar   and has been replaced by a larger   but probably as troublesome f   she won t be missed   but won t be forgotten may others learn from her mistakes who would i recommend this truck for   my worst enemy br br  
604,0,  update    well   i decided not to keep it   had a flat and the spare tire lock was corroded into place so bad the dealer had to tear out the spare carrier and replace it under warranty the brakes started grabbing pretty bad in the wet and the local dealer couldn t find the problem   the only reason i went to them was because the dealer i felt i could trust basically told me to take my truck somewhere else   didn t even want to do the    mile check   bottom line    read the fine print   s bumper to bumper    mile warranty is only applicable to problems that they find convenient to fix or   in fixing   won t reveal a major   costly screw up on their part unfortunately   there wasn t another truck around that met my expectations after having the   looked at suvs    no go   ended up saying to hell with it and bought a new   honda accord ex v   hey     it could have been a maxxed out taurus   but   well   you know how it goes original    the following opinion is as much a commentary on as on my vehicle i ve got a    supercab xlt sport    l   spd   x which i purchased on      it s been into a couple of local dealers in an effort to get   issues   worked out   i now have about k on it and am debating with myself whether or not to take the hit and dump it   i purchased the as a replacement for my    mazda b cab plus which was getting a little tired after   years and   thou   it still ran ok and got    mph on the road   but was getting pretty rusty and needed a new clutch i have had the fuel gauge sender replaced at about   miles   has real problems with these accross all their vehicles   from what i can tell   problems with the heater doors   the usual wiper switch problem   etc   what has surprised me is that has had some of the same problems for years and doesn t do anything about them   right off the bat   i started getting   mph   i knew that the engine wasn t broken in   it was winter   etc   etc   but    of my driving is on the highway   i wouldn t have been surprised to get low   s   as the epa rating is     took it back to the dealer   who said they   checked it with their computer and it said   mph   pure bs    this truck never has and never will get anything above    with efi   i had expected it to better my carbureted l mazda the real clincher started to show up at about     i started to notice what felt like an abnormal amount of play in the drivetrain   like a bike with a very loose chain   accompanied by a noticeable   clunk   whenever i applied or released the clutch   i brought it to the dealer s attention and   after playing like they didn t understand what i was referring to   said it was   normal   it kept getting worse and i kept bringing it to their attention everytime i took it in for service   the service manager laid out a sheaf of tsb s which he said stated that it was normal for the   clunk   in the   when i pointed out that all of the tsbs only related to xs   he couldn t come up with a justification   thinking it was the rear end   i requested that they check it   they did and declared it to be   normal   more on this later after getting the district rep to check my truck   again    normal   i requested arbitration    i live in illinois and that s the extent of their lemon law   by this time the problem was affecting the shifting and was noticeable to anyone outside the truck   after doing the dance with the s dispute settlement board   it was agreed that i would get a new gearbox   because   after all   the diff was ok   last spring a new   spd was put in my truck   no change   i started going to a dealer in another town   they took a look at the problem and immediately noticed play in the rear end   they found severe wear and ended up replacing everything but the ring and pinion   still no change   a month or so later i stopped by to let them know i was still having problems and that it was now binding up on    shifts   tear down the new tranny and replace synchronizers   quite possibly my old tranny won t have had this problem a couple of weeks ago i took the truck in for its   k service and to determine once and for all just what was going on   the mechanic who had worked on the rear end previously test drove the truck and thought the problem was worse than ever   he called engineering   who basically told him that they weren t going to do anything about my problem   period   end of story   another mechanic there explained that this attitude was the reason he had a japanese suv    he couldn t trust the american vehicles   so here i am   do i keep it   and continue replacing differentials at my own expense   or dump it for another truck   i ve driven almost everything else out there and am even more disappointed   the sport package on my truck provides the x suspension   which   with the rack and pinion steering   provides handling that literally nothing else on the market can match   short of shelling out for a x that i don t need   the x toyotas handle like drunken sailors by comparison   even with the trd package   the dual media    speaker stereo is the best i ve heard in a truck and many cars   the truck is a dream to drive down the highway   until i have to shift  
605,0,  we recently had the chance to drive   of these trucks through budget rentals   we decided to rent the trucks because of the deal they were having   one of them had   miles on it and the other one had    i think having driven two that i can compare really helps my insight into them both of these were the   cylinder automatic transmition with the hard top bed cover   both were the extended cab i liked the amount of room in the cab when there are just   people and the adjustable shoulder straps were a great asset   the seats were very uncomfortable for such a long trip   my husband ended up having to sit on a pillow on the way back with the hard top bed cover   it made it almost impossible to carry much or to carry anything very large   i ran into problems with it twice   once i left the item to home and the second time i loaded what i could and went home and borrowed my mother s truck   a couple of years older and a   cylinder   to haul the rest of the things the truck drove very well on the flat lands   but when we got up in the mountains it had a hard time handling the inclines   we often lost power in it   also   it would often kick out of overdrive by itself   my mother says that hers does not do that   but it could be a feature on this model the air conditioner worked great and i loved the cd player that it had in it   i would have to say that the part that i liked best was the cute little buttons that came on the keychain so that you could lock the doors remotely   that was fun   great for scaring people because if you push it twice   the horn blows   the horn can also blow if you are inside the building and press the horn button   my son tried that one out all in all   i would discourage anyone that wanted to carry alot of things in it   ie use it as a truck   or if you lived in the mountains     
606,0,  oh   i just love my bright red   super cab with the awesome sports package   but i m finding that s famous saying   quot quality is job one quot   is far from the truth   i own an   with almost    miles on it that s much superior to my     i m finding that there s many flaws in the paint   there are several spots where there was dirt under the paint and now the paint has come off   the optional bigger engine with more horsepower as compared to the imports standard engine is way below standards   the cheap look and quality of the inside door panels and door pulls are very disgusting   a few weeks after i bought this truck   the door pull and panel behind it started to peel   i had this replaced and guess what   the second one is doing the same thing   yes   i do love the outside looks of my truck   but i seriously doubt that i ll ever buy another   that s one reason why i just purchased a subaru car instead of a focus   and i have bought s all my life   may i ask   why the price keeps going up and the quality keeps going down   better be careful   because the love of money may just end up hurting you in the long run   it just cost you an     sale with me br br  
607,0,  yes   i am not kidding   after only    miles and none in wd my dealer informed me the weird rattling noise i was experiencing required a new engine   six weeks for the new engine to arrive   two weeks in the shop with no loaner vehicle   i picked up my brand new truck with it s even newer engine to hear the noise again another three weeks at the dealer without a loaner for me   a engineer examined the truck and the customer service rep examined the issues and my request to buy the truck back   the problem was determined inherent warning i have heard from reliable sources   the service people and others on line   this is not inherent    knows about the noise and is refusing at this time to buy the trucks experiencing the noise back    specifically     v wd   just thought you all should know br br  
608,0,  for all you folks who may own a   f    have you ever had a flat tire   if you havn t you just may want to check your jack   yes it should be there but it will do you no good   the owners manual gives you   choices of jacking positions   a primary and a secondary   here is where the problem lies   your jack is too big for the primary point   won t fit there   and not tall enough to use the secondary   won t lift the truck enough to put on the tire   according to the service manager at the local dealer there was a notice on this four years ago   but no fix   i have been fighting for answers for three weeks now   to no avail and no help from   best advice the dealer could give me was buy an aftermarket jack   not the answer i expected   i currently own two fords   a crown vic   and the truck   these will be my last all for the sake of a     jack   service to the customer a concept lost to the   a word to the wise   check this problem out before you too are stranded br br  
609,0,  i had in my head   a great review for the      and then tires were recalled   that alone made me want to return my truck   then to top it all off   i open up the newspaper and lo and behold    another recall    this time it s the seat belts   this leaves me with the thought     quot what next quot i   i feel like i m driving a time bomb   ready to go off   i will share my thoughts and feelings about the       recalls aside   but i really needed to let you know how the recent recalls have affected my opinion on my vehicle   i will never buy another   ever again    the     is a sporty truck with power   i had previously owned a       but with the   model   had jazzed it up a bit   it s an awesome truck for someone who wants to have the ability to haul with a pick up truck   and the easy handling of a car    what i like about my   b they made the hood look more like a ram   i think this gives the truck the illusion that it is actually bigger than it is   the handling is sweet   the truck almost steers itself   you feel as if yo are just guiding the truck in the general direction and it is doing the rest itself   the cab is roomy   we have the extended cab but i noticed they had actually widened the cab from the previous   that i had owned   i love how powerful the engine is   it accelerates so quickly and smoothly   it doesn t feel at all like a truck    what i dislike about my b   well   aside from the fact that my tire could blow at any minute and my seat belt might fail   i really don t dislike my truck   major tongue in cheek here   i do love my truck   i don t the problems i ve had with the tires and now the seat belt so because of that   it makes me wish i had not purchased this vehicle   this is something i strongly dislike about my   honestly   if it weren t for these recalls i d have nothing to put here   the truck is beautiful and handles like a dream   it runs well   and gets decent gas mileage   crud from anymore br br  
610,0,  that i am writing a review of this kind of truck is more or less an accident of fate i rented one for use on a project that required something with a little space for hauling electronic equipment around work sites   it looked pretty good    bright red   shiny it even drove well   handling seemed adequate   and the v engine delivered ok performance   crawling around the vehicle   out of curiosity   revealed that it seemed more maintainable that some of the more luxurious offerings in the truck classes by   it looked like you could get at stuff under the hood   and the suspension running gear even looked truck like on closer examination   i decided that i really did not like the cab arrangement the addition of the little extra doors is questionable   there is no real body mass under the cab roof because of those doors   and my impression was that rollover safety is reduced   behind the front seats there is so little space that all it would be useful for is to store stuff stuff like the flares and emergency road equipment that you might need   you certainly would not want to torture anyone larger than a small child by putting them back there the bed cover seemed a nice touch but the latches were not reliable   and you had to fiddle with them to get the lid locked down   and it did not take long to realize the disadvantage of the lid versus a cap    if you fill the bed up with stuff that wants to get higher than the bed walls   you can t close the lid   payload is thus limited severely   oh and it leaked the thing that really solidified my opinion of this   quot truck quot   was that one morning it simply failed to start   it turned out to be the security system   according to the rental people   when they arrived with a replacement for it and a flatbed to haul it off   it was apparently not an isolated case the appears to be another attempt by a major manufacturer build something that will appeal to people who want a truck   but are economy minded   the corner cutting makes the truck not really desirable if you want any kind of workhorse br br  
611,0,  the pickup with the extended cab is a great size   it is nice looking   and its probably a lot of fun to drive   not that i would really know   here s my experience with one just last week budget has a special on the truck where you can rent one   with a locking bed cover   for    a day   so i booked one   twice   the first time they didn t have any   so they gave me a taurus   see my review at   a href auto review a cb ad prod epinions auto review a cb ad prod a     the second time they had several on the lot   and i got a beautiful new white wd model   i was really looking forward to enjoying this truck for a week   until        i couldn t put my two childrens   child safety seats in the truck b   the has two fold down   diagonally oriented jump seats in the extended cab   they are equipped with an auto retracting lap belt   child seats were completely unusable in this truck   except in the front bench seat   provided i could detach my right arm to make room for the middle mounted seat   this was a surprise to me since i own a toyota xtra cab pickup that is similar in size to the   and in it the properly forward facing jump seats very safely accommodate both child seats in the back the truck started easily   ran well   and was quite comfortable during my ride from the parking space at the rental car pick up area to the loading area where i couldn t put the kids   seats in   and back to the parking space   a total of about   meters   i had to trade the in for a hyundai   now i m no fan of   but hyundais are just embarrassing   i did get the seats in that though so i have to give the a poor rating due to its family un friendliness   its a shame that i never had the chance to take it out on the open road   drive with gusto   and have it break down on me   like just about all fords i ve ever driven have    did you read the taurus review   but to its credit   it seems like such a cool truck otherwise   that if i happen to be renting again at a time when i don t need to use child seats in it   i ll give the another shot br br  
612,0,  previously having owned a   v explorer limited   i was anxious to get into a   explorer as my rental while my supra was getting more than a month s worth of repairs   how did i like my new transportation for the next couple of months   other than having a lot more space than my sports car   it was an overall terrible experience positives   before we dive into the bad stuff   let s start with the stuff that i like    exterior appearance   when you look at this car from the outside   it looks very grand   beautiful   and much nicer than the previous explorer   it combines the more classic looks of the original explorer with the more radically curvaceous looks of the model before this one   it looks more like an suv than a soccer mom vehicle   or a glorified station wagon   it s very nice looking on the outside    interior appearance   did make an attempt to stay with the times and add some strange trim to it   it looks like a silly silvery fake carbon fiber trim on the dash and doors        but for some reason   i like the way it mixed with my silver explorer   and the dark grey interior   it was a nice package    interior space   immediately you notice this is much larger than the previous explorers   not only can you pop up a third row of seats   albeit not as roomy as the middle row   but you can fold down everything in the back to carry large items   i relocated a   gallon aquarium   twin sized mattress and desk   many rounds of friends   stuff from apartments during college semester moving times   etc   it really did have a lot of space   much more than i was accustomed to with the   explorer   good improvement negatives   the above really just sums it up for the new explorer s positives   now        let s go on with the negatives   this will be an easier and longer list to make    flawed seatbelt warning system   in an attempt to encourage drivers to wear their seatbelt all the time   came up with a seemingly good system        after you start driving   if you do not have a seatbelt on        you will hear a very loud and audible alert for about   to   seconds   this reminded me many times to put my seatbelt on   why is it flawed   let s say you wanted to quickly pull from your parking spot to your apartment complex mailbox and run in there for a second   you park   you put your car in park   and you walk in while your girlfriend waits for you        while the car is in park   this seatbelt warning continues to beep and repeat every   or   seconds   for about   to   seconds        also   if you put your seatbelt on immediately once you hear the sound   you get to continue to hear the warning sign for the duration of its time   engineers should ve caused this to automatically disable when the car is in park   and turn off when the seatbelt plugs in   their mistake   maybe it will be corrected in the future   but it is not for the   s   we ll just call it   good game   try again   since this feature can be disabled   and maybe they can correct it in the future or make a recall    seats   the cloth seats have a bad habit of bunching up and catching your clothes   not to mention if you make a relatively sharp turn   without any bucket like characteristics        you will slide the opposite way of your turn   whether it be into the center or the door      counter intuitive locks   i can t tell you how many times i had to unlock the doors   cause all the passengers in the car couldn t figure out which way the door locks work   it is the exact opposite of what you expect   maybe check this out next time you see one   and you will know what i am talking about   it s a switch you push or pull   with no red indicator   and it s kind of a half button thing        it s terrible design    engine   the engine is terrible        i sometimes wonder if there is anything slower on the road   i see a festiva or a chevy metro across the light   and i am thinking    there is no way that can be slower than this thing   it takes me a good long time to get to   mph   also   if you are a speed demon and should drive at high speeds   once you hit the   mph speed limiter   instead of limiting you gently at that speed   it violently cuts fuel jerking the car dangerously slower in a sudden manner   and very roughly   of course   you may not have enough time or road to get going this fast        since it is so slow    off road capability   although it looks capable   the wd version certainly is not   i can t speak for the wd or awd versions   but the wd v is anything but        it s just a jacked up   roomy station wagon    p    fuel economy   you can expect below   mpg   if not right at   mpg on the highway   and closer to   mpg in the city during regular driving   even with this small engine   the epa window sticker fuel economy rating for this is     and seems to be pretty close   in a foreign suv   even with more weight and power   you can get better fuel economy    air conditioning   not only is this air conditioner unbearably loud        in fact   so unbearably loud that when up all the way in the front and the back        you can t hear anyone who is not within a few inches of your ear   makes conversation tough   if not impossible        this unit also takes a long time to cool down in texas heat   which may sound normal   but it takes much longer than older cars i have driven   once you have driven for a while   the unit gets extraordinarily cold   though   but it s very temperamental    cheap trim   the outside trim is extraordinarily cheap   someone closed the rear door relatively hard   and the trim started coming loose   the rental car said this was normal with their explorer        and noted it on the damage before i took the car    stereo   the stereo was terrible   if you turn volume up at all        it starts to crackle and mumble together   this did succeed   however   in breaking my habit of listening to loud music        since at loud volume levels   it doesn t sound like music anymore in the explorer   also   when you forward or rewind   it sounds like it is forwarding rewinding fast at first        although it seems to be going at the exact same x play rate and just jumbling up the sound   it takes a solid   to   seconds to increase the rate of forward rewind   but spends too long doing so        making this a very useless feature   and much more useless than it otherwise could have been    horn placement   this may seem like a small thing   but usually when someone is in need of using the horn        they are in a high stress tension situation   often reacting to an emergency   in this car   you have to remove your hand from the perimeter of the wheel and push on the inside of the wheel   the horn is not accessible with the thumbs in anyway while holding on to the steering wheel   other car manufacturers think of these little ergonomic issues   while apparently does not    braking   the brakes fade very quickly   and if they did this while i was not towing anything        i can only imagine how dangerous and amplified this would be if i were towing a boat       the handling in this car is what i would expect out of an suv        although it feels less prone to roll over than the   version of the car   it certainly feels as if it is going to roll after each curve        maybe this is because of the news attention explorers have recently gotten about rollovers and me just psyching myself out        but   it is definately not a handling machine ride quality is moderate on smooth road   but still has quite a bit of road noise        however   a bump will send you flying higher than you expect i believe that sums it up   although i may have mixed up a few things        but i believe this car is not worth the money   at all        and priced into it is the hype that has come with the explorer since it became the best selling suv a number of years ago   i would look to or a foreign manufacturer for a better built suv        you can even get a lightly used mercedes ml   which will probably be more reliable   for less than this vehicle   and although that is not a perfect vehicle        it is far better value than this one best of luck   and i hope i have been helpful   and i hope i didn t upset any owners of this vehicle        best wishes on your automotive search  
613,0,   b ack when the focus was introduced in late   as a   model it boasted many attributes that surpassed the competition   it had bold styling   a modern interior with plenty of amenities   a good price   and good fuel economy   fortunately for us   the consumers   and unfortunately for other cars such as the toyota matrix   suzuki aerio followed in the focus s footsteps and created an equally if not better automobile to compete b for    the focus sedan comes in   trim lines   the lx   the se   and the zts   while a    sohc engine that produces   hp is standard on the lx and se models   my test se sedan was equipped with a    dohc ztec   cylinder   the zts sedan comes standard with the dohc ztec engine   the    ztec puts out a healthy   horsepower at    rpm and   lb ft of torque at    rpm    transmissions are offered this year   a   speed manual and a   speed automatic   which was equipped on my tester i driving impressions i off the line   acceleration   is disappointing   having the   horsepower ztec engine i was expecting close to the same performance of the old escort zx or the   zx   speed   which had the same engine   the automatic transmission really hampers any sort of rush in power   and when accelerating hard or even slightly hard the engine makes quite a bit of noise   since the focus se s ztec engine gets its peak torque at a relatively low rpm   take offs are adequate   but that s it   nothing exciting   just adequate   the   speed fully automatic transmission plays a big role in this lackluster performance   at times i could have sworn i was driving a car with a   year old transmission   clunking into gear   and odd shifting patterns were common    handling   in the   focus se sedan was quite impressive   as it was back in its introduction year   the focus se remains composed at almost all times   and is surprisingly controllable through hard turns   the suspension made this small sedan very nimble and relatively fun to drive on the twistys    cruising   in this sedan is also quite good   the ride is firm and sporty   yet does not jolt the driver or passengers from their comfortable seating positions   cruising at    mph can be a little loud with the wind   engine and road noise   but unless you are   super picky   it won t bother you enough to change your buying decision   hills are taken with a little strain   the   speed automatic will down shift on steep inclines   and the engine will get quite loud   but you definitely will not be left in the far right lane on those   lane hilly freeways    braking   is average   my tester came with the   so common   front disc rear drum set up with no abs so braking was not a grand offering   but they did do their job of stopping this small sedan with little fuss    fuel economy   is average for a car in this class   the epa rates this car at    mpg with the z tec engine mated with an automatic transmission    interior accommodation i   the   interior   of the   focus se is very edgy new wave   the dash board is very distinctive yet offers good good ergonomics and easy to read instrumentation   even despite not having a tachometer the instrument cluster is well designed with plenty of useful gauges   while the interior of the focus is almost all plastic   the plastic looks good   and is much less plasticy looking many cars in this category   amenities are plentiful with the comfort ztec package       amenities include ac   cc   keyless entry   power windows and locks   tilt steering   an am fm cd player that you will probably want to replace   cup holders   front air bags   and more   the front bucket eats are made of a cheap cloth but are surprisingly comfortable   these seats offer height adjustments and adequate support   room is average   plenty of room up front   but the rear    split folding seats will most likely offer a cramped environment for rear passengers   the focus however does boast plenty of rear headroom   and the trunk is spacious enough for   weeks worth of groceries i exterior innovation i   the   exterior   of the focus sedan remains unchanged since its introduction in    while once considered an   eye catcher   the focus now blends in with a profusion of other look alike cars   i e   suzuki aerio   the exterior   like the interior is very edgy with long triangular headlamps in front and more pudgy triangular tail lamps    price   reliability     warranty i   the   focus se sedan with the comfort ztec package comes to almost      since this is the middle of the year is offer some good apr rates   the focus has been a reliable car since its introduction   and the ztec has been a reliable engine since    if anything does happen to your   focus offers an unimpressive   year     mile bumper to bumper warranty   and an extended warranty at an extra cost looking for a more refined economy car   check out my review on the     a href content     honda civic a      happy car shopping  
614,0,  i recently went out and test drove one of these puppies   and here are a few random thoughts i had from this experience in the event of a head on collision   the car s engine is designed to separate for the car s frame and drop to the ground   i guess consumers don t take too highly to being crushed by the engine it s a snug fit   there is very little space between the seat and the door   the armrest is a stand alone console between the driver and passenger seats   and has a good amount of storage space for cds and other things the back seat has very little legroom   and is a bit cramped   even if the front seat person moves the seat forward   very little room is yielded    there are special child seat restraints and three seatbelts in the back   not exactly a huge family vehicle   but equipped with child safety locks   and other amenities really good power   for such a tiny little car   surprising   in fact   you step on the gas pedal   and it moves   handles very good around corners speaking of corners   what is that loud clicking sound   oh it s just the turn signal   i guess wants to help eliminate those annoying motorists who drive   miles down the road before realizing their blinker has been on the whole time   since the turn signal is about as loud as a mark mcgwire home run swat   i would say they are well on their way to accomplishing this goal all the doors automatically lock once the car exceeds   mph very good vision when driving   you can not see the hood of the car   the wind shield affords a wide view   there is a moderate amount of noise   and you may have to turn up the radio just a bit when accelerating to higher speeds the clutch is very easy to push down on   and transitioning from one gear to other is very smooth with the exception of reverse   it was quite a task to put the vehicle in reverse   you almost have to lift up on the gear stick   it took about a minute and a half to figure this out the first time   and about    seconds to do each time after that there is no rpm gauge   only this annoying light that comes on   telling you when to shift up or down   and usually at the slightest amount of acceleration   i guess thinks i m not smart enough to know when to shift the car gets pretty good gas mileage   at    mpg   but i would expect more from such a small car this car has a lot of truck space   although its much longer than it is deep   when loading the truck   you really have to come forward into the trunk   rather than placing objects down into it   there is a hatch release lever inside that   very useful if you are ever car jacked   and forced into the trunk   while the robber makes his getaway   the back seats also pull down in a       configuration for added capacity overall this is not a bad car   but at a price of about   grand   it is way over priced   i see this car as the exact duplicate of what the escort used to be when it first came out   if you are looking for a car that will get you to where you re going   then this will do   but the price tag is just offensive   and was the main reason we did not buy  
615,0,  i bought this car right after    out of a misguided attempt to show patriotism   after being treated poorly by the vw and honda dealers despite driving up in a brand new saab wagon and willing to pay cash   the dealer was actually the only place willing to deal   that was where the good part of the ownership experience ended   i have had   unscheduled service visits to three different dealers in the    miles i have driven since recieveing my car with   miles on the odomometer   that does not include   cracked windshields due to a faulty design on the windscreen roof intersection   the stereo still does not work other then presets   and   on fm despite   fixes and one replacement   and this is only true when the faceplate does not pop off the radio over any pothole or expansion joint   the alignment is continuously in need of adjustment   the air conditioner refuses to work   the trunk will not stay shut unless slammed so hard that your hand is bruised by the awful spoiler that i ordered my car without   the stablility control does not consistantly work to the parameters specified by but no fualt can ever be found   until   miles rolls around   the engine will run for   seconds with the clutch in   having been at idle and the key out of the ignition   the clutch slips already due to the perevious problem   the parking brake does not work even on slight hills and the car will not always engage first gear when shut off due to the running engine problem   there are numerous rattles in a car where the only thing that is in it most times is the rubberized owners manual   the windshield wiper wear out in   months   the defroster and demister are not up to even virginia winters   and the heated mirrors don t work at all   the rear seatbacks will not consistatly lock upright   and the automatic power window can no longer be overridden   the fix would involve a new door or complete disasembly which would yield more rattles   i average    mpg in maily highway drving with the occasional trip to the golf course or store   this is due to the lack of a sixth gear which causes the engine to run at    rpm at cruising speeds on our higher speed interstates in the south   the paint is easily damaged   and the headlights are basically ineffective on the lowbeam setting   the seats are uncomfortable   engine harsh   clutch downright wierd in it s action   shift light annoining and it s use will yield a stall in most instances   the traction control does not work and in snow actually needs to be defeated in order to be able to start forward motion   it locks the drive wheels and digs them in to the snow when there is some freeze up overnight   and the ski rack is awful   the dealer service for the is abismal at all locations   and loaner cars for major waranty repairs that take days are non existant even at the selling dealer   a   blue oval   one at that   my friend with a   volvo   with    miles on the origonal engine   transmission   clutch   and belts will not drive my car due to the reliablilty issues and feeling of driving around in a tin can   her car has a rear door held to the car and hinges by duct tape and bondo   and the   leather wraped steering wheel   must be covered with bionic cow hide  
616,0,  i bought my   aerostar used in march   with k miles on it   it was an xlt extended model   with the    v   it did not have dual air conditioning and that was a big mistake   the a c could not keep the large van cool in the summer no matter what   the van was bought to haul civil air patrol search and rescue teams as well as an explorer scout post   it was an excellent road vehicle   very comfortable for long distance driving   problems began to appear with the fiberglass tailgate cracking at k miles   the door glass would rattle when you shut the doors   and the sliding door leaked badly   the side windows leaked despite being replaced twice by the dealer   the carpet was threadbare by k miles but to be fair   that wasn t helped by carrying people and cargo constantly mechanical repairs were very frequent   with the dreaded ecm iv ignition module having to be replaced every k miles   by the time i sold the van at k miles   it was on its third alternator   second water pump   third power steering pump   and the transmission was slipping   this was after exclusive highway driving   not much stop and go city driving   the van sheetmetal was very prone to dents   with the large flat sides not having much reinforcement   for some reason the headlights could never maintain a proper adjustment either   by k miles the     vulcan   v was burning oil   i tried to maintain this van to the factory guidelines and changed oil every   miles but it just kept breaking down   the power steering pump moaned and groaned constantly   which apparently is a common problem   the engine in these vans is very difficult to access and work on for you do it yourselfers out there be forewarned   one thing that i did like was the rather low lift over height compared to fullsize vans and the chevy astro   not as low to the ground as a caravan but close   the rear seats are really darned heavy   close to   pounds and require   people to remove   the velour upohlstery is a lint and dog hair magnet which never ever comes clean   all types of clothing stick to the seats from static electricity the exhaust system lasted k miles exactly   i had it replaced twice with factory parts   a bit disappointing on the quality there   brakes   the aerostar will eat a set of front brake pads every k miles   almost as bad as a full size van   as far as driving it   the steering is responsive   the brakes are a bit soft but the abs worked very well   acceleration isn t bad with the    but i wish it had the      the gauges are large and easy to read and the controls are decent except for the power window and door locks   which are right next to your knee and you will often hit them when you least expect it    i m a big person so maybe it s just me   the factory radio has a decent tape player but a horrible fm   spend the    and get an aftermarket radio on all fords   dealer service wasn t bad   just expensive   there is a dealer here in louisville   ky that sells trucks vans exclusively and they know their stuff   very honest   the other dealers   repairs were okay but they were pretty uncaring especially on warranty repairs   i used to be a volunteer firefighter   and this is not a good vehicle to run code   with due to the soft brakes and extreme body roll   plus difficult blindspot vision   in the rain i never felt really safe making a hard emergency run with the aerostar   just my    cents worth if you happen to use your vehicle for that purpose   overall   the aerostar was so so   it was slightly more reliable than my   taurus   which was the worst thing i ve ever driven  
617,0,  i never owned an american car   i bought this   zx because my   year old son decided to work for a dealership and a   he gave me a great price and b   i didn t want his boss to think he couldn t sell a car to his own mother   i ve had it a year and half now and i have to say that i wish i had my mazda protege back   not that i ve had any problems with it so far but the biggest problem has been the noise   it is loud   between the road noise and the air conditioner i have to turn the radio to dangerous levels to hear the music   and speaking of the sound system    radio cassette   well   i ve heard much better   it just doesn t have any pizzazz   the engine runs hard   even when i m in th gear    manual   i find myself re shifting and trying to get into a higher gear because it sounds as if the engine is laboring   about   days after i got the car   i spent about an hour looking for the trunk release button   i finally figured out that there wasn t any   the only way to open the trunk was either with the key or with the remote trunk release button   except   both methods require that the ignition be turned off unless you use a second key   so that when i drop my partner off at the airport   i can t open the trunk to remove the luggage with the car running also   it s supposed to be a   gallon gas tank but i feel like i m at the gas station all the time   the car is cramped in front   i m    quot   and i have to pull the seat up pretty far in order to reach the pedals   but the further you sit up   the closer your head is to the sun visors   they seem to be right in my face i don t know   it s not a bad car really   but all in all it s pretty much a car that even a mother couldn t love     
618,0,  i bought a   escort sedan brand new   it was a nice looking car   and was affordable for me   a divorced mother   it had all the important options available   had four doors   and was easy to handle on the road   i loved the escort s appearance   the sound system   i had the premium sound option   and the comfort of the seats   i hated the leaky trunk   i took that car in every few months to have the trunk fixed   but still ended up with a moldy trunk   moldy stroller   and nowhere to put my groceries if i wanted them to stay dry   after eighteen months of repairing the trunk without positive outcome   i finally talked into helping me into another car   they would only help me out of the still topsy turvy loan if i went into another   i did so   but not an escort again   i am too afraid that i ll end up with another unrepairable leaky trunk   that brings me to the biggest problem with escorts   anyone knowledgeable about the auto market will tell you that they do not hold their value well they are a dime a dozen   driving my escort never gave me too much trouble   even in snow   it was easy to steer   inexpensive to maintain   was good on gas   and still looked nice   its the perfect car for anyone wanting a new   comfortable car for a decent price   just watch the trunk br br  
619,0,  this was the first car i got when i turned    and i haven t liked it one bit since then   sure it s cheap   and it gets good gas mileage   but it is not comfortable and does not handle well under bad conditions   this past winter i went out one day to go get some baby food for the new baby while my mom was still at work   it was snowing out but i thought nothing of it at the time   no more then   feet away from my house i go to hit the brakes   and they lock up as my car goes sliding into a ditch   the back seats in this car are very uncomfortable also   i recently was going to take it on a trip to niagra falls   about a   hour drive   but decided against it because anyone in the backseat would be very uncomfortable the whole ride   i wish i could trade it in and get a new car br br  
620,0,  my zx   i have had mine zx for a little over   years and less than    miles   i have disliked it greatly from the get go   exterior i really like the exterior   it is sleek and a little stylish   a   door coupe with a little attitude interior a lot left to be desired   the dash is cool but impractical   there is no easy way to upgrade the stereo or any other in dash component since it comes in that nice oval box   the cup holders are good for small drinks   they are not good for the standard oz fast food drink   large cups hit the controls for the ac   the interior is a little cramped feeling if there is more than the driver in the car   the back seat is impossible to get in and out of   on the plus side the back seat is roomy the center console is small and does not hold cds very well   the door pockets are small and pathetic   the zx does leave a lot to hope for in the way of storage inside the car performance the zx has a lot of get up and go   this will be great for you if you do mind feeling like you are riding a tightly bound rubber band   the gear shift has also been stiff and unmanageable   it has just gotten worse after time   it is very difficult to go into reverse   complaints i have had a lot of problems with this car   the brakes continually popping even after that got replaced twice   the door seals and trunk seals leaking   have fixed fixed only a dozen times so far   if you drive the car with any speed the gas mileage is much less than the sticker claims it should be   on top of this everything seems to rattle   i have never had such a loud little car   overall i would not suggest the zx   may be it has gotten better since    i did get one of the originals   it was only on the lot about    a day before i bought it     
621,0,  i purchased this vehicle brand new in    when it had about   miles on it   it was in the shop within the first week   with rattling noises coming from under the hood and the emergency brake light wouldn t go off   just recently   i was rear ended at a stop sign   the rear bumper of my escort was completely totalled   and there was damage to the frame of the car as well   the person that hit me suffered only a broken headlight   she probably hit me at about   mph   but her car miraculously did not sustain the kind of damage as my escort did   for the external damages   repair estimates are     they haven t taken the car apart yet to determine the estimate to repair the frame of the car   you would think that a car could handle a crash of this speed without too much damage   but it wasn t the case   the body of the car was found to be pretty weak in this kind of crash   suffice it to say   i will not be purchasing another escort   i don t feel safe in it at all update   this crash was at   mph   and the damage ended up costing over      thankfully the other driver was insured and i didn t have to pay for it     
622,0,  i bought the   escort sedan sport when i moved out of state for law school   needing a mode of transportation   i opted to buy an inexpensive car to use for the   years while i was away at school instead of driving my family car back and forth across the country each term at the time of my purchase   the economy was still strong and not many car dealers in southern california were willing to sell their cars at a discount price   mitsubishi wanted   k for their mirage   toyota wanted   k for a corolla   honda wanted   k for a civic and even wanted   k for a prism   it was insane   i definitely did not want to spend more than   k for a   point a to point b   car   so finally   i saw a brand new   escort sedan sport on   sale   at the local dealer for a little less than   k anyway   the first month of driving my car   i thought that there was something wrong with the car   in southern california   there is a lot of highway driving   even for short distances   i was having problems accelerating onto the freeway it took me a good minute or two to go from   to    it was ridiculous   i took the car in and they did a tune up on the car and could not find anything wrong   apparently the car s acceleration just sucks   period   there is nothing   sport   about this car    hp   it felt more like    my old   hp   oldsmobile firenza had more pep than this car   i think the   door zx s have a better engine and has more pep   but the sedan is very sluggish and being in warm temperatures   if you turn on the air conditioning while the car is climbing uphill forget it   your car will actually decelerate even with your foot pressing the gas pedal all the way to the floor   also   if you have   adults in the car   forget about trying to accelerate at any good pace   the car will basically be maxed out at about   mph without making horrible noises and shaking   even though the speed limit in ca is   after about a year of owning this car   the power window started sticking   that had to be replaced   but it was under warranty   then a few months later   a fan in the air conditioning unit broke and was also replaced under warranty   also you can t upgrade the stereo on this car unless you buy an expensive adapter harness kit because the stereo is integrated into their heating cooling controls   who designed this thing all i have to say is that i was very happy when i graduated law school and sold this car   i had it listed in the paper and auto trader for weeks before it sold for a couple thousand below blue book  
623,0,  we got our second escort a few years ago   but i m not exactly sure why   they are very light   but the engines are not very strong   if you get four or five full grown people in the car   it definately struggles going up big hills   it seems very much like a golf cart in the way that it feels and drives   it zooms around town and handles well   but it isn t anything special   some of the advantages are that it is very reasonably priced and it has very good gas efficiency so it is pretty cheap to keep running   this car is good for someone in a city who will not have much to lug around nor have many passengers to drive around     
624,0,  i bought this vehicle when my last car died i probably should have spent more time researching the car and the dealership but i needed a car   my last car was a used one so i figured that this time i would go ahead and spend the extra money and buy a new one   worst mistake of my life   i had picked the car up with only   miles on it from the dealership   miles from my test drive it was in the shop within a week from when i purchased the vehicle   it was a   speed standard i had just thought that it was just a problem with the gears grinding but it turned out to be serious there were problems with the clutch   the transmission the brakes   the radio and the cassette player the dealership that i bought the car from was   minutes away so i brought it to the one that was in my city they charged me for looking at my car everything was still under warranty money that i never saw back i was accused by the other dealership of not knowing how to drive a standard and intentually damaging my new vehicle   no one goes out and buys a brand new standard and not know how to drive one   needless to say i was considerably unhappy so i contacted the itself and they weren t any help either they would nt replace the car or offer me a discount or even an apology what i got was we have to try to fix the problem first to this day the car still is nt right last week my heater went out do to a hose coming undone second time its been fixed something else i found annoying   the bumper is plastic   back to my other gripes about the car i was way overcharged   i was charged for things that i found out after were supposed to be standard on my car i was charged    for a cigarette lighter and ashtray   i don t smoke i was charged extra for the cassette player i was charged extra for the non keyless entry and on top of being charged extra i was told that i had to go through a particular finance   a whole new problem and since i didn t have a co signer i was charged a few thousand dollars extra my credit report shows a co singer so not only did i not get a good car for a good deal i ca nt even trade this one in until its payed off and worthless not that it really isn t right now i ca nt rate this car low enough i would not recommend this car to my worst enemy br br  
625,0,  i used to drive a fantastic little   chevy nova   a toyota in a chevy suit   but it finally got too old and wobbly   i went on line to research replacement cars   i considered the toyota corolla   honda civic and focus   but ended up with the zx for a number of reasons when i bought it   it was   years old and had    miles on it   but i got it through the certified pre owned vehicle web site   it came with a no haggle price of     and a   month warranty   at that price   the best i could do at toyota was a three year old corolla with   k my zx is silver and pretty cool and sexy looking for such a cheap car   i drive it back and forth to work every day and cram my two kids in the back at weekends   i get to work much faster now    the car wants me to drive above   mph at all times   but at that speed the gas mileage is only about   mpg and the car is noisy   the kids say it s even noisier in the back the car is pretty comfortable for me    i m a medium sized woman    but my    quot   husband doesn t like to drive it for more than    hour at a time   and when i had to put a couple of grown men in the back last week   i wasn t sure i d ever get them back out i think the trunk is generous and the cup holders are fine   but the glove box is way too small    once you put the owner s manual in there   you only have room for three cassettes and a kleenex i ve had the car for a year   and once last year some kind of pin in the axle or wheel fell out    i ground to a halt and had to get towed   but they fixed it for free and that s the only problem i ve had br br  
626,0,  i bought my tempo about two years ago    since then it has driven    miles more or less    i bought this car because i needed a car to commute   miles to school in    so after some haggling my father bought me my tempo gl at a used car lot    my car has not given me as much trouble as i thought it was going to    so far i have replaced the alternator    the brakes    the battery and done basic maitanence    i hope that this car will hold out for another year    but that is not guaranteed    i feel like a ton of things are about to wrong with it    i recommend this car to commuters on a budget    i do not recommend this car if you want to pick up chicks    its not a very attractive car        
627,0,  is this suv for you the older style bronco      is most suitable for someone who has a working knowledge about cars is prepared to do a little maintenance   this car makes a better hobby than daily driver   however   there is plenty of room and it is very simple under the hood so it is a good car to learn on if you are not confident with your automotive abilities   it s a great attention getter on the street and performs very well off road   it can weave through narrow obstacles yet has a long enough wheel base that it isn t too   quot squirelly quot   on the road   it is nice because the hard top is removable   but very heavy   and can provide the open air feeling of a convertible   original equipment   especially body panels   can be a challenge to find for a decent price but there are many after market products available if you d like to modify it   in my opinion   the model fills the void between a jeep and full size suv   what do i look for when buying an older bronco   it depends on what you d like to use it for   if you have any intention at all of   quot fixing it up quot   one day   the most important thing you can look for is a rust free body   body panels are expensive and tough to find   a good rule of thumb is to check the floorboards under drivers feet    if they are rusted through move on to another vehicle   be aware that many people put sheet metal over the rusted area to cover it here   if you are looking to use it off road make sure to buy one with the dana   in the front end and   quot large bearing quot   rear end   all models came with a   inch rear end   the large bearing has stouter brake drums and wheel bearings   many models came with a dana   front end   the dana   has many drawbacks   parts are hard to find   it s unique to broncos   it is more costly to upgrade to disk brakes   and they are not as strong   however   the dana   is sufficient for daily driving and occasional off road use   the other main consideration is power steering and power brakes    these options were primarily available on the    models   there are many after market kits you can buy to upgrade to these options but these are pricey and can be tedious to install   i see non power assisted broncos as being better for off road use because there are fewer things that can break off road and leave you stranded   however   daily street driving is compromised without these luxuries   especially if you install larger tires   a bronco with power steering and power brakes will bring a premium   finally   you ll probably want a bronco that has an automatic transmission    even if you us it off road   the manual transmission equipped on broncos was a   speed   on the steering column   and it often has inoptimal gearing for driving off road   there are many after market adapters available for upgrading to a   speed manual transmission from an older truck but his can   again   be pricey and a tedious conversion if you want power   find one with a   cubic inch engine   not only is this a v   but the components allow for the   quot bolt in quot   addition of a   windsor if the   is not enough for you in summary   the premium bronco will have a no rust   dana    large bearing    inch brake drum v s    inch   power steering and power brakes   automatic transmission and a   cubic inch   if you want to own the bronco that everyone will envy and will be less costly to upgrade or restore in the future   don t buy one without these options   however   if you have a specific use you plan on using your bronco for   buy the one that will best suit your needs   what are the pros of owning an older bronco every other bronco owner you meet will wave at you   it s almost like joining an elite club   they perform very well off road   especially with the right modifications   after market components are abundant   you get a lot of attention driving these cars   they are fairly simple under the hood and are practical to fix off road and under poor conditions   the front and rear drive lines are interchangable in case one is damaged   there are many after market parts available   they are a very fun suv    and one of the first ever made   there is ample sheet metal and provide great protection in an accident but make sure a roll bar is installed   what are the cons they are expensive to maintain   especially if you take them off road   even thought hey have a longer wheelbase than a jeep they still have a stiff ride on the highway   expect   quot bump steer quot    steering wheel will move when you hit a bump   especially if you own one with no power steering and larger tires   body parts are scarce   they are prone to rolling over under extreme driving circumstances    never drive one without a roll bar     
628,0,  being a mechanic by nature my first reaction to this suv is to stay away from it and i will tell you why   first and most importantly to me is what this vehicle holds in store for me or any consumer how much will it cost for repairs large or small    well i will tell you that if properly maintained you will get a long life out of these but   when it comes time for suspension work or even exhaust work you can expect a large bill when the work is complete and the garage has had your suv for the whole day   suspension parts wear quickly on these for some reason weather or not you take care of them   for instance the ball joints and tie rods are non greaseable and weather or not you go off road with this you will need to replace them generally at about k miles   if you were to replace all   ball joints on this vehicle be prepared to spend between   and   dollars   in my opinion these parts should last at least k maybe even k if the vehicle is well maintained   exhaust repair will end up costing you about    due to rotting tail pipes and mufflers    at least in this part of the country   on the plus side of this vehicle is its handling and fuel economy and the comfort level is high i just do nt like to repair suspension that soon and if you put off repairing the suspension remember your tires are next   over all with its decent fuel economy and roomyness it is an ok vehicle   my personal preferance is the chevy s series in my experience these vehicles last longer     
629,0,  what you are about to read is based on my recent test drive of the   escape   we went to our local dealer to see if anything had changed between the   model and the    unfortunately   very little changed   it is still a x minivan   in fact the only visible change we noticed is that the limited edition escapes were a bit cheaper than the previous year   down about    dollars depending on what options you choose once i first got in the vehicle i did feel alot of comfort and room   after checking out my surroundings i did notice that the head room was incredible the front head room is    in   and the rear head room is    in   the seats are very comfortable   but pretty boring in styling   they were just a plain tan color just average   the seats are very easy to fold down and add extra cargo space once layed flat after a couple minutes sitting in the escape   i really felt as if i was in a caravan of the late   s   it just has the feel of a mini van   i was very disappointed with the center console   it is nothing more than a huge pit   there is nothing there to really hold any cd s   spare change   whatever it may be   it was basically a nd glove box   it is excellent storage for whatever you may keep in there   it is just not designed to hold anything imparticular   the dashboard is pretty basic and boring   nothing really sticks out once i started the car up i could tell the power of the engine    hp   kinda roared once i starting it up   upon trying to put the vehicle in drive i noticed that the gear selector is on the column   didn t we phase this out yet   very outdated   once i left the lot   i noticed right away that the engine had zip   but was noticeably louder than other vehicles   the vehicle has excellent pick up   pulling out was very simple and the car like handling is a plus the escape i drove had very few options   basically a stripped model with floor mats   and mud guards   the options it did have like power windows   power door locks   etc   were all placed basically the same place as any other vehicle   and they are all within comfortable reach of the driver   radio had some definite volume   but you need to so you can hear music over the road noise   more engine noise on city streets   but once you get on the highway the road noise kind of drowns out the engine noise once i finally got on the highway and pulled out on the on ramp   i was ready to take the car back to the dealer   the engine though peppy is extremely loud as well as the road noise of the vehicle   i found myself talking much louder than normal to be able to communicate with my passenger   very disappointing with the road noise   but speed and handling were very nice   more car like than most suv s the   escape is pretty basic   and a little bit boring   the v   engine had more than enough power   but they need to build something around it   car like handling is a plus   but the interior needs to be more quiet   road noise isn t a big deal when you drive alone   but once you have friends and family in the vehicle it can be down right annoying summary it is definitely one of the lower priced x vehicles   but there are other options out there   i would suggest looking to other makes and models   as the salesman told me   all the fathers are buying these for their daughters   so maybe the road noise is an outta sight outta mind kinda thing   good luck in your suv searches  
630,0,  i bought this vehicle for the room that it has   seats   with extra room in the back for anything else you need to carry   what i learned and know hate about this vehicle is the sliding door   i have had the door into a least a dozen times in the past year   the top roller on the door pops out and the door is just hanging there   it makes it unable to close or open properly   it would seem to me that this should make the car unable to be drivable but as long as they fix it and it runs a month before it falls off again then it s ok   in the mean time it is a pain and a hassle   i would think that they could bond it or make it fixed permantly   but that does not seem to be the case   beware drivers who are thinking of buying a mini van with a slider just had to take it to the shop march th    the hinesville department and the body shop that they contracted have finally told me that there is nothing else they can do   they have replaced everything on the door except for the door itself   now what do i do   i have to carry a cresent wrench with sockets every where i go my warranty has expired now   and they have made sure that i have gone over the miles that they warrany there work   basically i got taken big   i want to warn every owner   make sure you get paper work for all the work that is done   even if there shop fixed it at there expense   it is the only proof that you ever brought it back to there shop if any one has a suggestion please leave me a comment   if you know how to get out of a contract let me know i still owe   more years of payments on this vehicle br br

people who are thinking about buying a   crown victoria    or a mercury grand marquis and for people who have this large barge   knowing that for most people who are reading this neither apply   i will try to keep it as brief as possible   however   i do have an abundance of information that i will try to shoehorn between now and the attack b you look young for a grandfather b the   model is the last of the old school crown victorias   the more contemporary model arrived in early   as   s   you have seen the ones i am talking about   they look like a mixologist put a   crown victoria in a blender with a taurus   giving it a more rounded off appearance   the previous generation before the   s had not changed that much in looks since    yes the late   s   i feel this has a causal effect on the grandpa car image that this car has   the split bench seats perpetuate this image b i see   in your past   problems when ordering at the drive through b would you like some information that is very useful at cocktail parties   any crown victoria owner   all models up to    has probably had problems with the power windows and i am no exception   however   i fixed it myself   so i can give you additional information that others can not   the power windows use a nylon spool that breaks and tangles around the regulator and inside the door   the local dealer wanted    to fix my drivers side window   so i fixed it myself with a part from an extra door   see   when cars attack   section   this was a hassle   but creates less anxiety than handing a cop your licence and insurance information through the back window   not to mention talking to customs when driving to montreal   do it through your back window   and you are sure to be asked to   pull to da side   now   if you meet someone at a cocktail party with a crown victoria you can magically predict that they have had problems with their windows b jiffy lube this   buddy b vickey had greaseable upper control arm bushings   this is a nice feature   however it is really hard to find a service station that will do it for you the wheels must be turned to access the zerk fittings   meaning two more steps for the people who service your car make sure that someone does this at least ever two years   at the absolute most   or you will have an expensive repair b other problem spots   for every single mile i put on this car      i had problems with the egr passages   egr stands for exhaust gas recirculation   which sounds good on paper   but means big problems for people who have to get their exhaust checked upon inspection   egr runs your exhaust back through your engine to burn some of the pollutants that otherwise would be released into the air   and if it is not working   you will not pass emissions the air conditioning uses r   refrigerant which is no longer being manufactured   it is still available at a current rate of     per pound   to recharge   five pounds of r   is utilized you do the math   it isn t cheap neither is the alternative   you can convert your crown victoria to the new r a refrigerant at a cost of     which includes parts and labor other problems include   but are not limited to   the alternator and the windshield wiper pump   not to mention the imprecise suspension   vicky consumed alternators like a monkey eats bananas for the love of god   if you have this car   track all parts you buy for it   it is a good idea to ask to see the used parts   on any car   before work starts on it   even if you have no idea what the part is b use the force   luke b being from vermont   it is hard not to be a red neck when dealing with cars   but it is a constant battle   as you can tell   sometimes the urges are too strong to win the altercation   that is why i installed a k amp n air filter in my car   this is a highly crafted air filter that is reusable   just wash it   oil it   put it back in   and enjoy the extra horsepower you now have   in retrospect   this was a sound investment   i also installed   underdrive pulleys   in my crown victoria   which replaces the water pump and alternator pulleys with ones that   underdrive   several of the accessories   freeing up engine horsepower   i know you are thinking this is why i had to replace the alternator often   three times   however two of them happened before i made this adjustment   so i ruled out this assumption after these two simple adjustments   i realized i did not need to change the muffler to a high performance one   as so many people do when trying to get more horsepower out of their car this car was very fast   advancing from   to   miles per hour in   seconds before the adjustments and   seconds after   however   the acceleration of this car is more noticeable at highway speeds   where these adjustments had the most impact   on the highway this car is a bad boy b when cars attack   i know your eyes are getting blurry   and if i haven t lost you so far   i thank you for reading please let me conclude with this story   after calling aaa once my car would not start   they sent a tow truck to tell me some misinformation   he said it was one thing   and i found out it was another problem   down the road   i found out the complication the hard way   it was a bone chilling morning    degrees   in vermont   and i went out to start vickey so she could warm up   and i could get my things together inside the house i started the car   got out and shut the door the previous night i pulled up close to the garage   so i had to walk behind it on my way inside   just as i did   the reverse lights illuminated and it lunged toward me   as i jumped to the side   it slowed down enough for me to open the passenger side door i realized the wheels had been turned to the left   making the car continue to come toward me   after i opened the door   my self preservation function kicked in   and i decided to spring away and i watched as she drove down my driveway i can not describe the feeling of watching your car drive without a driver   just as vickey completed a   degree angle   the passenger side door caught on a metal fence   twisting it to touch my front quarter panel as it scraped along the diamond metal fence   it straightened out and proceeded to travel down my driveway just imagine the next time you start your car   what would happen if you turned your steering wheel all the way to the left   shifted into reverse   and let go of the break   now   picture what would happen to someone if they happened to be standing to the right side of your car   as i watched vicky drive away   sparking along the fence   she slammed against the last metal pole on the fence   and with a brief upward motion   she rested at her final destination   to make things worse   i had just replaced that door after getting broadsided   with no injury to my passenger   by a grand am   i put the original door on it after pounding it out   and sold it at auction for     good riddance     
632,0,  this is essentially a re hash of the crow vic opinion that i wrote earlier i was driving a   honda crx that was about to die   and needed something quickly   so i hit a dealer specializing in used police cars figuring i d get something inexpensive and interesting   i picked up a   police package   formerly owned by the connecticut state police since the car was only going to be driven a few hundred miles a week   price was the main concern when the car was running   it was a lot of fun   good acceleration   lots of   quot luxury quot   features that the honda didn t have   but it lacked cruise control   so long drives were tiring   and dangerous if there were too many radar traps   because of the size of the car and the engine   it was easy to creep up to   mph   i did get interesting responses from other drivers   and didn t have to wait behind someone to get out of the passing lane   unfortunately   the bad outweighed the good the police package was the only crown vic in   with a carburetor not only was it a carburetor   but an engineering nightmare known as a variable venturi   the one i had was going bad   the local dealer wouldn t touch it   saying that the best that they could do was replace it   at a cost of     i did manage to find a mechanic who specialized in them and only charged    to rebuild the one i had eventually   all of the major systems on the car were replaced   one at a time   just to keep the car operating   it is also the last year for the   cui engine when it was running   the handling wasn t particularly good   the breaking was poor   and the ride was soft   i can t even imagine what a standard crown vic would drive like   the acceleration was awesome   but at less then   miles per gallon   stepping on the gas was an expensive proposition if you re looking for an inexpensive luxury car   don t stop off at the local used police car salesman   the sticker price isn t even close to what it will cost in the end br br  
633,0,  well   on a road trip to st   george   utah i rode in one for   hours on each trip   there and back   it was a base model f   with a stick and base wheels and no rear bumper the ride was pretty smooth   the suspension was really soft   i don t think this one was made for towing or heavy duty work   the interior however   wasn t very roomy and comfortable   the seats were rigid and not very comfortable as for speed   it was fairly good at keeping its momentum on hills although it did lose some speed   i think it would keep its speed better than most other cars with less than   horse power   it wasn t that great on acceleration with the manual gearbox the transmission was not very nice either   when you shift it and let the clutch out it jerks the truck no matter how smoothly you perform it   it is also geared way too high   it can t put any power to the wheels when it needs it like in acceleration if you are going to buy a new f   then get the one with bucket seats   automatic transmission   stiff suspension and a towing package   that way you will get some torque going to the wheels when you want it   the bucket seats would make it a more enjoyable ride   the and gmc seem to ride more smoothly and be able to take more heavy duty work br br  
634,0,  i owned the truck for almost   years then i sold it   mechanically the truck felt good   allthought it lacked a little bit of power and was bad on gas   i would go for the    next time   i loved the truck it had a great ride for a large truck   i had the off road package which gave it bigger tires and higher suspension   but the overall quality was not good   under   years old and the truck was rusting in many different spots   this was not just mine doing it   i talked to many other owners that had the same problems   also the sheetmetal on the doors cracked and the paint chipped off   this happened around the window frame   and this is on every   and up f    i also read they are having paint problems like they did in the early   s paint on the top surfaces are letting go   not happy with the quality and was worried about the future of this truck   since i did not lease   i financed i did not want to own a beat up old truck after   years or so br br  
635,0,   sho   is supposed to stand for   super high output   i personally wouldn t call   hp from a    liter dohc v   super high output   but i guess thinks thought it was worthy of the name   its   horsepower v and good road manners means that this can almost hang   in out right performance   with the finest sedans from its european and japanese rivals   such as the bmw i and the acura legend i driving impressions i   the latest   sho   is much more manageable to drive than the original models   although sadly to say   much slower   and nowhere near as fun   unfortunately the sho is fwd   rwd with an added traction control would have been a nice feature   the   suspension   set up provides a comfortable highway ride   while keeping the car flat through fast turns   letting you really enjoy this small v   the only problem here is that rattles seem to be abundant throughout the cabin over slight bumps   or at high speeds   throttle response is good   and there is power all the way up to the    rpm   red line   it can go    mph in less than   seconds   according to specs    whoopi di woooo   you might say   but this is very fast for a family sedan costing less than     for the    model year    l ike the sho s first v engine   the    liter   all alloy    degree v is a collaboration between and yamaha   each concentrates on its own strengths   so builds the bottom end   with balancer shaft to keep it smooth at high rpm   which is then shipped to japan for the   valve per cylinder yamaha twin over head cam heads to be fitted   although torque peaks at    rpm     is available at an almost idle    rpm    u nlike s other v powered cars   the sho has its engine mounted transversely   and driving the front wheels   it does this through a   speed fully automatic transmission   unfortunately a manual is not available the two electronically controlled shocks and multi link rear   suspension   give relatively good handling   despite being an all alloy engine   the    is heavier than the previous   before       and     horsepower engines i interior accommodation i   the   interior   of the taurus sho is quite luxurious   the comfortable interior is designed to compete with rivals from bmw and audi   sorry   but the sho does not compete in this category if you ask me   the plastics in the sho are of marginal quality   and the seating feels cheap   and offers nowhere near as much support as the seats in the bmw i   the sho does however have good ergonomics   and tons of standard amenities   power sunroof   power door locks etc   comes with an ice cold ac   and power seats with lumbar support i exterior innovation i   some say this car is   smooth and sleek   i say the sho s   exterior   design looks more like a big   egg on wheels than anything else   this design never grew on me   in fact   on the contrary i disliked it the more i saw it   the only thing this car has going for in the looks department is the dual exhaust   has changed this design for the   model year   unfortunately the sho trim line did not return   making the regular   horsepower    duratec v the top of the line power plant i pricing i   the   price   is getting pretty low for these cars   nobody really wanted the sho beings that the competiton offered much more value   i e   the grand prix gtp   these cars are not   that fast   they have good   but not spectacular interiors   downright ugly exterior looks   they get relatively poor gas mileage   are not on the top of the list for reliable cars   yet has the audacity to stick a     dollar price tag on it   i don t blame the public for not wanting to pay that price   a   model however now can be found for around     or less   typical taurus resale value i conclusion i   because of the poor resale of the   taurus sho these cars are now an exceptional buy   if you are looking for a cheap family sedan on the used market the taurus sho does offer good bang for the buck b other cars to consider b i    chevy monte carlo   a href content   epinions content   a    my review    chevy lumina z    bmw i    saab   aero    stratus    intreped    thunderbird v    mercury cougar    toyota camry v    honda accord v coupe   happy car shopping  
636,0,  preface in august    i was driving my one month old pontiac grand prix gtp daytona   pace car   please read my review on that   when some bozo in a honda accord pulled out in front of me   i was not happy   nobody was hurt seriously   i broke his car literally in two   his insurance paid for the     repair to the front end of my limited edition car   i ll bet they were really happy with him   his insurance also paid for a rental while my car was in the shop   from september   to december     no joke   this rental car i had was a   taurus the taurus since i had this car for   and a half months   i feel kind of like i owned it   here is what i thought of it the good what good can i say about this car   well   for starters   it was fairly comfortable   at least in the    driver s seat   i say fairly   because even though i ve been much more comfortable in a car   i never got sore during my   minute commute each way every day   the wheel and controls were comfortable as well   the gas mileage was pretty good   it was a fairly quiet car   too    pretty solid   and not a lot of wind noise   that surprised me   the car was also easy to maneuver   not bad for a low end family sedan the bad i didn t   want   a low end family sedan   i wanted my hp loaded out road rocket back   so i always compared it to my car which was slowly coming back together in the shop   in that aspect   the taurus   weaknesses become very apparent   it is quite weak   that s probably why there s so little wind noise     my taurus accelerated like a small   cylinder despite the fact that it was a   cylinder   this was a problem more than once merging on the highway   even worse    in fact   the   worst   problem i had with this car    was the rear visibility   three times i almost hit a car coming up on my left   i never rely on mirrors   i always turn my head to look over my shoulder before changing lanes   when i turned my head to look back over my left shoulder   all i could see was the window post   the visibility was terrible   and i advise anyone who has one of these cars to be extra careful when changing lanes   furthermore   i just didn t care for the styling   the ovoid theme was carried way too far   making this car look just as ridiculous inside as outside   the oval radio console must make upgrading the stereo a nightmare   the oval inside door handles were very flimsy the verdict if you re used to well equipped fast cars   you won t like this one   it ain t   if you re looking for a comfortable family sedan for a fairly inexpensive price   you might want to check it out oh yeah   and those of you who have taurus shos and think they are fast   well okay   maybe   that s not what i reviewed   besides   my gtp will make an sho look like it s standing still    br br  
637,0,   strengths    the taurus has an excellent ride quality   with the upgraded suspension   it takes in bumps smoothly and even corners quite well for a midsized car   the seats are comfortable and well supportive   and the controls   though some looking quite tacky   are in easy reach and easy to use   the gauges are goodsized and understandable   and the overall roominess is great    weaknesses    it is equipped with the   l vulcan engine   and there s not too much good i can say about that   first   the car is very underpowered   it doens t even come close to matching the other competitors acceleration figures   also   under hard acceleration   the engine has noticeable vibration and is quite loud for a supposedly   quot refined quot   v    also   the axle ratio on this car is extremely low   at around      this means it revs really high and not that high of a speed   also   in overdrive   it hits about    rpm while cruising at mph   our van only does about    at this speed   also mechanically   i m not to impressed with the transmission on this car   when you accelerate real lazy   it shifts smooth out of first   when you give it about half throttle   it shifts pretty rough   but then   when you floor it   it shifts smooth again   figure that one out   also   when it shifts from second to third at no matter what speed   it almost sounds like the engine hesitates before continuting on   lastly   the design of this model year taurus is pretty bad   it s way too   quot bubble shaped quot   as my girlfriend says   the circular rear window somewhat hinders rear vision   and the bulge at the top of the doors make it kind of hard to use the side mirrors    overall    i personally wouldn t really recommend this car to anyone especially if you look at other cars out there in this price range hondas   toyotas   etc   this definately isn t the greatest car has ever built   it somewhat lacks in the quality department   kind of ironic considering their slogan   quot quality is job   quot     
638,0,  when purchasing a new or used vehicle   one always wants to be as knowledgeable as possible about the options available   however   sometimes no amount of research can prepare you for the treachery that lies ahead   when you make an error purchasing a vehicle   the taurus is a perfect example of this paradox   when researching this particular vehicle   you will find raving reviews from many reviewers   everyone from housewives to the consumer reports the problem is   or it appears that   generally when a person is attesting to   or commenting on the reliability of a car particularly a new car   it is generally before the problems have taken place the taurus is relatively pleasing to look at   with it s sporty   areo dynamic design   the interior is very comfortable and roomy   the ride is quiet and smooth   and it generally gets very reasonable fuel mileage   having all these things going for it however   does not alleviate the frustration of the fact that there have been so many recalls on many different areas of the vehicle   transmission   steering stabilizers   air conditioning   electrical system   etc   that it spends more time in the repair facility than it does in a driveway as well   i was incredibly disappointed and frustrated with the attitude and the lack of concern shown by the   when notified of the seemingly chronic problems that arose with the vehicle   although this vehicle has been rated very highly in the safety tests performed on vehicles in this class   and although it is a pleasing vehicle as far as aesthetics   a consumer would certainly want to take into account the potential lack of reliability   as well as the difficulty in getting the adequate and appropriate service performance from that would make this car acceptable to own     
639,0,  i originally bought this vehicle because it was well priced and i thought it met all of my needs   as soon as i got it there were problems   since then   i have been in every two months to have warranty service on the car done   it runs terribly   the car is two years old and it allready needed a new transmission   the car accelerates slowly and is uncomfortable   the engineering is terrible given that the seatbelts bunch up and everything seems to clatter around   as for the positives   the cruise control is easy to use   i would not recomment this car to anyone who plans to drive more then   mins a day without having to shoot themselves   i would also not recomment this for someone who does not have   hours a week to deal with the warranty service center   or for someone who likes to travel at over   miles per hour     
640,0,  after having my second child   i wanted a family car so i purchased the taurus   the car ran fine for the first   years   after that it has not been the same   the speedometer   odometer and power steering all went out   it was still under warranty so we took it back to the dealership and they fixed the speedometer   odometer and power steering but now   months later it is still not running right   it has trouble shifting from first to second gear and the dealership said they could find nothing wrong with it   that is just the way it runs   if that is the way all tauruses run   then they have a problem   i do like the roominess of the interior and the trunk   the backseat is large enough that with   children   they can not reach each other with is a plus   the trunk is large enough to fit luggage and a stroller in it   if i just lucked into a bad one in the bunch and they are not all like this then this would be a good car for people with children   if they all run like this   then i would not recommend it br br  
641,0,  my dad bought this car used   he paid     for it   it was used   and had just over    miles on it   so the price was right   he needed a low mileage vehiclee because he s a salesman and piles on the miles incredibly in this thing   after about   months of use   he s already put over    miles on it   it s been okay so far   but i m hoping he ll replace it really soon and getting something much better like a buick regal or something   i almost have him convinced on that car the taurus is my dad s car   it is equipped with the   l vulcan engine   and there s not too much good i can say about that   first   the car is very underpowered   it doens t even come close to matching the other competitors acceleration figures   also   under hard acceleration   the engine has noticeable vibration and is quite loud for a supposedly   quot refined quot   v    also   the axle ratio on this car is extremely low   at around      this means it revs really high and not that high of a speed   also   in overdrive   it hits about    rpm while cruising at mph   our van only does about    at this speed   also mechanically   i m not to impressed with the transmission on this car   when you accelerate real lazy   it shifts smooth out of first   when you give it about half throttle   it shifts pretty rough   but then   when you floor it   it shifts smooth again   figure that one out   also   when it shifts from second to third at no matter what speed   it almost sounds like the engine hesitates before continuting on   lastly   the design of this model year taurus is pretty bad   it s way too   quot bubble shaped quot   as my girlfriend says   the circular rear window somewhat hinders rear vision   and the bulge at the top of the doors make it kind of hard to use the side mirrors   admittedly   the taurus has an excellent ride quality   with the upgraded suspension   it takes in bumps smoothly and even corners quite well for a midsized car   the seats are comfortable and well supportive   and the controls   though some looking quite tacky   are in easy reach and easy to use   the gauges are goodsized and understandable   and the overall roominess is great   previous to this car   my dad had a   taurus   compared to that   this new taurus is much above   however   a guy i know owns a   pontiac bonneville   and i would take that   to   over this car   that is one slick car   not only is it extremely quick   it is quite   and incredibly smooth   i personally wouldn t really recommend this car to anyone except older folks who don t drive too much   this definately isn t the greatest car has ever built   it somewhat lacks in the quality department   kind of ironic considering their slogan   quot quality is job   quot   it s an okay car   but it s not on the top of my list     
642,0,  i bought this car in the summer of    at that point the car was just over   years old and had    miles on it   it was a one owner local trade in   and an internet title search revealed no major accidents   floods   or other problems   i paid us     as of this writing    years later   the car has    miles on it   i am religious about scheduled maintenance   so the car has been well taken care of   i put a lot of miles on it in the first   months i had it   but have since relocated and now only drive it about k a year so far i have not had to fix anything really major   but i have been perturbed by a number of small annoyances   first   days after i purchased the car   there was a problem with a sensor governing the cooling system   it made the cooling fan run all the time   so that the car ran too cold on the highway   the dealer fixed this for free under the terms of a   month    mile warrantee that came with the car second   the   cd changer never worked right   it won t play a cd in the    slot   i complained about this to the dealer when i brought the car back for the problem mentioned above   and he replaced the cd changer unit   but it didn t fix the problem   either i got two bad units with the same problem   or the problem lay somewhere else   since i sometimes have more pressing matters than dealing with this stuff   i never went back to the dealer again about the cd unit and live with a   cd changer instead third   like several others in this forum   my taurus has problems with the door is ajar sensor   it s completely unpredictable   sometimes it thinks for days that a door is ajar   then suddenly the light goes off and all is well again for a while   i haven t had time to get this fixed yet   so in the meantime i yanked the circuit breaker for the interior lights    check your owner s manual   it s clearly marked and easy to do fourth   another strange electrical problem has seemed to go away   inexplicably   on its own   for a while   all of the lighted information on the center console   radio   clock   a c info   etc   would disappear at random intervals   when this happened   i had to turn on the headlights   which turned on the dashboard lights   to work the radio or a c   very annoying   even weirder   the problem hasn t recurred in nearly a year the fifth annoyance is that the entire center console between the two front seats seems to have one main function   creaking and squeaking   it drives me nuts   it squeaks and creaks constantly   i ll mention this to the dealer when i take it in for the door ajar problem   but i m not optimistic about them fixing it so it doesn t creak and squeak sixth   with k on the car i m noticing the beginnings of a leaky valve cover gasket   which will need to be replaced   this used to be a job for the do it yourselfer   i did one once on an old mercury comet v    and i m not all that handy really   but these days the way engines are crammed into tiny engine compartments i woudn t want to try it myself on the taurus   a leaky valve cover gasket can happen eventually to any car but shouldn t happen at k in my opinion and seventh   at k miles i had to replace both front brake rotors and both rear brake drums because they were all warped   there was subtle brake pedal vibration at k miles and by k it wasn t subtle any more   that shouldn t happen   even before i bought the car   i d heard that the rotors warp easily on these cars   and that has certainly been my experience so   to sum up   i haven t exactly been thrilled with the taurus   if i m experiencing these problems in the first k   what is it going to be like at k true   i can afford a lot of small repairs with the    or so i saved by not buying a new camry or accord   thus   for me   the big question is whether the powertrain will hold up over the long haul   if so   the car will still have been a bargain despite its annoyances   if not   i would have been better off buying a new camry or accord  
643,0,  back in december    i purchased a   thunderbird lx v with    miles on it   when i was handed the keys after signing all the paperwork and had put a deposit on   days prior when i first test drovie it   the car now had    miles on it   one of the salesman decided he was going to use this car to commute back and forth to work   this was the start of my problems i specifically had a car alarm installed by the dealer as my prior vehicle   a convertible suzuki sidekick   which was an absolutely wonderful vehicle   was a target for theives   well   they didn t install a second switch to cut off the alarm should the remotes die or the alarm short circuits   i discovered this   months later and they said there was nothing they could do about it unless i paid   oh well   i just hoped nothing would happen   first thing i did when driving out of the dealership was get new snow tires    it snowed that night well   during the course of owning this vehicle   for   and half years   i put about    miles on it   not too bad   i went through   sets of complete breaks   all the u joints and cv joints were replaced twice   the radiator and fan   not the fan belt but the fan   was replaced three times   when i got the car   i noticed the antenna was bent and the windshield wiper was shot   brought it to a closer lincoln dealer to have these items fixed under warranty to discover the dealership i purchased it from signed me up under their own extended warranty    not the warranty which i specified   different times   we had to go back over there and pay   dollars more   then they fixed the two problems lets see   the transmission was rebuilt twice   the driver side window would stick on occasion and not shut completely   the radio was awful   and the kicker    the service people don t know what the problem is   ooooohhhh i get so steamed when i think of this    i find out toward the end of my warranty after dealing with countless service people being rude to me   telling me it was a figment of my imagination that the car is stalling and three dealerships to figure out that there was no oil in the engine even though the dipstick said there was oil   they told me that happens when an engine gets old    and refused to fix it under warranty during the time i owned this vehicle    i contacted corporate repeatedly and they never responded   finally   months before the warranty ended    someone called me back    all sarcasm aside   they finally tell me there is a dispute settlement board    oh   i was supposed to get a free loaner anytime my car was in the shop for warranty repairs   never got it    now i wanted my money back   the dispute settlement board refused and conveniently stated this is between me and the individual dealerships   they also said it was past my warranty    i sent it in two weeks before it expired   you get the idea i will never buy or claim ownership another product again   they left such a taste of vile in my mouth   i have a jeep now and its wonderful     may you rot in a garbage can    your service and vehicles are way below acceptable standards  
644,0,  my husband fell in love with this car when he saw it on the dealership s lot   we needed another vehicle   as i had totaled our taurus the previous month   this vehicle has a v    which both my husband and i enjoy   it also has all the little luxuries   the premium sound system   cd player   sun roof   keyless entry   leather seats   power seats   windows and locks   and automatic climate control   these little luxuries really make for a nicer driving experience   it truly was great until we had our daughter this car only has two doors   and putting her in and taking her out of the carseat can be difficult at times   if you re riding in the back seat behind someone who needs more leg room in the front you can get cramped if you re tall as well   it might be ok for short rides   but for longer trips it would be uncomfortable   the trunk space is also limited   this is fine if there s just one or two of you on a short road trip   if you re trying to go for longer distances with more luggage   forget it   i went to the airport one time to pick up my sister in law   and she brought two large suitcases   one would fit in the trunk   the other had to go in the back seat   thankfully   at that point   we didn t have our daughter   and we could put the suitcase there   this was a great car for us before we had children   and will make a great car for my husband when we buy a more family friendly vehicle if you re single or a young couple without children   this would be great for you   if not   spend your money on a four door sedan or a mini van br br  
645,0,  i have leased a   thunderbird now for almost   years   i have had it since it was new   i leased the car based on it s nameplate and v   power   the car has good styling and roominess   the power from the   l engine is impressive and a pleasure when on the highway   i wouldn t opt for the   l v   for a car this size   all the controls are well laid out to give you a sports car feel   but not the sports car s lack of space   the seats could use more support though   long rides might be tiresome for those that prefer stiffer seats   the six way power driver s seat is nice to get you in just the right position   and the tilt wheel will help finish getting you into that right position   the premium sound stereo is not bad for a factory unit and will make most people happy   the semi automatic climate control isn t the greatest   there aren t many positions to bring just fresh air in   most times you are either using the heater or the air conditioning   these extremes will do the job though   i do prefer the older r   refrigerant though   it does a much better job at cooling the interior than the newer r a   the two major downfalls on this car are it s handling and brakes   the brakes are typical   not enough for the vehicle   you will be able to stop but you ll wish you had more brakes than you do   the abs works well   the electronic traction assist although doesn t   on anything less than clean   dry roads you will have to pay attention to what the car is doing   this is easy to tell though by the feel you get in the seat   much of this might have to do with the independent rear suspension   i don t believe put enough effort into putting the right springs in the rear of the car   it always sits high in the back which might be taking away from downforce on the rear for better traction   this could be fixed   if you are an avid automotive lover   by aftermarket springs   these would level the look of the car and lower it just a little   all this would enhance the independent suspension   many finer cars from bmw   mercedes benz   the corvette all use this type of suspension to give their cars a better ride   if had done a little more work the thunderbird would have been a much better car   this car is not for novice drivers or drivers who can t keep an eye on what their car is doing   for those drivers who like a challenging car or a car that would test their driving skills this is the car for you   i am still undecided on whether or not i will purchase this car at the end of it s lease   the power is comparable to a gt or sport package crown victoria   it s size is more roomier than a and with a few upgraded parts would probably run better than the   the pride in owning a thunderbird is in it s nameplate   a nameplate with history   more history than the camaro   firebird trans am and   it originally was the leading sports car from the u s   until started making a more potent corvette     
646,0,   author s note    this is not a review of the zx   it s a review of the   door se   for which there is no category even though there are   categories for the zx   be forewarned there s not a single thing wrong with driving a small car    in fact   it s generally my opinion that there   is   something wrong with driving big cars   this is especially true for condo dwelling attorneys and accountants who insist on driving diesel powered duallys and suvs the size of school buses   on the rare occasions that ms scmrak lets me have it   i drive a toyota tacoma   otherwise it s a honda accord   so when the rental agency couldn t give me a   standard   car for my two week rental   i went ahead and took the escort they   did   have   reluctantly   though   and not because it s fire engine red   reluctantly because i ve driven these things before now at the end of my two week rental   with   plus miles of driving the car   i m ready to take the little red sewing machine back to the rental people with my compliments   why   it s not that it s small   although it   is   rather cozy if there s anyone else in the car   it s that nobody should ever have designed a car with an engine this small married to an   automatic transmission   there s nothing particularly   wrong   with that little four banger   it gets around   mpg on the highway   come to think of it though   i ve driven   cylinder cars that get upwards of    likewise   there s nothing particularly wrong with the escort design    it s neither attractive nor unattractive   just sort of a blah little car   in fact it makes a pretty good car for running errands around town   it scoots into parking places neatly   turns on a dime   and has a fairly roomy trunk for your purchases as a highway car   though   it s a dog   even worse than its grandparent   the pinto   the marriage of a low torque   underpowered four cylinder engine to an automatic transmission geared for economy has created a puppy that can t outrun its own shadow   sure   it s got lots of low end power for pickup away from a stop light   but try to accelerate from   to   on a highway   and you ll have plenty of time to pick out a new china pattern and get your teeth cleaned while you wait   i could only hope that a five speed manual transmission would be an improvement over the three speed automatic b the accelerator pedal   for better or for worse   the escort s built on s oval concept   like the redesigned taurus and the contour   that oval motif abounds   including dashboard   instrument panel   mirrors   and trim elements   the design makes for a clean shape and clear sight lines from the cockpit   the cabin is relatively comfortable   although cramped   and the trunk affords plenty of storage room   the engine runs smoothly and efficiently   with good mileage   in the    range for my two weeks and   miles of mixed highway and city driving   the vehicle handles nimbly at low speeds   the steering is responsive   overall   the construction is on par with or exceeds similar american made cars   and approaches the quality of japanese economy imports   in point of fact   the escort is an excellent example of the timeworn maxim    you get what you pay for   doesn t squander much of its budget on amenities   which is a good idea for an economy car   unfortunately   they don t squander much on engine power   either b the brake pedal   s fascination with that oval design motif extends too far in at least one case   the side view mirrors afford a dangerously small field of vision   particularly at the outer edges   the interior has plenty of headroom   but the door openings are short    sometimes painfully so   as passengers are prone to bumping heads while entering and exiting   the standard four cylinder engine is underpowered at high speeds   and noisy at any speed   at idle   it sounds suspiciously like a sewing machine   at full throttle   the noise can drown out the radio   my sample   which now has slightly below    miles under its fanbelt   has developed a few rattles and squeaks plus a tendency to buzz at certain engine speeds   the air conditioning unit struggled to cool the car in direct sunlight   even though houston topped out at   degrees f while i was driving the escort    where the rubber meets the road   overall the car is    as mentioned above    a good example of getting what you pay for   if you have enough cash for a tricked out escort   though   i d strongly suggest getting yourself a similarly priced version of an import    it will hold its value longer and very likely be less prone to problems involving design and workmanship   if you can drive a manual transmission   it would be a better option for this vehicle   the combination of a puny power plant with an automatic transmission is unsettling at highway speeds  
647,0,  i bought a   white probe in    it had    miles on it   and according to my mechanic   was in good shape   it had a manual transmission   a sunroof   power windows   power door locks   and tinted windows   it drove very well   and it was my favorite car   but that did not last very long i had to take it to the shop to get a new transmission after having it only four months   i also had several other problems which i will not go into at this time   the culmination of the problems was when the engine burned up in    i was driving down the highway when all of the sudden   smoke starts coming out of the hood   i pull over   look at the hood   and almost open it   before i noticed flames shooting out from under the hood   luckily   i had a cellular phone with me and called   to get them to extinguish my car   the engine was totally melted which basically the car was totaled   i did not take any action against   but if i knew what i know now   i would have   i have heard from at least two other people who had owned probes that the same thing happened to them the bottom line is steer clear of this car if you can     
648,0,  i bought a   probe gl in    i payed    for it used   the car was a very good deal at the time   i am a certified mechanic so i check out the car throughly   finding nothing really wrong with the car i purchased it about   months after i bought it the rack and pinion went out    week after that the radiator went out with the lower control arm   the headlight motors the exhaust system the automatic seatbelts   the passenger side mirror   the power steering pump   the rocker arms and oh yeah finally the fuel pump wires arched against the gas tank when i ws driving and the back of the car went up in flames   i got out in time before it was too late   so my opion is do not buy a old probe it is nothing but headache br br  
649,0,  i haven t driven an escort since my   model and now i know why   our xlt was involved in an auto accident a few weeks ago so our rental car is this   escort   now i ve owned a escort before   it was a   model and after two blown headgaskets   a new radiator   major engine work and    later   i traded it in for my first truck which was a toyota x until i traded that in for the   now that you know why i am driving this escort   let me tell you about it b dwarf ponies or maybe mice b this little car may be economical   but it certainly is comical when it comes to the   horsepower   this thing has   to put it bluntly   it sucks on hills   you need to start hitting the gas pedal hard about   feet before you climb a hill or else it simply will max out and everyone is passing you b park place   we ve been driving this car now for two weeks   we have had to leave at least   to   minutes early so we can get this car out of park   the button that releases the stick is a crap shoot if you get it to push in so it will release the shift   i spent   minutes of my lunch hour yesterday trying to get it out of park   i swore that when i did i was going right to the rental place to exchange cars   they did not have any available   but the guy told me that if the shift would not move out of park to push this little flat black button next to the stick and it would release the shift and allow me to push the shift s button all the way in so i can move out of park   now he tells me b but there is a bright side   the car gets excellent gas mileage   in these days of high gas prices   it cost us     to fill the tank up and it lasted for a good   miles of mostly highway driving   our guzzles about double that   but it is a   gallon tank   but gets only about   miles more than the escort b price   as a rental   you can t beat the price     a day   as a first family car   i would also recommend it   in fact i recommend everyone should rent the vehicle they intend on buying for a week to see if it will meet all of their expectations   a simple test drive won t tell you how it performs in your daily lives and it is far better to spend that extra    to make sure it will  
650,0,  ok   we aren t rich   and can t afford a new car   but   i have had the experience of this thing   if i did have the money for a new car this would be one of the last cars i would pick   if i won a free one in a contest   i would sale it   ok   we had a   escort    door   this is a     door   ra was rear ended   this is the rental car they gave us to use   ok   what i really don t like is the electronic windows   which is a danger to me in a vehicle accident   being in the ambulance for   plus years   electric windows and things of that make it a lot harder to access a vehicle once a battery is cut    have to take out a window if the doors are locked   the only thing that is not is the seat belts   go figure   our older escort   had automatic seat belts and that s the only thing   i just find that funny ok   the dash   center consul the radio controls and heat controls   all sort of blend in together   the dash lights come on automatically when the car is running   when night time comes and you turn on the head lights   the stupid dash lights dim   yeah there is a knob to brighten them   but not as much as we would like   it s not exactly easy on gas   as i was figured it would be   it uses more than our   year older car   pretty much the same   we travel a lot   it s a hour to ra s family   so at least once a week we travel there   i didn t like the way this car rides   after half the trip toward his family   i decided i hate the way it rides   never before    aside from when i was pregnant   have i gotten car sick on this trip   nor did my kids   we all ended up car sick half way there   and had to make a emergency stop   something else   the baby would sleep most of the trip in our car   he carry s on at least half the trip in the    and i think its the way he rides in this thing too    or maybe he can sense how uncomfortable we all are   i like driving the car   but ra doesn t   the sun visors are too small   the headlights   which can be moved a bit   are two low and outward   the worst thing so far   we were heading home   first really warm day   and we had the windows down   it started to rain   we smoke   i know shame shame   so up went the windows   well when we cracked the widows to smoke   the design of this car   the water poured in the windows   they weren t even open a half of a inch   i have rode in many cars and had windows cracked open over the years   at least   off of the top of my head   and this is the only time that s happened granted i will give you the safety features   have to have break depressed to put in or out of gear   locks on master window controls so that only the driver can control all the windows   but that stinks because when it s on   i can t open and close my window the dome light stays on till you start the car or for a time after you get out    talk about frustration   till we learned all these things out also maybe you will find this funny as i didn t   and do now   the first time i drove this car after dark   after unloading kids   handing them bags sending them toward the house   i loaded up the last of everything into my arms and kicked the door shut almost losing half my load   the dome light didn t go out   so i butt bumped all the doors to make sure they were closed   swearing at the light still being on   i despirately with much difficaulty sat the soda s from mc d s on the hood   put the bags from my hand on the hood   slide the bag from my wrist down on my hand and sat it up on the hood dug the keys out of my pocket and got six inches from the lock and the light went off   again swearing and kicked the car   got the stuff loaded back up and headed toward the house as ra came looking for me   then laughed hysterically at me   only because he had done the same thing   making it back to the house and noticeing the light on till he got his boots on and back out side it was off   ok   there is a button for trunk in the glove box   even if car is shut off    i don t like that part   but do in a way   like the child that died from locking himself in and with the keys   till they found him   they couldn t get him help   worth breaking a window to me that way to pop the truck with no keys but it makes it easier to get into for would be thiefs   electronic door locks   with the extra by window button locks too    i like that a lot   lots of trunk space   the only advantage this has over our older model   is three seat belts instead of two and four doors instead of two i just feel   i found more cons   with having this thing here for two weeks   with the many many other brands and types of cars out there   there is a lot of better choices to pick   sure i gave you   a lot of things i don t like about this car   but i feel the pros are few   and this car would make a poor choice for anyone   maybe that s because i don t have the money for a new car   looking at spending that much on a car   i would expect it to be lacking any poor quality in any way it s made    i hope you understand what i mean br br  
651,0,  my first new car purchase was a zx   i wanted a car that was economical on gas   i really liked the way it looked too   but sometimes looks can be deceiving   it s a snappy little car and it does get good gas mileage   but don t try to smoke a cigarette when it s raining out   the water drips right into the window   it s really a hassle   it s not from the rain coming from the sky either   it s the rain wiped from the windshield that gets you   mostly it drips right onto the controls for the locks and windows   the tires on this car are   quot   this would not be a problem if you were not worried about the cost to replace them   they only last for about    to    miles   the cheapest tires i found were     and   supposedly   only goodyear makes them   that is not very economical in my book   the cassette player died after   year   the passenger side window failed to close after   months   the ride is ok   the struts seem a little stiff even after a year of driving it   i think could have done a much better job of creating this vehicle   do your homework when buying any vehicle   don t get stuck with an economical vehicle that costs too much to maintain br br  
652,0,  i recently rented a late model escort for a month   i m not one of those people whose identities are shaped and or expressed by a cool car     the more anonymous   the better   is my motto   few cars are more generic than a beige escort   i kept mistaking other cars for my rental   once even accidentally setting off the alarm on a similar looking sedan   i cravenly ran away before the owner could show up under   miles per hour and   feet of driver height   this is generally a decent utilitarian car   it handles decently   especially in confined spaces like parking lots   is extremely easy to park   and goes in and out of first gear fairly snappily if somewhat twitchily   there s a surprising amount of interior space for such a small car   plenty for me    although i never use the back seats   so i can only speak for the front seats   the trunk is also quite roomy for a subcompact    i managed to shove a huge computer box in there   which wouldn t fit into the trunk of a midsize sedan   this would be a very nice car for running around town   especially if you re a woman however   most of my driving is done on highway   in california   this is where the two biggest weaknesses of the escort are revealed   it sucks on the freeway   and the gas tank is really really small   this car has no pickup at highway speeds    now that the speed limit in many states has been increased   this is a bigger concern than it might have been a couple years ago   the brakes are also correspondingly weak and squeaky   and cornering at highway speeds is not very secure feeling   the ride is also extremely rattle y   like small parts might be about to break off at any moment   finally   with my   mile daily commute it seems like i rattle my way from one gas station to the next   i haven t been blown away by the mileage i m achieving either   which seems to be less than   miles per gallon finally   this car is clearly designed for shorter drivers   i m    quot   the steering wheel is small   the car rides low   the dash is low   the ignition key is set super low   and the seat can be pushed forward so far your thighs can be trapped under the console   if you re a larger human being   you won t appreciate any of this br br  
653,0,  as a social worker i find myself on the georgia highways and byways usually doing a lot of commuting especially when it comes to traveling with a group of children   if you ve ever taken a trip with a bunch of teenagers then you know the importance of traveling in the right vehicle   which brings me to my most recent outing to the movies with my group of weekend pre teens in the   windstar lx   frankly   as a bachelor the minivan would not be my first choice as a slime and trim sporty auto   primarily due to its style since minivans usually have   family   written all over them   however for those looking for a family van you may find one of the six models of the   windstar to your liking   the models or trims which is a term used in the automotive world to describe the different styles available which includes your base model   the lx   se   sel   the limited or the se sport   the vehicle we used was the windstar   lx passenger van   the windstar van made me feel like i was turning into my father   i immediately began having flashbacks of our station wagon and all the family discussion regarding that vehicle   the other families in our neighborhood referred to us as the   brady bunch    the brady bunch was   abc tv series in which the brady family used a   plymouth station wagon the windstar is synonymous with practical family transportation and although i don t consider it stylish   and find it to plain for my taste   for some this versatile vehicle is becoming as popular as the   plymouth station wagon   this passenger van has a savage v    valve   speed electronic automatic transmission engine with an electronic ignition   it s almost identical to its   windstar predecessor with its    liter   cylinder engine   when driving this vehicle you can really feel front wheel drive the pulling to the front wheels   on the highway this machine floats like a   cadillac   if you ve ever road in a   cadillac you will remember how it almost floats like a boat on the highway   the van is a little bouncy on the road probably due to the soft suspension that seems to sway when driving   the front suspension uses the highly recommended macpherson struts   while at the rear a twist beam axle acts as its own stabilizer bar with its suspension coil springs   the windstar s steel body is very rigid   despite it s rack and pinion steering system it s considered a heavyweight in the minivan world   there is nothing fancy about the outside since exterior features are fairly rudimentary red color   its red from the front and rear colored bumpers to the red colored grille   the windstar s seven passenger seating offers lots of room and comfortable seating for smaller framed people however if you are traveling with a teenagers wearing baggy clothes it seats five comfortably   there are three rows of seats   the front bucket seats with the fixed headrest and armrest remind are fairly comfortable for the driver   however you can only adjust these two seats so far   perhaps in a   i was expecting a softer seat   or perhaps captain chairs like the seat on the star trek enterprise   the seats were fairly comfortable during our trip to the movies however i would suspect that they would not be as equally comfortable on long distance trip   it s nice that the passenger seat is adjustable and removable with full folding   person bench second row seating   legroom is plentiful if you are     any taller and you may feel a bit cramped   the windstar lx features the much talked about   wheel anti locking braking system and dual airbags   with adjustable seatbelts plus daytime running halogen headlamp lights   although the daytime running lights are popular   i personally don t like them   perhaps its related to my childhood memories of attending funerals with my dad driving   following a processional of cars streaming their lights during the day   standard equipment on all of the   windstar lx include tinted glass   an am fm stereo system with four speakers two in the front and two in the rear   it also features a passive anti theft system   cupholders and a locking glove box with a light installed   the windstar is a functional piece of machinery   in a   vehicle i was looking for more up to date features and gadgets   the simple dashboard with the typical layout is boring   is notorious for its poor ergonomics and dashboard layout   on the dashboard you will find the typical analog instrumentation with a tachometer   trip odometer   water temp gauge   and the usual warning indicators including the oil pressure   battery   lights on   key in ignition   low fuel   low washer fluid   door ajar   brake fluid   the only that s new to me is the bulb failure light in all fairness the lx does have a sliding door on the driver s side which seemed unusual at first and took a little getting use to   this van is ideal for people that want to use their minivan for a small business because it allows you the ability to toss out the rear bench seat   the windstar is an affordable minivan ranging between     to    depending upon the model you choose   although there are no recalls on the windstar   lx   this particular has a history of recalls and mechanical problems   in   there was a recall on the rear power windows because the connections failed and the wiper switch needed to be replaced   so far it has not been reported that the windstar   faces the challenges of its predecessor s   it s been noted by that the windstar is the first minivan to earn the u   s   government s five star front crash test rating   the safety system   includes dual stage front air bags   crash severity sensors   safety belt usage sensor   driver seat position sensor   and safety belt pretensions plus the lift gate comes with a high mounted lamp which provides excellent light at night   we road on   good p r bsw tires w    inch   spoke wheel coverings   however if you get a flat you ll be riding around on a donut since this vehicle comes with a mini spare tire   the windstar   lx uses unleaded gas   yet guzzles it like a   cadillac   in a time when gas prices are sky rocketing this    liter engine is not the most economical   albeit my experience with the windstar lx was limited   and in spite of this vans impressive safety rating   this vehicle would not be my first choice for family travel   it would be ideal if would match safety and customer satisfaction   i was looking for a little bit more out of a   
654,0,  leased a   windstar lx   maintenance package   daytime running lights   safety package   etc   we really want to like this vehicle but the number of irritations makes it impossible   soem are the quality of the vehicle some are dealer together they generate a very bad ownership experience first it is a gas guzzler    mpg dealer   of upland   ca   says so what   the electronics are sloppy   the auto mirrors   seats   and day running lights don t work   the memory adjustments for the seats and mirrors reset to neutral every time you hit the unlock button   dealer says    just reprogram   why have memory if you have to adjust them each time you get in   the day running lights generate an error on the dash that must be canceled to view mileage etc   every time you start the van   air conditioner makes a loud clunk when you first turn it on   poor controls on the onboard video system   seats are very heavy and hard to get in and out   purchased the regular maintenance package on the basis of oil change is same as quick lube service our first oil change we had to leave the van for   hours   has very poor quality control over dealers our th van with each has gotten worse    our last  
655,0,  i admit that i m not much of a mechanic so this will not be detailed or technical   i ll just get to the basics   six years ago   my parents bought a   windstar   and today   it s a constant pain   we ve had problems with all sorts of noises   there have been times when we had noises whenever the car turned and noises when you apply the brakes   also   the brake warning light is constantly coming on leading to road trips in which we worry if we ll make it home safely   we usually don t use it for long trips unless we have a lot of stuff to carry   we ve also had transmission problems   the brakes have even stopped working once   however   when we take the van to the place to get it fixed   the mechanics claim that they don t hear the noises   when they do   fix   it   we end up with a different noise the next month   once   we even had to take it back the week after taking it to the shop   further taking the car to the shop is a day long event   or longer   and a major incovenience it turns out that the windstar was recalled because of brake problems but not the   although it appears that there was reason to   apparently we were among the truly blessed since others have had accidents caused by head gasket problems   the epinions site wouldn t let me put the link here for you   it read it as a word that was too long   but look it up at consumeraffairs all in all it seems sorry compared to our toyota camry which we rarely have to take to the shop and when we do   the service is much better   over the years we have spent thousands on fixing this car   my mom s credit card bill has risen because of repairs on this minivan   perhaps you would be blessed to find one of the good ones but i wouldn t risk it  
656,0,  after a disastrous encounter with a drunk driver in    my husband bought this car   new   with the insurance money   although we thought it was cool when we first got it   we soon outgrew it   unfortunately   we could not afford to replace it until last year   when we got a new   nissan maxima se b first   what did i like about this car b it looked cool   with front and rear spoilers and ground effects   it had a low   throaty growl that just sounded tough   when i was    i thought this was    quot kewl quot i    now that i m somewhere around    it s just noise pollution   this is a car that announces its presence    guys   if you re considering buying this car and you still have a curfew   this car will make it impossible for you to sneak home after hours i i also liked the power of this car   at hp   the slightest touch on the gas would send the car hurtling forward   i could pretend i was on the   batman amp robin   ride at six flags   somewhere around   or    i set my personal best land speed record on an unnamed interstate   at   mph    the car could go faster   but we were gaining too quickly on some state troopers ahead when i started dating my husband   he d just gotten this car   i did agree to marry him   so i guess you could say that girls dig this car b what didn t i like about this car b where do i begin   first let me say that this car was maintained very carefully   even babied   and garaged as often as possible   even so    the gt we had was an automatic transmission   which made this car a lot less fun to drive   combined with a rear wheel drive and a lot of power   it was   almost impossible to control in bad weather    even on plowed streets   the   stang had trouble getting up moderate hills   compared to my cars    toyota celica gt    probe gt   there was a significant decrease in the amount of control   even in the rain   i ve done donuts across   lane highways going   miles per hour in the   it s not an experience i d care to repeat     overall poor design b   there are horrendous blind spots out of both side rear windows   making it difficult to pass other cars on the highway   given that the sheer power of this car makes you want to go fast on the highway   it becomes very frustrating very quickly    same with the hood   the slope of it makes it hard to ascertain exactly where the front end of the car is   making parallel parking difficult the car has the worst turning radius of any car i ve ever driven   there is no such thing as a   point turn in this car   try   or   points to get this car turned around the horn is contained in two little buttons on the steering wheel   with the air bag taking up the center space   in an emergency situation   the last thing you want to do is to be looking frantically for the horn   honking the horn on this car takes finger precision   you can t just slam on the steering wheel   all you ll get is a little   quot slap   slap quot   as you re looking for the horn the instrument panel and stereo are made up of lots of little buttons   impossible to use if you re wearing gloves   the only exception is the heat ac   which are dials that are easily manipulated   same with the levers for moving the seats forward and back   small   difficult to find for a hatchback   it does not have much room in the back   the shape of the hatchback leaves the last foot of space virtually unusable   as it is only about   quot   high   the hatchback is also very heavy   opening and closing it is a full upper body workout needless to say   given that the roof of the car slopes down sharply after the front seats   the rear seats are uncomfortable for anyone over    quot   the front seats do not slide forward   and the front seat belts are attached to the rear armrests   so the front shoulder belt   quot clotheslines quot   passengers getting out of the back   ever wonder what it feels like to be born   trying to get out of the rear seats of this car is a pretty good approximation   because of the attachment of the seatbelts   which seem designed for people taller than    quot   the shoulder belt is not really adjustable   if you are    quot    like me   or shorter   you ll get a red welt on the side of your neck from the rubbing shoulder belt     things just break   over and over again b   this car does not have great reliability   it was fine for the first one or two years   and then it slowly began to fall apart   we noticed a constant squeaking noise within the first year   after several visits to the shop   they finally determined that it was the speedometer cable   after lubricating the cable   the squeaking stopped   for about two weeks   eventually we just learned to live with it from the rd to th years of owning it   the fuel pump died   three times i   each time was a     repair   not to mention car rental   there was never any notice that something was going wrong   it would just fail to start   completely dead   no turnover somewhere around this time   the a c finally died   too   i don t even remember what exactly the problem was   i think it was a freon leak somewhere in the system   either way   it was     that we didn t have at the time the hatchback pistons stopped holding the hatchback in the   quot raised quot   position after    years   and the repair lasted another   years   getting groceries out of the back   all   bags of them   involves lifting the hatchback in a clean and jerk motion   balancing it on your head   leaning   way   way   forward   remember the   quot   of unusable space at the rear of the hatchback   grabbing the groceries   and then ducking your head out fom under the hatchback   without getting clonked on the head or getting the greasy hatchback latch tangled in your hair    now repeat    times after about   years   the power windows and locks started to go   they d only work some of the time   sometimes the window would go down crooked   and it made another loud    quot squeeeeeeee quot b   noise as it was going up and down   eventually   the entire console on the passenger side just died   i could not lock or unlock the door   or raise or lower the windows   for a while   my husband could control them from his side   then they died altogether   and i had to climb in from the driver s side   or sit in the back   not easy to do in formalwear the computer also did strange things from around the th year on   for a few months   the battery would drain overnight and we couldn t charge it up again   after we brought it into the shop and they   quot reset the computer quot   it didn t happen any more   the   quot check engine quot   light would come on occasionally   especially in cooler weather   below   degrees   about    of the time   there really was something wrong   and the other    of the time   there was nothing wrong   sort of like your own version of lotto   except each ticket costs    and you never win     it s expensive b   in addition to the aforementioned repairs   the   quot sporty quot   nature of the car means that equipment is expensive   too   the car came with goodyear eagle gt tires   with the original tires   on a dry road   the car was a lot of fun to drive   but the wheel size is odd   and pretty much the only tires that would fit were performance goodyear eagles and yokohama tires that didn t last all that long         miles   in the ten years of owning this car   we never found tires to fit that were under    apiece insurance   too   was very very expensive   even with usaa   which is often    or    the cost of private insurance   my husband was paying around    per year   with a perfect driving record and in a state with low insurance rates    to compare   i had a similar value taurus insured through state farm and it was about    a year   his insurance went down a little when we got married   but not by much at best   the gt    gets around   mpg   of course   it likes hi octane gas   we noticed a significant difference in the pickup and in the noise between   octane and   octane   even before gas prices went nuts   we d pay almost    to fill the tank     comfort   what comfort b   thanks to the sporty suspension   the rock hard seats and the constant rumbling of the engine   you get a good feel of the road   every pebble and bump   after about   minutes   my butt would get numb from the vibration   i don t know if this is a good thing or not   on the one hand   you no longer feel every little crack in the road   on the other   you don t feel your own crack   either   and you climb out of the car waddling like the brady bunch after they took the mule ride into the grand canyon   in true muscle car tradition   there is also no insulation from the road noise and the engine noise   this was a typical conversation while driving in the i dr   kboo    how do i get to   rrrrrrr   by the   rrrrrrr   i kboo    turn right at   rrrrrrr   and then   rrrrrrr   i dr   kboo    what i kboo    turn   right   at   rrrrrrr   and then   rrrrrrr   at   rrrrrrr   gesturing frantically   here   here   now summary if you live in a warm   sunny climate and you don t need dependable transportation   the gt    is fun to drive   when it s working   it s barely comfortable for two people   and can t carry much stuff   whatever money you have left after filling it with gas will go to repairs   it is terrible for long road trips   as the seats are only comfortable for about    minutes on the other hand   even when we sold it last year     at   years old and around    miles   it still turned heads   there will always be a market for this car because of how it looks and sounds   and because of the name and tradition i would not recommend this car as a teen s first car   it is difficult to handle even for experienced drivers   and expensive to insure and maintain     
657,0,  through a bizarre series of family events   i attained my      lx hatchback for free   i had just got my license a week ago   so i was thrilled to receive such a legendary car as my first car   and completely for free   i mean   you re a   year old male   how could you say no to   horsepower    ft lbs of torque   a v engine with a few modifications here and there   the owner before me was quite the drag racing enthusiast   so the mods included   stabilizer bars   dual flowmaster exhaust   and ram air intake   the only thing i didn t like at the time was that it was automatic transmission   but no worries   it was free   and i saved my mother at least     ya know   maybe i had a lemon   i know how to take care of cars   i never raced it   and i treat my property with the utmost respect   but within the second week   there was a major transmission problem   it wouldn t go over   mph   i guess it wouldn t change into the next gear   all it did was rev high   my entire transmission had to be rebuilt   totaling about      my mother and i said to ourselves    okay   this is just one problem   we ll get it fixed   then that ll be it next thing i know   i m stuck in traffic on highway   and smoke is coming out from under my hood   i call up a friend who knows more about cars than i   and he suggests it s an old thermostat that should be replaced   so over a weekend   he and i replace the thermostat with relatively no trouble   besides a few bruised and cut fingers   after that   the car ran like a chime   for about a week   just today   in fact   i was stuck in traffic   my temperature gauge read normal   but there was smoke coming from underneath the car this time   it seems that there are too many problems for me to justify keeping the car   oil leak   improper alignment   squeaky brakes   wobbly power windows   the overheating   insurance   attention from cops   etc   most of the things i ve mentioned can be fixed   but the thing is that after i fix it   i know something else will turn up   i guess it just comes with the territory of a muscle car there are things i like about the car   its loud and growly exhaust never gets tiring   it s fast and powerful   with   ft lbs of torque   you can dust your everyday ricer and make them feel stupid for putting on those pointless decals   you get plenty of attention when cruising past the theater on a friday night   with ritualistic washing and detailing   the car looks beautiful   even if it has its share of dings and dents   but i m afraid that the problems i ve had outweigh the things i like about the car if you re into fun driving   i don t suggest this car   it ll give you good quarter mile times   but don t expect to do any canyon carving with this car   i mean   you could   but i know that i m too scared of going into uncontrollable oversteer and driving off of a cliff   heck   my airbag isn t even functional right now so i m looking into selling the   stang   it was a decent car while its problems remained hidden   besides   i m into   fun   driving   can you say mazda miata   toyota mr turbo   they may not beat a   stang or camaro on the strip   but personally   i see the bends more often than a quarter mile strip   and the thrill i get of downshifting and upshifting around a series of corners is much more exciting than getting low s at the strip  
658,0,  the may have lots of beef   but the one in my household just can t handle the power   my mother let me drive it to my prom last year and i was going to a party in which i had to travel about   exits on the interstate   when i arrived at my destination   there was enough smoke coming out from under the hood to attract the local fire department   when i came home   my mom thought that i broke it   she took it to the local garage   and they said that a piece of plastic had blown up in front of the radiator and blocked to air flow through it   this is a sign of poor engineering and i hope that since the   model   has fixed this flaw   it costed my mom over     to fix   then after a couple months   when my mom took the stang in for a rough shifting problem   they told her that a part had been recalled for her model of   this part happened to be the exact plastic piece that heated up and cracked when i drove it   another incident is just to note the quality of our local garage   my mom took her stang in to get a new battery and cables   a week later   her battery died again and she popped the hood   there was tons of corrosion caked al over the battery terminals   when she took it back to the garage   they admitted that a new battery had never been put in   then they tried to tell her that they would put a new battery in   but she would still have to pay for it   she told them to put in the battery and that she would expect not to pay for it   when she came to pick up the stang   her bill said    quot no charge quot   after this attempt to cheat my mom out of her hard earned cash   we have decided that the stang is the last we will own br br  
659,0,  do you know those days that seem perfect   just because of a little pleasant surprise    something like that happened to me in the early spring of     i was traveling to king of prussia   pa   and was just picking up my rental at the philly airport hertz   i was expecting the usual contour   but i got a instead   i felt like i was actually able to enjoy the ride this time let me tell you that the is normally not my kind of vehicle   i think i m a little too old   early thirties   for its target group   and i normally prefer japanese or german convertibles for my sport cars   but hey   what did i have to loose   the first thing i noticed when i got into the car was a strange smell   it smelled like a mixture of cleaner and bananas   i could explain the cleaner and then i found a ton of banana peels stuffed under the driver s seat   who had been driving this thing before    okay   but back to the vehicle itself   i liked the way it looked   it was a glossy black   and i like the older body style quite a bit i was surprised by its low rpm pickup   realizing that it was only the six cylinder model highway driving was great and very comfortable   with enough of reserves to pass when needed i had a ball pulling it out of the parking lot and getting it onto the freeway   the only thing that irked me was the somewhat jerky automatic transmission   yet it shifted predictably and at what seemed the right time for me the interior was typical for   cloth seats with lots of plastic around   but rather practical   i don t mind that kind of styling in my truck   but in a sporty vehicle    but i had to remind myself that this car is actually rather inexpensive so   rather pleased with the vehicle i arrived at my hotel   planning to take it out again for a spin the next day   to those who don t know the area   this part of pennsilvania is very hilly   with plenty of nice low traffic sideroads   taking the car through the hills and turns was something i had looked forward to boy   was i in for a surprise   i was owning a mazda miata at that time   and i approached the corners the same way i would have in the miata   the started to fishtail   and i had to put quite some effort into preventing the excessive oversteer from turning into a spin i thought it was a fluke   so i tried the next turn and the result was the same   i slowed down quite a bit after that   returning to the hotel i checked the car   tire inflation seemed to be fine and i couldn t detect any damage to the rims    at least as far as my visible inspection went   i didn t have a tire gauge with me i didn t take to cars   to the hills   after that and drove it around town it pains me to give a   do not recommend   to this vehicle   because i liked it quite a bit   it looks great and is very affordable   i m sure that one can have plenty of fun with it   but i would recommend it too a friend   because it is just too easy to be overconfident and use the power beyond what the car or the suspension can handle  
660,0,  a is a wonderful all around sports car   it has been around since    the early years i thin are still the best cars but some of the things on this new   were on the early models   such as the ring around the symbol of the   my friend has a   cobra with a mystic paint job   can you say wow   can this car win some awards   this car goes to almost   shows a year and has not gotten below nd place   this paint job is pretty smooth when the sun shines on the car it turns different colors such as green   blac   purple   blue it is relly neat looking br br  
661,0,  this car looks good    real good i had a handsome   red model on a long term hire from a dealership in san jose   when i was working there   and it certainly turned heads when i cruised down stevens creek boulevard on the way home from work    especially on the occasions when i was giving a lift home to lucy   a rather gorgeous blonde co worker of mine however   appearances aren t quite everything   and the   isn t quite as good as it looks   in performance terms at least put it this way you don t want to take it drag racing the acceleration is really quite poor   it is unresponsive to the throttle   and was embarrassingly beaten to the punch at the lights by several vehicles which could hardly be described as   sporty having said that   the mid range power is much more pleasing    there seems to be plenty of   oomph   under the bonnet when you put your foot down at   mph   however   another gripe i had was the sluggish handling   again a fairly minor consideration   but it did lack the   nippiness   that i have always associated with a good sports car however   these are only minor irritations   in conclusion   this is still one cool car   the performance isn t great   but when it looks this good   it s pretty easy to forgive still   i feel that if you are looking to buy a convertible   then better performance may be found elsewhere still fun to drive   though br br  
662,0,  while i was determining the fate of my    toyota camry   a couple of weeks ago   i had the experience of driving a    focus sedan   for a week as a rental car from   accent rental   the   focus   which i rented was advertised as a mid sized vehicle   believe me when i tell you   this vehicle is not mid sized in my personal opinion   the vehicle is small in size on the outside as well as the inside   as many of you may know from reading previous epinions   my oldest son is a big defensive lineman   somehow   i managed to get him inside this vehicle without him being overly uncomfortable   but overall the entire vehicle was way too small for my tastes   after we put the seat all the way back   there was no way that anyone could sit behind him   even a small child the interior of the   focus   which i drove was rather cheaply made   even though the vehicle only had about    miles on it the seats were showing signs of extreme wear both on the front and back   being that my own   quot new quot   car has about   more miles than the   focus   did   the quality of my   impala s   interior is far superior than the   focus   while the overall exterior of the   focus   was very attractive and the trunk space was rather roomy for a car this size   there were two things which i experienced with the performance of this vehicle which gave me a total negative impression of the   focus b the first thing that i really did not like about the   focus   is that the air conditioning needed to be a bit cooler in the car   i realize that the week that i had driven this vehicle was one of the hottest in atlanta s history   and the air quality was horrendous   but i felt that any vehicle that is   quot new quot   on the market should be able to completely fill the vehicle with cool air on demand   i found that i had to continuously run the air conditioning all of the time full blast to get this result because i had to run the air conditioning in that manner   i encountered the second problem which was more serious   with the air conditioning going full blast   the car had no get up and go   this presented problems when i was going up hills here in our area which are very steep to say the least   the   focus   had a hard time going up the hills and i had to give the vehicle so much gas that i thought i was going to flood the car   consequently when the week was up and i had purchased my new   impala    i was very happy to turn this vehicle in   i prefer to have a vehicle   quot move quot   when i give it the gas and do what i want it to do and the   focus   performed poorly in that aspect   if you live in an area where there are no hills   this vehicle may work out for you   in my personal opinion though   i believe the car has no get up and go in demanding situations and i do not recommend this vehicle for purchase features of the   focus   which i drove included    cylinder     liter    horsepower engine    automatic transmission   good mpg of   mpg in the city    mpg on the highway   am fm cassette radio stereo   power windows and locks   air conditioning   adjustable shoulder seatbelts br br  
663,0,  point by point i ll talk about the focus lx sedan i bought a because of my previous experience with the   escort hatchback   wonderful little vehicle   roomier than one might think   very fuel efficient with just enough power to get me onto the interstate   it has a manual transmission with the    liter engine   a very low maintenance car and with over    miles i still drive it   i bought the focus lx sedan   with the    liter sfi engine   because of this prior experience and because i was impressed with it s roominess and the layout if the dashboard   also   i felt that it had a relatively smooth automatic transmission   and   viewed from the proper angle it looks nice   took it for a test drive that should have been more rigorous and signed on the dotted line   well   as i said   i should have really tested it   particularly up hills and not necessarily steep hills   this car   with this engine and transmission   has next to no power   i was aware of its sluggishness when accelerating   even on level ground but i was not prepared for it s utter reluctance to go up a hill   i dare say that if i had more than two people total in it i would be in the embarrassing position of stopping the car at the base of the hill and asking my passengers to get out and push i firmly believe that this engine and automatic transmission in this car body is a total mismatch and that is a car that either does not know what it is doing or feels that it can purvey anything it wants on the car buying public and too bad   once you sign on the dotted line it s yours and you deal with it   after only    miles i m already looking into trading it in for a toyota or honda   which i did not consider out of a misplaced sense of brand loyalty and   quot buy american quot   but for some strange reason american car companies still lag in designing engines that are fuel efficient yet have a little zip   and the focus is not necessarily all that fuel efficient given it s lack of power   i am not impressed by the focus s fit and finish either the rear fold down sets require a very hard push to get them to lock back into place   the front hood requires the same and some of the plastic moldings inside the car fall off   it is my opinion that american car companies still believe that they can push anything on the market   i get the impression that the focus is a newly designed body with some old engine technology   this is not a knock on american manufactured cars but on american car companies   if they want to compete with the foreign car manufactures they should design and build cars that really do compete with them   then i ll gladly turn my money over to them   but for now   it s toyota or honda i ll admit that on the highway the car handles like a larger car but that s part of the problem built in a large car feel without approximating anything like a large car s power   as to who should buy this vehicle   well   if you live in the plain states and don t mind an unresponsive gas pedal   but very responsive brake pedal and don t have to deal with even moderately sloping hills than you are probably okay   on the other hand   if you live in the pocono or catskill mountains   not to mention the rockies   or if you appreciate good highway acceleration forget about this car   i purchased the extended warranty for this car but i am about to ask for a prorated refund on it as i certainly do not intend on keeping this car for anywhere near the    miles that is covers   shame on me for buying it   shame on for making it bob hastings   
664,0,  summary    focus wagon se   aptly fills the void between gas guzzling minivans and undersized hatchbacks b we bought this car because b we bought the   focus wagon se   because we had   dollars   that expired june     the focus was really the only that had come along in a long time that interested me   the previous small car wagon   the escort wagon   was adequate   but i wanted more   i d rented a   windstar   on a long vacation trip   and was impressed with the room and comfort   but highly unimpressed with the gas mileage   this was before gas prices went up    as well   for a daily driver   and a long commute car   i needed something small   but comfortable   i was also sold on the wagon style   because i had such good experience with my   honda wagon   we ordered anti lock brakes and the side impact air bag   as well   expensive options   but worth it    what i love b    solid body structure   almost like a volkswagen   except with about   pounds less noise insulation   also   unlike the volkswagen passat   the focus has so far been extremely reliable   in the   km i ve driven it   that works out to about    miles     there s enough trunk room for a large baby stroller and tons of groceries    there s plenty of headroom   you can wear a stetson or a foam liberty tiara if you re heading off to a sporting event    the driver s seat goes up and down by turning a well placed dial under the seat     the radio is above the climate controls   and is easy to read     the steering wheel feels solid and thick    handling and gas mileage are superb    what i hate b i    shopping bag hooks i this is sort of a love hate feature   i love the shopping bag hooks for grocery bags on the walls of the rear cargo area   i hate the shopping bag hooks   because you almost have to cut the bags off to release them from the hooks   especially after a bumpy driveway ride has seated them more firmly on the hooks i    the cruise control i when engaged   the cruise control accelerates roughly   km h and then locks onto that speed   when you get used to it   you can actually use this to your advantage   but it does take some getting used to i    turn signal colour   i don t especially like rear turn signals that are red   i prefer yellow   the focus wagon s are red   que sera sera b what i m unsure about b i    power i i m not sure i like the power of the car   it s relatively underpowered compared to my   toyota camry   even though they have the same size engine    litres   this is still the case   even after    km i    odd humming i the front tires have developed an odd droning sound at    km per hour   and again just above   km h   maybe the rotation at   km will take care of that    note   it has not taken care of it   check back here when we replace the tires after a hundred thousand kilometres or so i    fluid leak i there s a slight burning fluid smell when i do the usual sharp turns in our driveway   this has mostly subsided   although there is still the occasional scorched smell i    coffee grinding i the anti lock brakes work   although it sounds like you re grinding coffee with your brakes when it does engage   hey   anything that helps me stop in slippery weather is fine by me   i think i m leaning towards   liking   this feature    the recall b i part i   a lot of focuses were recalled a few months back   for three things      was interior trim corrections      was brake related   in that brakes would lock up and wheels fall off      was cruise control related   in that the throttle would jam open occasionally   check with your dealer to see if your car is affected    part ii   our car was the subject of a recall about   months ago   in february   to fix a possible safety failure in the rear seat hinge   if the back seat was folded down   and weight put on the forward part of the back seat   the hinge that holds the rear seat down might become disengaged   we ve never experienced this ourselves   when the rear seat is reclined again   and in the event of a crash   the rear seat might fly forward   the recall service called for is the replacement of the rear seat hinge   the repair takes about half an hour b what it s like to drive b no one will stop you on the street and ask you where you bought your car   it s not like you re driving a ferrari   or one of those new swoopy celicas   you re driving a   it looks nice   lots of people are going to drive them soon   has always put a little extra effort into the styling of their station wagons   and i like it   the handling of the car is very forgiving   take a turn too sharp   and you ll get plenty of warning before the car does something evil   driving this car quickly   because of the high seating position   feels like you re going about   km h faster than you are   adjust   slow down   relax   not a lot of tire noise coming from the wheels   except for the aforementioned droning at certain speeds   it handles bumps well   exhibits the typical wagon bounciness in the back end   a casualty of a flat loading floor   and corners well    you should buy this car if b     you want a practical car that carries a lot of stuff   but don t want to spend a lot of money on gas b you should not buy this car if b     you ve hit the mid life crisis   if that s the case   go for the sportier engine option     you ve always wanted to trick up your car with an exhaust the width of a beer can   i suppose it can be done   but why     you need a   lot   of space   a lot of the time   buy a minivan b conclusion b we re happy with our purchase   so far   i expect to put about    km     miles   on this car   so i ll give updates every once in a while    service update march      after    km    months of service i sway bar bushings   we took the focus wagon into our dealer because of a vibration in the wheels at speeds exceeding   km h   also   in between us making the appointment and taking it in   i noticed a rattling in the front of the car when going over bumpy roads   we have a lot in our area   the vibration was as a result of dirt and small pebbles that had built up on the rims of the wheels   i ll be washing off those with a hose in the future   and was easily fixed   the rattling noise was harder to diagnose   but eventually   we found that there was excessive play in the sway bar bushings   these bushings are plastic   and are not normally required to handle high loads   but in our country dirt roads   we occasionally hit a bump when the bushing is under load   the bushings were replaced under warranty   i ll be looking into getting an extended warranty   i think    engine   performance   fuel economy   after    km   the engine is as tight as it was when delivered   there is no excessive noise coming from the engine bay   and acceleration is better than when first delivered   fuel economy has improved   and we regularly get   km from a tank of gas   we could probably get more   but i get nervous when the gas gauge indicator gets below the e b service update may th   i have started noticing a hesitation in the transmission   on startup   when shifting out of park and into drive   or after switching from reverse to forward   it feels like the transmission is slipping a bit   and then it catches   if this persists   i will bring it in for a checkup   other than that   the car is chugging along well   fuel economy slightly improved   i get about   km from a tank of gas   this may be consistent with warmer weather as well   however   there is a ticking noise under the hood at idle that i don t recall being there last year   i will keep an eye on it    service update   february      we re coming up on the   year mark for our wagon   and have weathered a few more glitches   but in general   i remain pretty pleased with the performance with the wagon   turns out   i had a chance to own a second wagon   our vanagon caught fire   and turned it down for a slightly older taurus wagon   one of the deciding factors was the slightly out there green colour of the focus wagon i looked at   and of course   the desire for a bit of variety   in any case   here are the additional problems that have cropped up over the last few years b rear door misalignment   we noticed that the driver s side rear quarter panel was experiencing some abrasion on the side in front of the rear tire   to the point where bare metal was showing   the dealer pointed out that it was likely due to the rear door being slightly out of alignment   i asked it that would be covered under warranty   we were over the    km mark at this point   technically out of warranty   and were told   no   they adjusted the door   and now it s difficult to close   sometimes requiring   slams to get it closed   but hey   there s no more abrasion of gravel on that side of the car except for b paint chips missing from behind front wheel   i don t know if a particularly energetic touchless car wash   or our attempts to extricate ourselves from getting stuck in our driveway   or just poor paint quality is responsible   but the paint on the lower body panel directly behind the driver s front tire is chipping badly   i may invest in mudguards   after i get it repainted    faulty fuel sending module causes stalls after sharp right turns   in a technical service bulletin read to me at the dealership   says that some drivers of the focus may encounter loss of power if   a   the car has less than half a tank of fuel b   the car has just finished a sharp sustained right turn   and or c   under sharp acceleration this has happened to us   the official explanation is that the fuel sending module has debris in it   my unofficial explanation is that there s a faulty part in there   and should be offering to replace it   in my mind   it s a clear safety concern   and should be replaced under recall with no cost to us   the consumer   in waiting for this to happen   i make sure   as much as possible   that i take right turns slowly   accelerate smoothly   and keep the tank over the halfway mark    major repairs to date     some major brake work   at the    km mark required about    us in parts and labour     replacement of   tires   this happened at just over    km   not bad   i replaced them with cheapies that have given good service over the last    km   and that s it   other than oil changes   the ignition wires were inspected at the major tune up at    km   and found ok   so they were left in there   this winter has been especially cold   and the block heater s been used many times   successfully   the only drawback of this car in the winter is the lack of obvious towing hookup points for tractors to grab on to to get you out of ditches  
665,0,  my current   and definitive   impression about the focus was by renting it while my vw jetta vr needed some repair   while they were doing the forms at enterprise   i ve seen a focus just being parked and i immediately remembered that this was one of my choices for buying a new car   i was very preoccupied at that time   i asked to have it and i did   the first reaction somebody must have seating for the first time in driver s seat should be   how could this car have such a cheap small interior   while looking spacious from outside   the only answer to this is for me is its poor design   which suggests a waste of space and volume   why having a huge trunk when the passengers in the back seats are staying with the knees at their mouths   this car is definitely too raised from its back   forcing the driver to see the road like being on a horseback   due to this   the rear view is limited   not talking about turning you head for changing lanes on a highway   you wo nt see much   so pay attention to the traffic ahead the second feedback comes immediately after the engine starts   you have to speak louder than in the previous car you drove   its engine is very noisy and struggles each time you ask for more than riding on a   miles restricted road    avoid climbing hills   must be a warning in the owner s manual   lets assume you finally drive at full speed but orange county s traffic   like usually   stops sudden   i can bet you ll be asking yourself if the car will come at full stop before touching the lexus is front of you and at last   it has a feature that is rather a bug   the automatic switches from d rive   to n eutral   without pushing the unlock button   and fairly easy   if you would drive with   miles on highway and accidentally you ll push it   don t be surprised to be hit from the back   there were no brake lights to warn for sudden drop of speed   i didn t mean to compare a beauty like vw with the focus   because they can not be even associated   it was for me just another reason to appreciate the german engineering and the serious way in which they understand to build vehicles   the jetta was   and continues to be a wonder to me   that never stops amazing its driver   i just asked myself how a   car   like focus could be manufactured in the year    and when i am thinking that i had for a while the idea to pay money for it   
666,0,  this car is terrible   it is falling apart and even customer service does not care   i have   miles on it and it has already spent a total of   days in the shop   a major leak not only soiled the interior   but destroyed the air conditioning which was entirely replaced by   my biggest fear is that after    i will be paying more than the car is worth to keep the thing running   i have had the brakes checked and fixed   times and entirely replaced another   and they continue to make a loud shreak every time i stop   and the car is practically new   don t trust the other reviews   anyone who says anything positive about this car either works for fords corporate offices or is a salesman do nt believe the lies   updated details   i was pleased with the car for the first week or two   but then the brakes did start to squeek   my first dealings with the people who sold me the car were at    miles   for its free first oil change   i left the vehicle for the entire day   and they had done nothing with it when i went to pick it up   it was brought in and left for two more days and the brakes were said to have been adjusted and the oil was changed   the brakes shrieked on the way out of the dealership driveway then   it rained for one of the first times in months   probably the first heavy rains my focus had seen because the southeast is in a drought   i went inside the parked focus to get something off the floor and everything was wet on the front passenger side   there was a steady stream flowing from behind the glove box   the focus was immediately take to the dealership where it was purchased   the service advisors were extremely rude and unhelpful   laughing that it would be   days til the car would be fixed for the leak   i left the vehicle in their hands anyway   in order to fix the squeaky brakes again   on my way out i spoke with the dealerships gm   who is one of my clients   and he flat out lied to me that he had not heard of such leaks   even though the service advisors admitted receiving several cars with such leakage i picked the focus up three days later to find the brake pads replaced and still squeaking   the leak problem not even addressed   and the car with only   miles on it   later that day we discoved that not only would the air conditioning not work   but the mechanism would not blow air out either   several days later the sad little vehicle was taken to a different dealership where it would remain for ten days straight   during this period we requested a loaner or rental car and were laughed at   ten days without a car is a long time   believe me   when the focus was picked up from the dealership it had had the leak sealed   the ac unit completely replaced   and the brakes replaced   the brakes continued to squeak and shriek   two or three weeks later came the recalls   that i have still not been notified of   but have verified by calling customer no service   the brake problem continues   when i reach    miles the pads no longer are covered and i am told that is developing a new focus specific brake pad that will not squeak   but will they develope and install these pads at no charge on top of all this there are the little things     the trunk does not fit into the body of the car properly    there are about    parts floating around the floor of the car that have fallen off and have no aparent home    we found lose and unattatched bolts under the hood that must have been forgotten at the factory otherwise   this might be a good car     
667,0,  o k   let me tell you about this car and my experiences first of all it was a focus se with the zetec engine which is more peppy than the    and had an automatic transmission this car spent a good portion of it s life mingling with mechanics during the nine month s i owned it which made me a little jealous the car had squeaks in the suspension which made it seem like i was paying    a month for an old   s model vehicle the brakes squeaked door trim had to be replaced trunk locked in place and had to be broken into to fix it a recall for something in the rear wheel area drivers door not aligned properly and was rubbing the paint on the rear door radio would go up in volume when you put it into park and had to be re programed and last but not least me and my wife along with my three daughters were riding around one night when all of a sudden the transmission went crazy the car started trying to stall and lights were going off and on which turned out to be a connector to the computer coming loose due the fact a tab that held it in place was broken i became heart broken to realize that this car was in love with mechanics so much so that i did not get to drive it as much as they did the only focus i really had was focusing on the eyes of a mechanic to tell him all the cars problems so with all this said i let the car go and bought me a v   convertible that was not in love with any mechanics whatsoever  
668,0,  the new focus came highly recommended to me when i was looking to buy my first new car   i researched its history and found that it received great reviews for comfort and safety during its european release   test driving the car   i found it to be comfortable   well equipped and stylish   i have now driven the car for for   months and have put only   miles on it   while i have been happy with the overall performance of the car   i have been sorely disappointed with the workmanship involved   realizing that   new models   are notorious for having   manufacturing bugs   i felt somewhat reassured that these would have been worked out from    during the first european release   i was wrong   my car has been in the repair shop a total of five times for manufacturer s defects including a flooded passenger compartment   repaired twice to date   faulty master clutch cylinder   misaligned striker plate on seat back latch   broken break switch and cruise control   while i really love my car   i would hesitate to recommend it to any but my worst enemies   time will tell if the problems my focus has had are unique or are related to intrinsic design flaws br br  
669,0,  we bought the focus zts sedan because my wife needed an economical car to haul the grandkids around with   we traded in a    explorer with a   speed just before the firestone tire fiasco became public my wife loves driving the car   although it is a bit small for me     quot     lbs   it is ok   the car handles great   and with the zetec engine   it has adequate performance   although i wouldn t want any less   quot go quot   than it s got now for the problems    the main one of which is because i do my own oil changes   a particular sore point for me with most cars is that the manufacturers don t make it easy to change the oil and filter without creating a mess   this new focus is particularly bad first   the owners manual indicates a motocraft fl filter   the car had an fl on it   which some ham fisted factory idiot had torqued to about a million foot pounds   i had to use some very large pliers and turn the filter almost    turn before it was loose enough to move by hand   poor quality control the filter happens to be mounted in a horizontal position and is almost flush with the side of the engine   when i finally got it loose   oil ran down the side of the engine   onto the drive axle   onto the frame   down my arm   and all over the driveway   very bad design   on other cars   i have been able to use a cut off soda bottle placed over the filter to catch the drips   on the focus    it won t work the hood on this car is aluminum   it bends very easy    mine already has a dent in it    and i didn t have an accident   a minor problem is the power windows   they won t operate with the key in the accessory position   tilt wheel also difficult to operate bottom line    only    miles on this car   but it s going to get traded off as soon as possible for a vehicle with a little more   quot substance quot   and which is easier to maintain   i ve owned   fords since     still have    if all the newer fords are made this way   the focus may be the last product i buy br br  
670,0,  recently i had the need to rent a car   i picked the focus   i was amazed with this car   i liked it better than my own   more expensive   toyota corolla le   the steering wheel is not only height adjustable   but also telescopes   something you do not normally find on such a reasonably priced car   the drivers seat also adjusted forward and back and in height   nice feature for someone tall like myself   the front seats were roomy and comfortable and the back seat had i think the most leg room i have ever seen in a compact car the stereo sounded good considering it was stock   and the face of the radio has an upward tilt to it so that it is driver friendly   all the bells and whistles were located within easy reach and the air worked well in addition to having a roomy trunk   there are    split rear seats   child safety seat anchors and shoulder harness seat belts for   passengers i rented the   door sedan   but there are   body styles   the   door sedan    door wagon and a sporty little hatch back   i have read the safety ratings for the hatch back and from what i recall it got   stars this car is definately on my list of cars to consider purchasing in the near future   you should take a look at it too br br  
671,0,  i rented myself a focus in st   louis for a three day weekend trip for a wedding in may   so i don t own this car   but did drive it quite a bit during that weekend   this is a largely plastic feeling car   its interior was very plastic y and felt like i was trapped in a plastic box   its power was very unimpressive   making a labored sound on acceleration   it did handle quite well   likely in large part due to its somewhat compact size   the seating was somewhat cramped for me   a problem i often get even though i am only a shade over six feet tall   the car seat didn t go far enough back as i would have liked   the trunk was surprisingly large and there were lots of small compartments inside the car for stowing drinks   maps   etc   i liked that part a lot   the mileage was great   thanks to the car s small size and powerless engine   i am used to a   year old acura integra with about    miles   which gets good mileage but still has a lot more pep and life than this almost brand new focus   i went into the car with an open mind   hoping that maybe this could be a car that i would consider buying   i don t list it as a maybe anymore     
672,0,  i thought the focus sedan was the ugliest car i had ever seen the first time i laid eyes on it   i was never so happy as when my best friend got rid of this rental car   of course at this time i had not yet seen the hatchbacks   and as of now i have not had the misfortune to be in one either   now in this car s defense   it does handle well on sharp turns and i was in a base model   so this review is about the base model only   in further defense   the car is relatively quiet while driving it   i can think of absolutely nothing else positive to say about this car aside from it s ugliness   with a huge back end and odd shape    unless you get the hatchback which simply looks like a rectangle on wheels   the tiny   high back window reduces visibility to the sides making lane changes difficult   the car does come equipped with all required safety features    i can understand why the car is also designed backwards   it really is   the window rolls down in the wrong direction   the controls are different from other cars   the locks are very difficult to use   there is no center console   the dashboard is slanted downward so nothing will stay on it   and the glove compartment is under the dashboard so the passenger has to move the seat back to access it   i don t think the car could have been designed to be more inconvenient if it were done on purpose my last gripe about this car is the fact that it gives off a huge amount of static electricity   this is a problem that i don t have very often with other cars   and if i do it is a small shock here and there   with the focus   my friends and i got a very painful   loud electric shock every time we exited the car   all of my friends had the same problem   and there was never a time it did not happen   now i m not a physicist   and i don t know what is going on to cause this   but i know i can t live with being zapped every time i get out of my car   and for this and all the other reasons above i would never recommend the focus br br  
673,0,  i bought mine for the same reasons other people bought theirs   good driving manners and good looks   lots of room and easy to get into   and of course the price    miles later i have traded it     two recalls so far and a third on the nhsta website concerning the frame    windshield distorted and scratched   wind noise and tire noise unbearable   overdrive switch didn t work     three times to fix wet floorboards   windshield leaking and air conditioner case leaking into cabin   still not fixed when i traded it i also have data from other people in my area who bought a focus around the same time   and have had similar and worse problems   especially the wet floor   which i have seen for myself   i called corporate and they say they are still working on the air conditioner problem   no solution yet and finally finding out what it is really worth   when i tried to trade it at other dealers who knew about the problems   the only place i could get a decent deal was at the same dealer who sold the focus   i bought a tried and true truck   life goes on br br  
674,0,  i recently receive a piece of mail no car owner wants to see arrived in my mailbox   a recall   i admit that when i purchased my focus zx back in late august     the dealer and service center both offered assurance that any prior recalls to this car would not pertain to my recent purchase   i was quick to put up an epinion about how fun the car is around the block and   yes i will admit it is a fun car to drive   but now i am concerned about the future of this car   i will get to the letter in a moment   but first here are some cons and pros about the   focus zx cons    the car s interior lighting is not a plus   since the only light available inside the   model is above the rearview mirror   this makes it especially difficult to see things in the back seat at night   without using a flashlight    the front seats in the zx fold forward in an awkward way   making it slightly difficult for occupants to enter and exit the back seat    at speeds around   mph there is noticeable wind noise that emits from the door panels    the glove box could use a light    slight odor from ac when condensation builds up within the unit     this recall coupled with the other recalls has had on the focus pros    the zx is a comfortable vehicle to drive    gas mileage hovers between    mpg    thick steering wheel with easy to access horn   allows for ease when cornering    large front window allows for great visibility    responsive transmission   referring to manual on zx    bright headlights coupled with factory installed fog lights offer driver increased visibility on dark roads    controls are laid out in concise manner    driver and passenger seat reclines comfortably    tight suspension gives the zx a sporty feel on the road    good value for the money   on december     i received an envelope from with those three dreaded words   safety recall notice   printed above my address   inside the envelope i found a letter stating the following piece of information    copied directly from the letter sent to me    quot this notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the national traffic and vehicle safety act   has decided that certain   focus vehicles fail to the requirements specified in the federal vehicles safety standard   fmvss   no     occupant protection in interior impacts   testing indicates that certain   model year focus vehicles may not comply with the fmvss   interior head impact requirements at the top of the a pillar   in the event of an accident   and occupant contacting that location may not be provided the interior impact protection intended quot   let me pause here for a moment and reflect upon the the first sentence of the last paragraph   why was i driving around in this vehicle that had not been tested for this problem before i even bought the car   i mean we are only talking about protecting peoples heads   so how does plan to resolve this problem   they state in the letter    quot the dealer will replace both left and right hand a pillar trim panels on your vehicle quot   the letter continues    quot will repair your vehicle free of charge   parts and labor quot   uhhh   i believe this is a standard protocol in the business world   if you break it or sell it broke   the seller is responsible for all costs in correcting the defect   the letter states that the time of repair should last less than one half day   it also warns that it might take longer if schedules are tight at the dealership   call the dealership first and check to see if they have the parts in stock for safety recall oos   the parts can take up to a week to order   does not like to make it known   but some dealerships will provide you with a rental car at no charge if you can convince them that the vehicle you are leaving is your only way of transportation   the letter does assure that if you do not have this letter of recall   that the dealer will still do the work   parts and labor   free of charge   owners can also receive a refund if they have already had this work done at their own expense before the time of the recall letter   the receipt must go to the dealer and not directly   the letter states that more information may be attained through ownerconnection in conclusion   i have provided you this information as assistance if you are considering the focus   i still like my zx   but i unfortunately can no longer give the little car   stars   and if any new recalls become known   which is very likely   seeing this car s trend towards recalls   another star will be removed   what new discoveries will find as safety problems in the future   only time will tell   well actually proper testing works better   at this time   i can not recommend this vehicle to potential buyers   mainly because of s oversight to critical safety has caused me to lose a bit of faith in the br br  
675,0,  my focus zx    speed manual   though a scant   mos   old   is a never ending source of regret   in the ensuing    miles   the car has been at the dealership for fifteen days   and their alleged   quot fixes quot   never took   the transmission problems remain   even after replacing nearly every major component therein   cluster shaft   input shaft    main bearings   and let s not forget to mention the dealer inflicted body damage requiring the repairing and repainting of a front quarter panel   service managers   customer service mangers   and regional representatives are no help   too many problems   too many phone calls   too many trips to the dealership   too many meaningless apologies   if my experiences are any indication   anyone who values their hard earned money should steer clear of the focus   and of   you can bet that in the future   i will br br  
676,0,  i bought the   focus se sedan model in feb     in april    there was a recall on the injector pressure sensor then in aug     the car has what the dealership has termed a   quot lean skip quot   related to the transmission   which they state is   quot normal quot   for the focus   which in laymans terms is a hesitation and bucking in the vehicle in    gear   which is not normal for any vehicle   now in oct     there is another recall for the left wheel bearing which   cars have lost their wheel off the vehicle while driving   there have also been two other little things this car has had for trouble   the rear trunk release doesn t always release from inside on the first try   and the gas gauge also did not register a couple of times a full tank of gas minor in comparison   however annoying nonetheless   i would not recommend this car   wish i could sell mine and find something better some car of the year over here   maybe the european ones were better   however   ours aren t   i am very disappointed in the vehicle br br  
677,0,  i have    miles on my   focus zts   at first it was wonderful    mpg and handled like a dream   that dream is now a nightmare   after   trips to various dealers   the car is now dangerous to drive    the car shakes violently if you attempt to stop at highway speeds   i purchased the car at joe myers and they won t return my calls   planet refused to do anything   despite a letter from telling me to contact planet   tomball is only willing to service the car a seventh time   everyone i contact at doesn t deal with customers or if they deal with customers   they only take your name and number for the record   if you own a reliable focus   then i envy you   i suggest you think twice before purchasing a focus   doesn t take responsibility for its mistakes   update    tomball took car and i now drive a   focus zx instead   provided assistance that almost paid off the   focus zts   as well as assistance toward a   year      mile extended warranty   and oddly enough   it s not a esp   with    financing i have a new car and lower monthly payments   i ll try to provide updates about the reliability of this replacement vehicle   i remain skeptical  
678,0,  driving a focus rent a car while mine is in the shop   at first i was thrilled to have the chance to drive one of these cars   the reviews in european car and car and driver magazine led me to think it would be a very pleasant experience   much to my dismay i had forgotten that rent a cars are bottom of the barrel in features   what i fast discovered was that although a functional car   the base model with an automatic transmission leaves worlds to be desired   this is an econo box pure and simple   the transmission is not at all smooth   acceleration is either hardly there or jerk shift slam you into your seat and in your face   though i think the slam you in your seat feeling is more from the abrupt transmission than from the raw power provided by this little   banger engine   interior space is limited   with my daughter in a child seat and my seat pushed back to a comfortable distance   i m only ft   she can easily touch the seat backs with her feet   no way you could get two adults in the back seat of this thing   the trunk is small as compared to my   jetta   but the low liftover height and the fairly square shape   make the space very useable fit and finish seem quite good   better than many gm rent a cars i ve experienced i expect that the uprated car with a stick shift would be quite pleasant   since even with all the negatives about this base model   a little bit of a well designed   fun to drive car keeps peeking through   i hope has the gumption to bring the even hotter models from europe to the u s   with a hot engine and a better tuned suspension i could be inclined to overlook the unusual appearance of this car   i guess in the end this is a fairly well sorted car esp   for the money   however   it still can t compare to the fit and finish   quality or fun to drive quotient of the europeans   i think the premium paid for a vw is well worth the   br br  
679,0,  okay   retraction time is here when i wrote my original opinion on my new focus i was looking through rose colored glasses    actually autumn orange glasses   the car felt solid and responsive   looked cool and was inexpensive to operate that didn t last long in the very short time i have owned this car it has been recalled   times fortunately for me only   affected mine   zx i won t go into detail here   you can see all the recalls on the nhtsa web site the final straw came when the alternator started to go out   the lights would dim or   quot pulse quot   sometimes they would blink on and off   the real scary part was ocassionally you could actually see the firing order of the spark plugs in the dashboard lights    no   i m not a child of the   s i must commend sales for an excellent job of reeling me in that in itself is not a bad thing   i admire a good sales person   it s when the sale isn t backed by good service that sets the tone for the rest of your relationship with the dealer   parts were practically non existent and the service department personnel at   different dealerships seemed less than enthusiastic   too bad for    great news for volkswagen   vw took that pathetic car off of my hands and i now enjoy the nimble responsiveness and quality workmanship of a   new beetle gls   it is about     more on the sticker but not having to worry about what new problem lay ahead is so worth the price i can t describe the feeling br br  
680,0,  four recalls    mayor recalls squeaky wheels from the get go a strange tremor when the car goes slow leaking on passenger floor electrical problem with a speaker not even a year old and i am not even going into the little stuff and customer service   third world attitude extremely rude   must suck to work for misinformed no loaner cars no effective repairs they are really working hard at getting rid of their current client base why is the american public still fooled by thank goodness i leased because had i paid to own this car   once the warranty goes   i would have to be paying every other month for one thing or another   it is scary   the car is impressive at first   but i would like to know how many people out there are applying for the lemon laws on this one  
681,0,  i have had my focus since february of   and have not been satisfied with it at all   i have already been to the service center   times and will be going back next week since my parts had to be special ordered   i have needed brake shoes a new passenger seat belt   and my radio hasn t worked in months   i believe that the stereo was supposed to be one of the biggest selling features of the sony limited edition model   well it has only worked properly for around the first two months of owning the car   i normally by foreign cars and have for years now   but i decided i wanted a change   i have regretted it ever since and can t wait till it is paid for so i can trade it in   there is no way i will make it through the next   years with it   i just don t see it being reliable   like i said earlier i ve only had mine for approximately   months and i ve already needed brakes   that s pretty scary   i wouldn t recommend buying one especially not from sam galloway   i m not impressed br br  
682,0,  i never really drove a until my car got smashed and i needed a rental   i rented the focus se   i had no choice   it has the hp sohc engine which sounds pretty nice   personally i do nt like the styling both interior and exterior   it is too crazy for me   the exagerated wheel arches and the odd shaped tail lamps just do nt do it for me   something plain and simple such as a corrolla or protege is what i like   but if the car had other things to offer i may be able to live with it   but it does nt   it is slow   i could nt believe how slow the car was even though it was an automatic   when pinning the gas pedal the transmission seems to get confused   it takes a while for the gears to change   and its not as crisp as it should be   however   cabin noise is very minimal and the ride is smooth   when turning somewhat agressivly the tires chirp   making a right turn at kmh is all you need to get them chirping   oh yeah   visibility is poor too   even more so at night   fit and finish is poor in my opinion   things seem to be loose and not properly assembled   the car i drove had   kms on it and already the interior dome light was burnt out and the mirror adjuster was broken   the car does nt feel solid at all   maybe this car was just assembled poorly   or is it the design   i sure hope they make them sturdier in europe because the american built ones just feel like they are going to fall apart br br  
683,0,  the   nov    i bought a brand new focus zts with   speeds gearbox after   week the rear right schock was making rattle   i have to wait   months to have the part   one week after these repair   the rear right wheel bearing was very noisy   no spare parts   they borrow to me an other focus during     weeks   the time to received the part an other week after the new bearing start to make noise again i have to wait an other week to have the car repair and the last problem and also the baddest   oil contamination in the brake clutch system   no more clutch   abs light on always no spare part   now i wait since one more week   they borrow to me and other focus i like very much the handling   the brake and the apparence when the car work ok my car is always at the garage i hope my car is the exception because the focus is a nice car to have when it work now i am thinking to sale my focus br br  
684,0,  the focus has a very good ride for a small car   it is a much softer and comfortable ride than the bumpy ride typical of many small cars the car was also easy to stear and the automatic transmission ran fine the focus also has a nice sounding stereo for an inexpensive car and included a cassette player something many small cars do not the car is set up pretty well also   easy to see out of and buttons and knobs easy to reach a big issue with cars however is how well they keep their value and the frequency and price of repairs   fords in the past have not held their value as well as other cars and have needed more repairs and repairs which are proportionately more expensive than others   for example the escort which this car is replacing required the replacement of a whole light set for    when the outside plastic cover which should have cost    to replace broke   the light set did not allow for the replacement of the plastic cover alone   i do not know if the focus is similarly built one major problem with the focus was the replacement of a lost key   was unable to replace the key and said that it would take several days to get to it and they wanted     to replace a lost key     
685,0,  my focus had some of the same problems as volvinator   quot this car sucks quot   namely the leak and the brake problem   i ve had it in for the brakes twice and now they tell me that because of the high metal content in the brake pads the squeaking is unavoidable   i ve called customer no care and they have been unhelpful even with the best of intentions   i too am facing the    mile deadline   and one simply incompetent customer service agent even suggested that i just not drive the car so that i don t break the k barrier and all my repairs would be covered when the brake pad is developed   when will that be   next week   next month   or next year   she couldn t answer that question   at the mailbox this evening i met another focus owner who has the cruise control problem where if you put it into cruise the car gets a mind of its own and starts speeding away   she also is having the brake problem   and since she has power locks she has one door that refuses to lock when she presses the button from the driver s seat   the only outstanding aspect of this car is the gas mileage   especially while gas is so expensive   an update on     i brought my car in to fix the leak into the passenger side through the glove box one month ago   they took my car for a total of   days without offering me a rental   and when i asked   they said they don t do anything like that   i found out subsequent to this that service is required to provide a substitute car upon request   although i haven t tried it since then   so i can t vouch that they ll actually do it   well   it is now november    and today   for the first time in a long time   we got a nice steady downpour all day   i did not use my car at all today   and tonight   as i am a mere   hours away from my   day thanksgiving vacation    miles away   i notice a large   steadily growing puddle on the passenger side floor   the leak is back   and with my trip tomorrow   i have no options but to drive it to new jersey and see if northern dealers are more accommodating than southerners   again   just one more reason that i am disappointed with my decision to purchase this car   stay tuned for more details when i try to bring it in again br br  
686,0,  it s a good car   a great concept   and a faulty execution okay   it has a lot more room than one should expect in a compact design   it probably saves more gas than it uses   and it is light years ahead of its predecessor in style and design yet   it has some true flaws   nvh    noise vibration and harshness    come on guys   compare this to the toyota corolla or honda civic    it needs a more refined engine    manual transmission    if a   cyl engine is going to properly perform   it needs to marry its transmission   not just shack up in a drunken stupor for the evening   the stick shift on this car is baulky   with a heavy feel and a lack of convincing precision   once again    learn from honda and toyota insufficient road isolation    understandably   it s a small   cyl car    yeat more could be done to make it more than a   hour drive   i wouldn t want to do the cross country thing with it br br  
687,0,  our families have always bought cars and trucks   we have always been treated good until now   my husband and i love this car   we bought this car in october    however   after having the car for a month we were in a car accident   we took the car to be repaired in dec     ten weeks after turning in the car in for repair   is still not releasing the parts to repair the car   how can they sell a brand new car but not have the parts available to repair it   this makes no sense to me   we will never buy another again especially after the way we have been treated   poor customer service br br  
688,0,  i am the victim of a   focus zts   it s tragic that it is such a pleasant car to drive   how could a   nice car to drive   be tragic   you ask   well   i have made two payments on the car and i have had two repairs on it   one rusty muffler   and a two hour stay in the dealer waiting room between the hours of am and am   a faulty window which required two visits because of a mis judgement of the problem by the service techs   i think he said the car would be done by pm   it was done at pm   days later   now i find myself frustrated since my door locks won t lock and there is a creaky sound coming from my front suspension whenever i go over a bump   oh well   only   payments left   looks like i ll be spending more time in the waiting room  
689,0,  i purchased a   probe se in april   with    miles on the odometer for      it now has about    miles   the reviews were very positive   giving it an excellent rating for performance and fun to drive as well as reliability   i don t trust with making quality products but since the probe is built by mazda   i was more willing to believe it   after a test drive on the highway it was clear that it lives up to the promise   the steering is responsive and assuring   the    i   paired with an automatic transmission doesn t make the se a street racer but has enough power for casual commuting   the front seats are comfortable and there is plenty of room to accommodate two tall adults in front   the probe is also very pleasing to the eye   inside and out   in my opinion   it looks better than any of the vehicles   integra   eclipse   etc   it competed with before stopped production in    visibility is excellent   but the side mirrors are small and should be very carefully adjusted to avoid not seeing a vehicle in the next lane when changing lanes although the design and performance of probe is very satisfying   the same doesn t apply to the experience of owning one   i ve had to visit the shop time after time and the maintenance costs are through the roof   for the   months i ve owed the car   i had to overhaul the transmission     replace both cv axles     and the mounts     add to this expensive maintenance   replace brake rotors and disk pads   belts   etc   and i have paid nearly double the purchase price   not a good selling point another problem is the paint   my probe is a light blue metallic but the same stands for all colors   the paint chips and scratches very easily   it also has begun to burn out   despite all waxing and care   i live in texas   but the quality of the paint is still inexcusable   another heat related thing   the plastic vent cover under the windshield bent and broke in the middle when it heated up under the sun   now it expands and arches when i turn on the heat the sound system includes   speakers and an amplifier   the speakers are rather mediocre and don t mask the rattles very well   overall   the biggest problems of probe come from poor engineering and build quality   now that i m done with college   i m looking to sell this car in the next couple of months and get a bmw br br  
690,0,  i bought a   probe gt with only   miles on it for      i took very good care of my car   servicing it often   therefore   i was quite surprised when i had to have my engine rebuilt at    miles due to a defect in the oil system   since that time   i have experienced numerous mechanical problems   including the same one that caused my engine to need rebuilding   not only is the probe a completely unreliable car   but the cost of maintenance is insane   within the past three months   my car has needed more than     worth of work   just for the compressor   yes   the a c has gone out   a water pump   and an o sensor   there is a reason that discontinued it s probes   and that s because they are all poorly manufactured pieces of junk   i will say that it has excellent pickup   handles tightly   also in rain   is quite safe   and fun to drive    when it is running   however   after this experience   i will never buy another again br br  
691,1,  some of you might have read my previous post on the taurus   some might not have   right now i m at my wit s end i took my   taurus se to the shop for warranty work   the vehicle has    miles on it quality used to be job one at   i d say that s the least of their concerns right now one of the warranty issues i have with is the display on my car stereo blinks on and off   the radio worked fine   as far as sound went   but the visual display had a short or something in it   i thought taking it in and having it fixed would be a simple task   unfortunately   i was wrong they kept my car for eight days   they said they couldn t just change out my radio for a new one   requires they send the old radio to the factory for repairs at the end of the eighth day   the dealership contacted me to say my car was ready   and to come pick it up   i went ahead   picked the car up   sat down in the driver s seat   put the key in the radio   and there was no display for the radio   in fact   not only was there no display   but now the sound didn t work at all   the radio was a piece of dead hardware i immediately got the service advisor over   and asked why didn t check to see if the radio was actually working before they sent the radio back   they didn t have an answer for me   and said that was stupid of to do that i thought things would go well   and overnighted the radio over and had it repaired   then overnighted the radio back   i was called today and told to come pick the car up i turned on the radio   the car seemed to run fine   fifteen minutes out of the dealership   the radio died once again i returned to the dealership   who told me that they would once again have to send the radio back to   and have work on it again   i inquired why i can t get a new radio   figuring the car is only a few months old   and they said that s not s policy   and they can work on the radio as many times as needed until the problem is resolved meanwhile   i m renting a car once again   at     a day   my dime   doesn t provide loaners unless you purchase their extended warranty   while keeps tinkering with my car stereo instead of replacing it it would seem to me that to keep a customer happy   would have just exchanged the radio after a few attempts to fix it with no avail   however   rules are rules   and the customer is set at the bottom of the food chain i would suggest you keep this in mind before purchasing a product   there are many manufacturers out there that guarantee you a free loaner without purchasing the extended warranty while the car is in the shop for warranty work br br  
692,1,  i bought my new   taurus just two months ago   but i m in love   my former car   a    mercury sable had given me so much grief that i was desperate for something new   i bought the taurus from my local dealer for   k plus tax   tag   and title   it had everything i wanted   leather seats   sunroof   cd changer   red paint job   powerful engine   i have the   valve v   duratec   i have always driven boring cars   boring to look at and boring to drive   and i thought about buying a convertible since i live at the beach   but i couldn t be happier than i am with this car   the sunroof lets me enjoy the weather without the hassle of a convertible   the engine is great    lots of pickup   the interior is comfortable and looks really rich with all the leather   the exterior design and the   quot toreador red quot   paint give it the kind of style that makes people notice it   my boyfriend drools over my car   he calls it   quot a chic car with balls quot   i have always been a fan   and this car should keep me that way for a long time   my biggest complaint so far about the car is the puny size of the gas tank   even though i m getting very good mileage    and better   i have to fill up more frequently than i did with my sable   other minor complaints   the cupholders are awkward to get to and won t hold my favorite coffee mug   and the controls for the climate control and the radio are confusing to look at    takes a few minutes to find the button you want   if you were very tall   fortunately   i m not   you might find the ceiling to be a bit low   especially since the interior is so curvy   the roof curves in right over the driver s head   this is a great car for someone who wants a sporty car that isn t too teenager ish   it s a solid   reliable with a lot of fun features br br  
693,1,  my first car was a   one of those old   clunky   ugly suckers   it ran like it looked   my second new car also was a    ok   i m a slow learner   it was a   new   fast   pretty   and prone to cruise control collapse   sudden unexplained acceleration   that would send it from   to   while you were pulling in to park against a big   solid stone building or wall      found on road dead   henry s descendants certainly earned this moniker during the s and s   their cars were pretty awful and the japanese were eating their lunch for a reason but   come the s   they seem to have redeemed themselves in one area   the taurus why   you ask   did i buy a third after getting enough lemons to open a lemonade stand   i read good reviews   the dealer made me a real deal   and when i rented one   the rental agent had no other choices than fords   so i had a forced test drive situation here   i loved it so   i bought one   it s a   se and it s mahvelous   it s comfortable   a major consideration when you drive as much as i do   it fits me   also a major consideration when you re   foot   from the waist down and   foot   from the waist up   it handles well and corrects without sending you off the other side of road   another big plus when your drive as unwell as i do in short   the taurus makes up for s past miscues and has turned me from a japanese car fan back to a lover at least until success goes to the head and they screw it up br br  
694,1,  last spring we got a new car   a   taurus   we are very happy with it   why wouldn t we be we got a great deal from priceline but the car is reliable   before this taurus   we had a   taurus for   years   older than our son   we never had any major problems with it   just a great   dependable car the taurus is roomy and a reliable car   and it is not very expensive   we usually never have to take it in for repairs   people compliment my husband on his lovely new car   why not   it is perfect i think anyone wanting to buy a new car should definetly go test drive a taurus   the people are friendly and helpful   but most importantly the car is great br br  
695,1,  recently i bought a used    taurus   the model came with a v engine   power lumbar seat   cruise control   a nice package   for the   months that i ve been driving it   its been an extreme pleasure   the v engine gives the car a sporty feel and compliments the smooth steering and turning   and personally   i like my driving to be as easy and carefree as possibly   which the well set up cruise control aids me in greatly   while breaking   even slightly   i have noticed a slight twitch to the car   which can prove irritating at times   although i m assuming this may have something to do with the fact that the car was used   also   if you intend to install a cd player in the taurus   think hard or think again   you ll have to pay     just for the cd player   no system   to get the custom designed taurus cd player installed   you have no other options because of the interior design of the car   which is smooth and satisfying to the eye   but only allows for an odd shaped cd deck   personally   i love the sleek   bold new look of the taurus   i also know many people who think the looks are   quot weird quot   and   quot showy quot   the look of the taurus was greatly changed in either    or    and i think a wonderful job was done   the trunk space was also increased   and i ve still yet to find a time when i actually need more space   overall   i ve been greatly pleased with the reliability and performance of this vehicle   the gas mileage is mediocre    mpg on my count   and the room in the back seats is nice for a compact   the safety features are also very appealing to many   front dual airbags and anti lock braking system   these features plus many others managed to get the taurus a double five star front crash test rating   the highest possible   a great car for a small family br br  
696,1,  i have always preferred products   when buying a car i expect to keep it for awhile   every i have owned has given me years of satisfaction   that is until i bought a taurus   one year after buying my car the trouble began   my wife was driving when she noticed the   quot service engine soon quot   light came on   she drove the car to the dealer and the service manager said we needed a new transmission   fortunately our warranty had not expired   as far as everything else   i am quite satisfied   it drives smoothly and the engine seems to have a lot of power   i have also been satisfied with the gas mileage   before buying a taurus it would be best to talk to the dealer about this   ask about its history of transmission problems and what is doing to correct this problem br br  
697,1,  my recent purchase of the   taurus se has been nothing short of spectacular   this car has a smooth and roomy ride   it handles well in all weather conditions and responds easily to handling on the steering wheel   there is ample room in both the front and back to easily accommodate a family of four   in addition   the child safety locks are an excellent feature to have on this vehicle   i particularly liked that there is a built in security system that comes standard on the taurus   the only drawback i have found is with the cruise control   the car operates nicely when the cruise is on   however when disengaging the cruise control it appears as if the car is still speeding up instead of slowing down   this feeling of a   quot delayed reaction quot   made me feel somewhat uneasy   my mechanic showed me documentation that other motorists have had similar comments regarding this feature   overall   i do feel this is an excellent car particularly for families   the trunk is spacious in carrying luggage for vacations and the kids certainly won t feel cramped in the back seat as the will have plenty of room for riding     
698,1,  the   taurus sports a very new look compared to the   s and below   along with major changes in exterior   the interiors have changed dramatically with redesigned radio faceplates   and a neat pop out drinkholder that also doubles as an extra passenger seat   unless of course you opt for the floor console shift   personally i like having the cup holders and extra seat the taurus also rides like a charm   driving is very smooth   driving at speeds of    you still feel as if you re travelling in slow motion   making for a nice quiet ride   of course you can drown the quiet with the nice am fm cassette radio   standard   i can trim the bass trebble to full   and max out the volume   and the sound is still quite clear and most enjoyable   unless you have tame ears the engine is also very   quot sporty quot   for a car not classified in the sports car category   you can put your foot to the floor and be in and out of traffic before your heart catches up with the rest of you   it catches nicely   and under less than ideal conditions   cars coming at you running red lights   the handling was superb   allowing full control of car without major loss of steering and braking control overall the car is a must buy if you want a sturdy car   with lots of goodies   and a great safety record not to mention it looks a lot neater that the   and below taurus s author note   this is an edit after    miles with   taurus   so far no problems   although one door is sticking a little   and the interior fan at low speed can be heard i ll have them checked next time i have my paint recoated   will try to update this epinion every    miles br br  
699,1,  i recently purchased a new   f xlt super cab x   pound package   i owned a   f xlt super cab x right before this purchase   there were many reasons why i traded the   in on this    one of the biggest reasons for the trade was the   never felt like a   quot real quot   truck   it rode more like a car and actually handled like one too   the other big reason for the trade was the   is not rated for a snowplow   i have never owned a truck that you could not put a plow on   i live in a very snowy area and a plow is a must   with the new   i had a     foot regular duty fisher plow attached   the truck rides like a truck   it handles like a truck and it works like a truck should   the best thing about the f   is i can still register it with my state of residence as a    ton truck   this saves me money and the trouble that goes along with having   quot commercial quot   plates on my private vehicle   so while i have the payload of a    ton vehicle i still have regular plates   while all this is great the truck still has an awesome appearance   best value for the money   most truck for the money   i would highly recommend this vehicle to anybody that has heavy towing or hauling to do   anybody that needs a plow or anybody that remembers the way the old trucks felt when you drove them   i would not recommend this to anybody that is concerned about fuel economy or anyone that likes a nice cushiony ride   this truck is a real truck and there are no manf out there today to compete with the s    package   do yourself a favor and check one out     
700,1,  update at    miles     our power steering lines leaked   they can not be replaced without purchasing the whole rack    pinion power steering line kit   cost us    at the dealership also   we have been having what appear to be electrical problems instrument panel lights coming on going off intermittently   our abs light   parking brake light and door ajar lights alarm constantly come on and go off   sometimes the interior van light will stay on when the ignition has been turned off   we went through all fuses    relays but could not find a problem   the dealer could not find the problem so they didn t fix it   very frustrating we decided to purchase our    windstar from a chevy dealership in    we made this decision mostly because we had just had our nd child and also own a large breed dog who occasionally will take a ride with us   in short   we wanted a roomier vehicle   not to mention our cars were now   and   years old   we also didn t want to buy a new vehicle that would depreciate as soon as we drove it off the lot   we bought several consumer books and did our research on minivans to decide which we would like   the windstar won over all others   mainly for it s safety record but also for it s price i have to say that even though my   nissan maxima was getting old   i will always miss all the features that had me   spoiled   boy   how i wish that i didn t have to keep opening the front door to lock unlock all of the other doors without using the key for each one what a pain   what feature really burns me up isn t really even an extra   option   it s is the simple fact that you can not close the outside front vents and keep the fan running without having to turn on the a c or turn the fan off completely   i can t say how many times i ve gotten behind a tractor trailor with smoke and exhaust billowing out it s stack and have had to either turn on the a c or turn off the heater just so that the smoke didn t get inside the van   every car i ve known from a escort to an acura legend has had a control for outside inside air vents on the plus side   the ride is great not at all like a   truck   it has cup holders for each row   a sliding rear seat and seats that remove easily for more cargo space   one of the best features of all is the rear a c and heat vents which help heat up or cool down the large interior faster than just using front vents   it also has stereo controls and a headset jack in the middle row great for the kids as long as they don t fight over it   it handles very well   does not sway and has a smooth ride   has very good visibility    you can see the road   not just the hood   and the anti lock brakes are excellent   i also love the fact that you don t have to   climb   up or duck down to get in so far   so good   we haven t had any major problems with our windstar   though we did purchase an extended bumper to bumper warranty from the dealer and that s probably why just our luck   only annoying break dust that makes a couple of squeaks when we back out of the driveway update   after a couple of visits to our mechanic for a noisy belt   the mechanic notified us that this is a common problem on vehicles   he told us there is really nothing we can do   this along with the noisy brakes    vent problems has us considering another make for our next purchase  
701,1,  a year ago we bought a   windstar   i have not regret the choice since   i have never had a minivan before and we started off looking at caravans   grand caravans and voyagers   i found that the caravan   amp   voyager had too little room between the back and middle seats   and the grand caravan was to large for my small frame   then i can upon the windstar   not only does it have the room i require   it also came with two captain chair in the middle not all windstars have them   but i recommend them   this left plenty of room for my   children and even my two large dogs i highly recommend this van   it is as spacious as you need and on top of that   it is one of the safest minivans on the market   it was point out to me that there is actually two latches to secure the back door   while most minivans have the single latch on the floor   this makes it less likely the back will open up in an accident   so all in all   this is the best van for your money br br  
702,1,  we traded in my saturn for a   windstar after traveling with our older son when he was an infant   the windstar drives just like a littler car like a saturn   which i still miss on occasions   but gives you much more room to pack things in   now with two children i could never imagine getting them   us and all of our stuff in the smaller car for a trip   we fill the van to the brim i feel very comfortable driving the van and have had very little maintenance trouble with it   we recently took it in for the    mile tune up and everything came out fine   the only thing that we notice is that the   quot check engine quot   light comes on frequently when we take long trips   it was explained to us that when you go up or down in elevation quickly it comes on no big deal   it goes off after the car is started several times   we have yet to replace the tires and have replaced the brakes once but they were under warranty still overall it is a great drive   we will be trading in for a new one when our lease is up in a couple years br br  
703,1,  well   since this is my first new car   i might be a bit biased   but i have had a very good experience with my ztw   the total price with taxes   extended warrenty   undercoating   and bike racks was about   canadian   i got this price with a   dollar university graduate credit from as well as a z plan discount of about   dollars   my grandfather worked for   so i can buy any car from the dealer at below cost   i will admit that the z plan price was the main reason i looked at the focus in the first place   but i have become rather impressed with the car as a whole and would buy it again if i didn t have any of the discounts   pros i previously owned a   honda civic   and with a wife   two sixty pound dogs   and two mountain bikes life was a bit cramped   my wife and i settled on the focus because we didn t want the expense of owning and maintaining an suv   but we still wanted the increased cargo space   during the christmas season i had to commute from canmore to calgary   about   kms each way   and i m amazed that i could get so much in the car   the road noise is almost non existant with the optional factory undercoating   and the milage is getting better every day if you can afford the extra price   i highly recommend getting the ztw   our dealer had a stick shift ztw on the lot   with a moon roof and we were more than happy to take it off of his hands   the moon roof can retract completely into the roof   or raise up at the back at the touch of a button   and i m finding the abs brakes combined with the traction control allows me to drive through anything   which is a blessing when dealing with the snow and ice   my wife loves the heated seats   and the cruise control is very easy to use without needing to take your eyes off the road   our dealer   metro in downtown calgary   has a connection with a rack   and supplied us with two yakima lockjaw bike racks at cost   the racks are unbelievable as far as quality   but others have reviewed the lockjaw so i won t go into any detail as with other reviews   i have to agree that has tried to think of everything   there are pockets   compartments   and features everywhere   i don t like where some of the controls are located   the parking brake is directly below the drivers armrest   making it difficult to get to   but all the controls needed while driving are easy to see and reach witt minimal distraction to the driver   and unlike our civic   the back seats are roomy   and comfortable cons my only major complaint was the factory installed dog barrier   our dogs like the taste of steering wheels   dashboards   emergency brakes   etc   etc   so we needed a dog barrier for the rear cargo area   i didn t want a cheap piece of junk from canadian tire   and was more than happy to supply one   although they couldn t show me what it looked like   or describe it in any way   even the service guys admitted they had no idea what to expect as far as installation was concerned   here s the problem the dog barrier supplied by looks like it was made to withstand a battling ram and is not removable   the dealership also needed six hours of labour to install it   requiring the removal of the back seats and two rather large holes into the side panels in the back   i have to question why would market the focus s cargo capacity   and then engineer a non removable dog barrier that completly eliminates the ability to use that cargo capacity   thankfully the dealership listened to our complaints and removed the dog barrier   replacing the back panels as well   free of charge i have also read some reviews regarding painful wind noise caused by the rear windows rolled down at highway speeds   i tried it yesterday and i must admit that there is a bit more noise than i would like   but since i have a moonroof   and air conditioning   i doubt i d ever be driving like that again so i can t complain thanks for your time   and have fun buying a new car adam price calgary
704,1,  this is just the first time has decided to put a permanent camper shell on it   i love this vehicle   and i ve never set foot in one   but i have done my research   so bear with me through this epinion this truck definitely offers its share of pros for starters   it is the biggest passenger vehicle you can own without requiring a commercial drivers license   at nineteen feet long and almost seven feet high   you can easily seat ten people and their luggage comfortably   have something to tow   this vehicle will do it   have a    lb boat   no problem   tow it up to the lake   only produced a few of these vehicles this year   so you re guaranteed a limited edition   this gives you a nice interior   towing package among many other things   where as many people agree this truck is too big   it does offer things to counter that   such as oversize mirrors   reverse sensors optional   and drop down window sills that make it easier to see out of the sides   i ve heard that the sound system is quite exceptional in this vehicle   although i don t know the exact number of speakers or the setup   has heard the cry from the compact car drivers   and they have run support bars that will keep the excursion from decapitating your metro   i ve heard people complain of parking in this vehicle   no matter how bad the steering is   you get used to it   and soon you won t even realize that you have to turn a bit more   watch a little better and swing wider than in the car   safety is a big part of this vehicles selling point   do you think anything short of a semi could hurt you in this vehicle   just remember to wear your seat belt like all vehicles   the excursion does have its share of cons i have heard it was built on the f   frame   f   frame   and f   frame   i can t seem to find the exact frame   i ve ruled out the f   frame   as that is what the expedition is on   i don t think would put their biggest vehicle on the mid sized frame   i m almost certain that the excursion is on the f   frame   the f   pick up is not know for it s comfort   it is know for getting the job done and having plenty of room to do it   so   when you notice that you re feeling more of the bumps in the road than in a car   don t be surprised   this is the more rigid suspension   which helps you to be able to tow so much or load the back of the truck version with three tons of sand   at    tons of excursion   don t expect to get good gas mileage   you ll get between   and   mpg   depending on driving conditions   this isn t that bad if you consider that you are carpooling with the best of them   with a fully loaded truck   each person is getting    so you pull off an amazing   mpg   tell that to the two person honda getting   mpg   you also have a   gallon tank   so range won t be lacking   but bring the visa to fill it up   come on   its the year    when you purchase a x version of this vehicle   be prepared to climb out in the mud to lock the hubs to get it locked into four wheel drive   this vehicle is also not cheap   expect to pay     for a stripped version and up to     for the xlt one thing to look out for   brags that the drive train is made to withstand up to   ft   lbs   of torque   the diesel version of the excursion pushes   ft   lbs   of torque   you may experience transmission problems in the long run if you need one of these vehicles   i definitely recommend it   if you are planning on using it as your daily driver   i d think otherwise   it may be best to get a small car and this vehicle to be a little more economical where as the excursion does look like a very nice vehicle   i would recommend the suburban over it any day   for starters   the suburban comes with a    liter v or a    l v   with the   cubic inch engine   i ve heard of gas mileage approaching   mpg   you ll never have to lock the hubs on the suburban   and you ll have chevy dependability to look forward to on a final note   i think nissan sums it up nicely with    quot yeah   we made it bigger quot br br  
705,1,  i spent a lot of time researching and test driving many other vehicles before i made my decision to purchase my excursion   when i first started shopping i must admit that i was not even considering the excursion   i drove practically all the suv s on the market and while at my dealership they put the explorer   expedition and excursion side by side   the excursion is indeed very big and intimidating at first   then i drove each one   to my amazement the excursion handled beautifully and much smoother than the expedition or explorer   i need a vehicle that can transport people and all their things   i also cook for   kids at a week long camp in the summer and the excursion met all my criteria and then some   i filled it from one end to the other with food for one week   this is something that i required three vehicles to accomplish in the past   it handled the load like it weighed nothing   i use it to transport kids in a carpool to and from school   the things that impressed me when i was shopping is that it meets the low emission standards for pollution in all   states   it has a blocker beam that absorbs most of the energy and keeps a smaller car from sliding under the vehicle in a crash   more than    of the vehicle can be recycled at the end of its life   and has used recycled materials in producing this vehicle   it seats all my passengers comfortably with lots of elbowroom to spare   i have had   adults in this vehicle and they were all amazed at the spaciousness of the interior and all the creature comforts   we had a pull down monitor installed in the center part of the ceiling just behind the driver s seat and a dvd player along with an electrical outlet to plug in my son s sega dreamcast in the back of the console that fits between the driver s seat and the front passenger seat   it has been a lifesaver on the long trips we have taken with the kids and their friends   this is the first year that we have traveled in peace because everyone had their own space and was not touching the person next to them it is a bit of a shock at the gas pump filling up the   gallon tank   most gas station s pumps shut off at     and it takes right around     to fill the huge tank   but i don t have to make a trip to the gas station as often as i used to with my old minivan   it averages about   miles to the gallon driving around town and about   miles to the gallon on long road trips   it took about two weeks of practice in and empty parking lot to learn to park it   it does not fit in many of the mall parking garages   you need at least    quot   of clearance room to fit in a parking garage   it fits in my home garage just fine   i have the back up sensors   i feel every vehicle should have back up sensors   it goes off if someone or a small animal walks behind the vehicle while backing up   it beeps faster as you get closer to an object and emits a solid tone when you are twelve inches away from an object or wall   it has a switch to shut the tone off while towing   it only emits the tone when you put the vehicle in reverse   i don t know how i ever lived without the seat warmers   i just recently used the four wheel drive and it was so easy   you just stop the vehicle and turn the control on the dash to the four wheel drive setting you wish to use   when you are finished you stop and turn the control back to   wheel drive   that s a big difference from when my dad used to have to climb out of his truck to put it into four wheel drive   it is a big step to climb up into it but it is nice to be able to see the roadway ahead   i know that my kids and passengers are safe   if you do not wear a seatbelt it will chime intermittently until the seat belt is fastened   i would recommend leather seats for easy cleanup   my family practically lives in this vehicle and it is so easy to clean them   you will be glad you spent the money   even with adults it is amazing how much stuff can end up on the seats   the cargo space in the back is perfect for my dog s kennels and for putting everyone s stuff   the tailgate is split in half and very light weight and easy to open   i really liked it much better than the suburban that has a bar that runs down the center of the glass   its back gate is much heavier than the excursion   i have had two hand surgeries and the excursion s back doors are a breeze to open and close   it has big mirrors that can be folded in to give more room if you are in a tight spot and people need to walk by the vehicle   the mirrors also pull out for towing   i have had many people come up to me and ask if they can see my vehicle   i even had one guy sit in it for   minutes on a ferryboat admiring everything it had to offer   he decided that he would trade up for an excursion that weekend   it takes a little getting used   i spent about a month getting used to it in some areas that were not very populated   then eased into the city   i have had my excursion since mid march of   and one day in early may    i noticed that i was truly confident in driving it   i do take a little more time in making lane changes and am very careful to check mirrors and the area around my vehicle   if anything i think i have become a more conscientious driver and i watch for areas that are more open in traffic to make maneuvers that require more time and space   the excursion is a very versatile vehicle   it can be a very comfortable car and a very hard working truck   i have had many uses for it and it has given this busy mom much more time and ease to get the big jobs done if you need to transport a lot of people and their gear or big loads of stuff   the excursion will serve you well   it takes less gas to haul   people around in an excursion than it does in two small cars   it s safe for your passengers and safer in a collision for a smaller car than any other suv out there   it is also more environmentally friendly   i read on another review of this vehicle that it emits   pounds less pollution a year than other suvs and as i said earlier more than    of the vehicle can be recycled when the car s life is over   the excursion has good things to offer and they far out weigh any of the disadvantages of owning this vehicle   it is a pleasure to drive   you just need to be a responsible driver and take the time to get to know the vehicle just like you would any other vehicle   be a safe courteous driver   leave a little earlier so that you are not in a rush to get to where you are going   don t talk on your cell phones while your vehicle is in motion   i pull over in a safe place and in my voicemail i mention i might be driving and to leave me a message and i ll call them back as soon as it is safe for me to do so   most people are very understanding of this   suvs are not all that bad   it s just the drivers that do not use their common sense while driving   any car can become an assault vehicle if the person operating it does not do so responsibly   driving is a privilege not a right   we do have the right to choose what we drive   i chose the excursion and i am willing to take on the responsibility to drive in a safe manor so that i can accomplish the tasks that i need to accomplish with it s assistance   it helps get the job done   i highly recommend it   you really have to drive it see what it is like chris

706,1,  just last year   gm had an untouched suv class   that of the suburban   a class that sold about    vehicles   one that just couldn t let go unchallenged   the answer   the new excursion   this hulking suv is now the biggest in its class   how big   well   about   tons   its about    inches wider than the suburban   and about    inches longer   its set on a f frame   and from the side looks like a van   but the front end is that of the superduty   it accelerates    in about    seconds   which is quick for a   ton vehicle   it comes with the triton v   the    v or the optional    liter powerstroke   up front it boasts two plush captain s chairs with a center console   the dash and instrument cluster is that of the f   further back   there are two rows of seats   which can fold down or be removed to give the excursion   cubic feet of cargo space over the suburban   it is       inches taller than the suburban   featuring one of the flattest cargo racks available   the rear hatch opens three ways   to cut down on those huge rear doors   the spare rests inside   neatly packed away against the driver side of the vehicle   after testdriving   i found that the ride was smooth   but firm   the x suspension is different than that of the x   but being as long as it is   high centering is a problem   even though this is a fully capable x   off road use is limited again to its size   added guards under the front bumper keeps cars from sliding under the vehicle in the case of a head on accident   even weighing   tons doesn t keep the excursion from towing around    pounds   the v sports   hp   lb ft   while the diesel comes with around   lb ft of torque   or a    triton v rated at   hp   safety is great   due to its size   what could hurt the thing besides a bus   it has a massive   gallon fuel tank   which takes upward of   dollars to fill   but it has a surprising    mile range on one fill up   the cool overhead console displays   besides other things   about how many miles you have left in your tank   price is a big factor   about k for the xlt model     for the limited   which   for the dollar   isn t a big increase from that of the explorer   or a nice f or    roll over is that of any big suv   has taken great pains to limit roll over as much as possible without sacrificing too much clearance   my personal interaction with this truck is of testdriving br br  
707,1,  my reason for considering the excursion was its size primarily   the ones i had looked at seated at least eight   when i test drove it   the ride was smooth and controlled   i have had it now for about two weeks and it is the best vehicle i have ever owned   all the instruments are within reach and i am a very small female   the seats are adjustable and heated   the space is incredible   the kids love it   the leg room is ample enough for adults to sit very comfortably all the way to the back bench seat   i traded in a   toyota forerunner   limited   for it   that was a great car too   but it didn t ride half as smooth on the road as this vehicle   one thing to watch is how long it is on the nose and on the tail   it was a bear to park the first time   but i have the hang of it now anyone who has several people to drive about needs this vehicle   it is heads and shoulders above the suburban   first of all   it is bigger   more beautiful   and a better bet as far as towing capacity   it can tow up to    pounds great buy   i got mine a limited with leather seats for around     br br  
708,1,  i own the limited version of this vehicle and also have a large family   i ve had an expedition which i was very happy with for the past two years but we are currently selling it   unfortunately our family has outgrown it   one of the reasons for buying the excursion is the extra room behind the rd seat which the expedition didn t offer   there is plenty of room for strollers   suitcases   camping gear   etc most the complaints about this vehicle is that it is too large and uses too much gas   people with large families really don t have many choices when it comes to a vehicle which is able to carry the entire load   i didn t want to buy two vehicle which together would use more gas than the excursion alone   while i knew i needed a large vehicle common sense also tells me that the gas mileage would be poor   while many people think this is by far the largest vehicle   minus semi s   buses and rvs on the road i must disclose that this is not true   the excursion is    quot   long    quot   wide and    quot   high and   lbs   the super duty crew cab   pickup is    quot   long     quot   wide    lbs   and unknown height   that s a difference of almost   quot   in length and    quot   in width   the shorter truck version is    quot   long   the   super duty crew cab is    quot   long    quot   wide and    quot   high   this is almost the same size as the excursion   the trucks and excursion obtain about the same gas mileage   mpg give or take about   mile to the gallon although the excursion power stroke engine is about   mpg   the excursion obviously weights more but it also has to protect more passengers   these figures are based on   and   truck models all seats in the excursion offer generous leg   head and elbow room   i have even sat in the rd row seat very comfortably   the seats are very comfortable for long trips i have the    l power stroke diesel engine which obtains about   mpg compared to the   mpg of the other version   personally   other than the recent spike of gas prices which is already working its way back down   i have no complaints in the amount of gas i need to buy   the   mpg is very comparable to the many mini vans on the road once you familiarize yourself with this vehicle   it s surprisingly maneuverable and easy to park   it drives and rides smoothly and handles corners with ease if you re in the market for an expedition   take your time in test driving it and contemplate what you will use it for because it isn t for everyone but i am extremely happy with it     
709,1,  there were really only two suvs that i was considering   the suburban and the excursion   after doing extensive research and test driving i realized that the excursion was in a class of its own   the is safer and larger than the suburban and was obviously designed with safety and capacity as a goal   i won t argue that the suburban is a great x but if you test drive both   and can afford the gas for the   i think you will also realize that the is the better truck   i found myself stopped behind a suburban at a traffic light when i was driving home from the dealer with my new excursion and it was at that point that i realized how much larger the is   i was blown away by the acceleration of the v   engine   it sure didn t seem like i was driving a   ton truck   this truck is meant for people who want safety   towing and cargo capacity and the great feeling of a luxury large truck br br  
710,1,  this vehicle may not be for all people but if you tow a trailer and have children this vehicle is for you   the ride is firm but not horrible   it is built on the f   chassis so don t expect a cadillac ride   i opted for the diesel which gets me   to   mpg around town and over mpg on the hwy while not towing   the fit and finish are excellent   the interior is quite comfortable and the stereo system is very good   space for carrying things is second to only a van   i really can not say much bad about this vehicle   i will say that unless you own one   keep your opinions to yourself people   this is not a site for do gooders or moral opinions   people want the hard facts   consumer reports gave it a lousy report but i think when reporting on a vehicle like this you can not compare it to the bmw or lexus suvs   sure   it takes longer to stop   it weighs lbs   consider that is nearly    heavier than those two car like suvs and its braking distance is not bad by far   it has   wheel disk brakes   load range d tires   a class hitch and will tow lbs   the diesel has plenty of get up and go and should satisfy most people   it is a bit noisy compared to the gas models  
711,1,  i have a   year old vehicle which needs to be retired   i looked for something to replace it with   at the time there was not much around which really qualified   and along came the excursion   with a king size price tag to go with it but everything else filled the bill   size   comfort   capability and everything else i could ask for   fuel mileage is tolerable at about    mpg   imp   this is not much different than the   explorer   mpg on a good day   which we traded in for the excursion   ha handling takes a bit to get used to   but once you get on to what to expect   its an absolute darling parking is initially a real experience   it takes practice   before you go shopping or towing its nice to have a large fuel tank so you don t have to keep looking for pit stops i checked out the cost of the recommended oil for the diesel and its not much more than what i had to pay before   the oil filter is a behemoth but still not extraordinarily expensive provides lots of descriptive literature in the owners manual and also provides a manual for the   l power stroke the back up beeper works as advertised   it starts beeping at about   something feet from an object   the sensors are susceptible to ice snow   and dirt so you have to keep them clean ca nt find any squeaks   rattles or other annoying noises to complain about lots of people seem to be complaining about roll in the corners but to them i say   slow down and take the corner intelligently according to what you are driving and you will find that there ain t no roll speaking of roll   there is no binding on the discs so when you take your foot off the brake   the vehicle will roll very easily from a dead stop the excursion is not for the faint of heart nor just for the rich and famous   its a well built beast and will work as advertised and last a long long time   fix or repair daily applies of course since any vehicle requires proper maintenance on a regular schedule   treat it right and you can t loose on this one br br  
712,1,  we just purchased our excursion this past week   as a past owner of a f   conversion van for over   years i have found that the excursion is not much more than what i have been driving   we purchased a car also this past year to try and keep miles of van   but i found myself going back to driving the van because i never felt safe in a car   my reason for the purchase of the excursion are   being safe   towing power    we have a ft travel trailer   room for passengers   comfort   what i am saying to this as i read many opinions about how big and unsafe it was for the excursion to be out on the road   might i add   that it is most of these small cars and trucks that are going over the speed limit and taking the chances   we   big car owners respect the roads and are more observant of our surroundings   i m sorry all you small car owners feel this way but keep your eyes on the road and off our big trucks   i might i also add there have been f    f    f   on the road for years   the only different in this truck is that it is covered   it handles like a charm   hugs the road great   and as for parking   i just park it like i did my van   as for gas   well i did not buy it for that   i knew it was not much on gas   and we have not had it yet long enough to find out   we purchased the    v limited   i have also read that people have strong feelings about the pollution problem with these big trucks   might i add to this   when you are in the cities   look around at our transit system and count how many people might be riding at that time   i have seen at times when there are maybe   people on the buses   so what do we do about this problem   as for the tilting effect   no   but then i have driven a big high top van   maybe to those who are going from a car to this may feel this   but i can not say that   as for rattles   have not heard any   and the seats are great   so as my opinion goes   no this is not a car truck   for everyone   yes it is a great driving truck   handles well   and i respect it   we did fill it up last night and our gas range was about     however that was the first fill up and we only drove it around town   we have been told once we get it broke in and out on highway we should do better   again this is only my opinion   and i hope those of you who have just purchased one enjoy it as much as i do mine   again to me it is no different than what i have always driven   just everyone   be it small car owners or large car owners   keep your eyes on the road and what you are doing and not on what someone else is driving     
713,1,  the new excursion is a huge truck with lots of room for both family and cargo   this truck has excellent power and still handles similar to an expedition or an explorer   it comes stock with a triton v   engine which will not let you down   if need room and always had a van   but want a x than this is definitely the perfect vehicle   don t worry about the comfort because this is extremely roomy   i use this truck at my work   i drive a explorer which is also and eddie bauer package   the two trucks are quite similar   since the explorer is one of the biggest sellers on the market i have a feeling that this truck will succeed because all it is   is a much larger explorer or expedition   one might say that lacks creativity but if you drive this truck you will see the differences as well as the similarities   talk about power even in x on some of the toughest trails and inclines this vehicle is not to heavy to get up a large hill   if you have a big family and a sense of adventure than this is most definitely the truck for you br br  
714,1,  we owned a   aerostar for over six years   we bought it new and sold it in   with    miles on it   we bought it because we were planning yearly vacation educational trips with children and friends and thought it would be an excellent vehicle for this purpose as well as serving as our family work vehicle   the aerostar met and far exceeded out greatest expectations   in fact   the present owners are still using it for trips to a hospital in a nearby city every week   it now has    miles on it   there is nothing to hate about this vehicle   the gas mileage was wonderful   there were no major mechanical problems during its entire stay with us   we did conduct regular maintenance   tire replacements   and so forth   the seating was most comfortable and convenient   even middle aged ladies from our church enjoyed riding with us to church conferences across the country   no one minded if they had to ride in the middle or back accommodations   in fact   the option of removing the back seat from time to time proved a helpful asset when carrying luggage   groceries   or other items   our family mechanic often stated that maintenance access was convenient for working purposes   the smooth ride   easy driving   and comfort of the vehicle are exceptional   if you are looking for a reliable vehicle that shelters people and possessions from the weather   that is easy to maintain   and easy to drive   then this aerostar is what you need to buy br br  
715,1,  we bought our used   econoline e mark iii conversion van in   from friends who didn t need the large van anymore   it had    miles on it and was in good shape inside   we have thoroughly enjoyed the van for the last two years   you can t beat it for long trips   you don t arrive at your destination feeling beat up   my kids enjoy watching movies or just being able to stretch out in all that space my concerns have only just now begun   our abs light on the dashboard started appearing randomly shortly after we purchased the van   when we checked with the midas place locally about it   they said it was okay to drive   the regular brakes would always be available and they couldn t check it unless the light was actually on   well it always goes off when the van is turned off and of course never comes on when we are close to a place that can check it   so that has been an ongoing concern   we still don t know what is wrong there now recently on a trip   of course   the   quot off quot   button on the overdrive control started flashing indicating that something was going on with the transmission   luckily we found an aamco place that was willing to take us and check it immediately   they explained that the transmission clutch was starting to slip and reset the button so that it wouldn t be flashing on our trip home   they told us that we could continue to drive it   don t push it by running on cruise control   and sometime the light would come on again   indicating problems again   but when that would be would be anybody s guess   well of course   to fix it would entail big bucks the bottom line is that we are now babying the van   trying to decide if we want to fix all the problems or buy a new one   yes we would buy a new one if we could afford it   they are wonderful vehicles and a joy to drive   once you get used to driving the size   you ll never go back to small cars   the entertainment for the kids on long trips is priceless   no more   are we there yet   or how much longer   i d recommend them to anyone in a second   and i have just as an update   it is now august   and two things have changed   we did finally get to midas and have them check out the brake light   they went over it thoroughly   and didn t charge us by the way   and couldn t find anything wrong with the brakes   the manager there told us that this is common in these vans and is probably an electrical short which they couldn t fix   kudos to midas second   the transmission light came on again as we were going on vacation   finally decided to suck it up and take it to a local nonchain transmission shop owned by an friend   he checked it over thoroughly   again for no charge   and said he wouldn t be driving the thing much longer if it was him   right now   as we speak   it is in the garage having the transmission replaced   looks like i ll be driving this one a few more years br br  
716,1,  i ve never owned a pickup   and possibly never will   but i just had to drive the redesigned f   as soon as it appeared on dealers   lots   why   s financial health has been shaky lately   and no product is more critical to this health than the s full size pickup   the f    this truck   the best selling vehicle in the u s   for the last quarter century   contributes a major chunk of s sales and profits   consequently   as goes the new truck   so goes the   well aware of the stakes   spared little when fully redesigning its large pickup for     partly as a result   the new f   is much more expensive to build than the old one   given the importance of the new f   and the amount of effort put into it   i felt compelled to check it out   since i m not used to how large trucks drive   i also drove a and for comparison note   this review is identical to that posted under the general f   heading   except that i ve added a section on reliability b many   many choices   but which one   the new f   comes in five different models   base xl   work truck   low end sporty stx   midrange xlt   which will probably be most popular   high end sporty   off road ready fx   and luxurious lariat   trim lines are just the beginning of the choices   three bodies are available   regular cab   supercab   rear seat accessed by rear hinged half doors   and supercrew   larger rear seat accessed by four conventional doors   going up one size cab will cost you about      three bed lengths are available         and   feet   the    comes in both regular and flareside styles   going up a bed size costs     while the flareside will set you back another    for   two engines are available   both vs   a largely carryover   horsepower    liter and an extensively upgraded   horsepower    liter   the latter   with three valves per cylinder and variable timing for higher efficiency and a broader torque curve   produces   foot pounds of torque at   rpm   for   there will be additional engines   includes a v and a supercharged v   a manual transmission should also be available in later years   for now   either engine hooks up to a four speed automatic   although this automatic is supposedly   new   i would expect another before too long   as and   soon   nissan offer five speed units drivetrains include rear wheel drive   mechanical shift on the fly four wheel drive   and electronic shift on the fly four wheel drive   unlike in s large suvs   automatically engaging all wheel drive is not available   as in other large pickups   many different axle ratios with and without limited slip are available to suit different needs   highway economy   towing   etc   although the new truck is only available in light duty    half ton   form   suitably configured it can carry up to    pounds or tow up to    the fx and lariat come standard with a     bench like other f s   but as an option they offer buckets separated by a full center console that flows cleanly into the dash and mounts the shifter   a first in this class    even the performance oriented chevy silverado ss has a column mounted shifter   this option is less practical   but to a car guy like myself it takes full size pickups in a whole new direction although every possible combination of the above is not available   the range of variants is staggering and will only become more so in later years as additional powertrains are added further complicating matters this year   the old f   will continue to be sold alongside the new one   did this the last time the truck was redesigned   for the   model year   at least this time around the aesthetic jump is not as drastic i m not going off road   so the faux wood trimmed   city slicker lariat probably best fits how i would use such a vehicle   but i prefer the rugged yet sophisticated styling of the fx   i also felt that the supercab with    foot standard bed represented the optimal combination of functionality and maneuverability    i suspect this configuration will be most popular with non commercial buyers   the supercrew is available only with the shortest bed   and the   foot bed is available only on the xl and xlt and makes for one ungainly   inch long truck when paired with the supercab   at   inches   the supercab with    bed is already a lot of vehicle   as luck would have it   the only f   i could find to drive was this configuration    even this one might have been pre sold one salesman thought so   but the other was willfully ignorant of its status    styling   the f   s styling has been updated much like the explorer s was for   and the expedition s was for    almost too prissy for a truck curves have given way to a more formal   more massive   broader shouldered look   unlike the last time around   the new truck is not clearly a step ahead of the old one   it s just different   the new sheetmetal is much less striking than the    a href content   ram s a b    click for my review   and even less distinctive than the aero influenced old truck s   but to my eye it is the most refined and handsome among large pickups   it is hard to imagine it ever looking old or dated   already the fate of gm s current pickups   like on s heavy duty pickups the front side window dips down to lend the styling one brand specific detail and perhaps permit the large side mirrors to be mounted a bit lower   the largest wheels are s   and though no match for the cartoonish s available on the ram they further enhance the truck s bold stance while the exterior styling is clearly evolutionary   the interior is revolutionary   i ve already mentioned the available full center console   in comparison   the center console in gm s trucks   clumsily integrated with the instrument panel   looks even more pathetic than it already did   the tall   cylindrical   chrome trimmed shift lever might be a bit too space age   and it could feel smoother   but it catches the eye and demonstrates the extent of s desire to reinvent the pickup cabin   the click   square edged styling of the leather trimmed buckets looks very upscale   the pebbled texture of the fx s black   sport   leather further connotes this is one tough yet ritzy truck    want leather in something other than black   tan leather is available only in the lariat   although the xl and stx share a non tach instrument cluster   the other three trim lines have six gauge clusters that not only differ in graphics   cream faces in the lariat   for example   but in the location of the gauges   varying the latter can be costly   and i don t see the point   some subtle differences in preferences might be involved   but i imagine any of the three gauge layouts would have been fine with pretty much everyone   so perhaps they tried too hard   and have added unnecessary cost as a result aside from these interior features   what most impresses is the level of fit and finish in the interior   the materials might not be suitable for a lexus   but they re nicer than any other i ve been in   fits and seams appear very precise   which is rarer than it should be in domestic vehicles   after test driving this truck and wondering why doesn t outfit its cars this well i read a review   in   automobile    that ventured the same question   between the styling and the materials   the new f   s interior shames those in other domestic pickups b accommodations   the front buckets first impress with their size   they feel like thrones   then there is the matter of design   the comparison between them and the front seats in the competition resembles that between modern furniture and a traditional american sofa   okay   maybe not quite that large a difference   but it s getting there   these seats are considerably firmer than the pickup norm   such that you sit on them rather than in them   they possess side bolsters   but these are too widely spaced to serve any function for all but the widest people   i found these seats comfortable   but traditional pickup buyers might find them somehow foreign as expected in such a vehicle   visibility forward and to the sides is excellent   to the rear it s not so good owing to the tall   distant rear end   i would highly recommend the optional reverse sensing system   i don t see the point of such systems in most cars   but here i see the point   the truck i drove lacked this option   but based on similar systems in other vehicles i ve driven it should work well the driving position is the most carlike of the domestic trucks   the is similar   while the seat is mounted so high i found myself planting my left foot flat on the floor no need for a dead pedal   in the you could almost be in a car   if one with large seats positioned well above the ground   in the you re clearly in a truck given the truck s height off the ground   the optional tubular steps were a great help getting in and out   the and trucks i drove lacked such steps   though they are available either from the factory or aftermarket   and getting in and out was much harder   especially with the latter    the s seating position is the lowest of the three   especially if you are short or have kids   you re going to want some form of step with any of these trucks when introduced fully redesigned pickups five years ago they eclipsed the competition in rear seat comfort   for the first time offering a rear seat in an extended cab with enough knee room and enough angle to the backrest to seat adults in adequate comfort   well   the gm product is now the granddaddy of the bunch   when introduced its new truck last year   it offered an even roomier rear seat   now it s s turn to offer the best of the bunch   unlike and   offers only a single extended cab model with four conventional doors   although the supercab still uses rear hinged half doors   it contains a roomier   more comfortable rear seat than the   the supercrew rear seat offers another six inches of rear legroom   but unless the front seats will be most of the way back   i e   for tall people up front   the supercab s rear seat provides enough room for medium sized adults   and more than enough for children the supercab s rear doors might be rear hinged   but unlike before   and still in the gm products   they contain windows that fully retract rather than just pop out   one major innovation was missed   however   i ve been told that rear hinged doors can be difficult to use in parking lots   as you end up with insufficient room to move about alongside the vehicle when parked next to another vehicle with both doors open   nissan s upcoming large pickup solves this problem with a rear hinged door that opens   degrees   the s just opens about    could be an argument for the supercrew   an optional power sliding rear window is another first with this truck   no power folding rear seat   yet   though as in all large pickups beginning with the   ram   cargo compartments within the cabin are generously sized   offers an innovative track system that fits various accessories as well as storage on the ceiling   but this was replaced in the truck i drove by an optional sunroof   yes   a sunroof in a large pickup   they must really be targeting people used to cars   even regular cabs have small rear hinged doors to provide better access to an enlarged internal cargo area unlike the but like the the supercab s folding rear seat is split     unlike the   there are no nifty storage compartments beneath it   but this frees up a big more volume the new pickup beds are a couple of inches deeper than the norm   to my eye this significantly enhances their cargo volume   however   one review i ve read suggested this together with the s height   gm products sit a bit lower   makes it hard to reach into the bed and grab stuff   unfortunately   i did not check this out   but will the next time i have the chance   an innovative torsion bar makes the tailgate easier to open and close than other pickups b on the road   the styling and interior comfort of the new f   suggest a better driving truck   is this accurate the fx comes standard with the three valve     liter v   in comparison   the gm    liter produces five fewer horsepower and   fewer foot pounds of torque   the latter seems an especially significant difference   the touted   hemi     liter in the kicks out   more horses   but only ten more units of torque so in the midrange the two engines aren t far apart   the also has another gear ratio to play with   how does all of this shake out   well   even though i tested the gm engine in the avalanche   which is heavier than the silverado   it felt the perkiest of the three in normal despite having the weakest stats   both the and the have to be prodded more to get them to perk up   at full throttle the might well have the edge   but based on the seat of my pants the difference is too close to call   i suspect differences in mass counterbalance those in power   the truck i drove weighed about    pounds    glass sunroofs   step bars   the fx s standard skid plates   the stiffer longer frame such features can add serious mass   in comparison   a base gm wd extended cab truck weighs under   pounds   though the wd avalanche clocks in around     the falls between the two i also drove the silverado in   horse ss form   it s quicker bottom line   even with the revised    and optional    axle the is hardly quick   i especially expected more passing power on the highway   what the v is is quieter and smoother than the others   the produces considerably more intake roar with little provocation   while the s hemi produced so much mechanical noise at idle that i almost thought the salesman had grabbed the keys to a cummins diesel by mistake    the hemi engine will later be available in chrysler s large cars   that should be interesting given its very trucky character epa ratings are    with four wheel drive     with rear wheel drive   similar to gm s    and one mile per gallon better than s     however   word of mouth suggests that real world fuel economy is best with the gm trucks   people i know with gm trucks typically report fuel economy in the    range   those with fords in the    range   or worse   i suspect the additional weight of the trucks   which forces their engines to work harder   is to blame   claims major frame and suspension improvements for better ride and handling   the frame is nine times stiffer than the old one   while the cabs are twice as stiff   the rear springs are wider   while the shocks are mounted outside the frame   the steering is rack and pinion   a first for four wheel drive trucks    the uses rack and pinion with the rear drive chassis only   but how does it all pan out in character the new f   resembles the current expedition   body motions feel more precisely and tightly controlled than in the competition   and the steering is firmer and also more precise   lean in turns feels more restrained than in the others   especially the non ss gm products    taut   comes to mind   that said   the gm products handle more responsively and intuitively   they feel somehow more natural despite their overboosted   less precise steering   the in comparison feels technically superior but distant another downside the large fords share   a faintly jiggly ride over minor pavement imperfections    taut   has a price   granted   i drove the f   in fx form   which includes a stiff   off road ready suspension   but the expedition feels much the same   and the current explorer does as well   so i suspect this jiggle is inherent in s suspension philosophy   throwing some mass in the back might help   i ve long noted in   consumer reports   that   unlike most cars   s cars often ride better when heavily loaded   if this is true for the cars   it must also be true for the trucks   which are designed to carry loads   in short   s suspension philosophy might include optimizing the ride with the vehicle heavily loaded noise of all forms is unexpectedly low in the new   this is the common finding from my test drive   refinement   refinement   refinement   did the blackwood come a generation too soon i did not evaluate off road performance   given that this was a test drive   i lack the skills at any rate   i would be surprised if the new fx did not perform well off the pavement   though   one nifty feature   the electronic throttle is more progressive in   low b safety   like the gm trucks but unlike the   four wheel anti lock brakes are standard   on the other hand   side airbags   of the curtain variety   are only available in the   traction control and stability control are not yet available on any of these four wheel drive trucks b reliability   first year designs from detroit brands are often troublesome   will the new f   prove unreliable   on the one hand   if could get any product right straight out of the box it would be this one   as they no doubt threw scads of their top talent at this truck   the engines and transmissions are also largely carryover   with the exception of the heavioy revised    liter v   eliminating a common source of problems    the v in my second year contour required replacement at    miles because of an issue known within but not admitted to by dealers   on the other   this was a very complex program   and recent first year fords   focus   escape   have been especially troublesome   i guess it all comes down to whether you are a betting man   if the truck does prove troublesome   i hope dealers know more about this product than the contour i recently disposed of   even in the detroit area i experienced much difficulty finding a dealer with a skilled and personable service department   i once asked a dozen owners if they knew of a good service department   and they all said no b pricing   as you might have noticed   i drove a truck with most of the available options   they add up   the sticker on my truck   which still lacked a few minor options   and the pricey flareside bed   read      go with the supercrew and check every box   and the sticker will easily top forty   edmunds suggests dealers will discount the truck i drove to      currently no rebate is available   though low interest financing is since many features on this truck are not even available on the competition   to get a sense of relative pricing it is better to look at an supercab xlt wd with the    liter engine   automatic   electronic wd   limited slip differential   rear defroster   power driver s seat   alloy wheels   and towing package   i expect this will be a popular combination   this truck would list for      and     after the typical discount    note   doing without four wheel drive would cut the price by over     a similarly equipped silverado ls extended cab with    liter v lists for     with a heavily discounted   light duty power package    i suspect this package is intended to counteract s new truck   after the typical discount and a     rebate   the cost drops to about      a similarly equipped    a href content   ram a b    quad cab with    liter v lists for      the typical discount and a     rebate take this down to about      so about dead even with the the is the oldest truck here   and gm has priced it to compensate   the other two are     more   quite a difference   i see lower transaction prices from and in the future   but in the case of the former perhaps only after it stops selling the old f   in    until then   the old truck can be used to keep price sensitive buyers from defecting to gm i update i   i ran the above numbers assuming that the s electronic four wheel drive system   optional on xlt   standard on wd fx and lariat   is a ful time system   as the salesman claimed as much   but i see no such claim in the brochure   and   consumer guide   states that offers only a part time system in the f    if so   then i have overstated the price of the and by about     the new just seems pricier and pricier b last words   the new f   impresses with its style   fit and finish   and all around refinement   i can not recall ever finding a standard full size pickup so appealing   the truck s major weakness is too much poundage even for its new   stronger engine   overall   the new pickup shows what can do when it pours talent and money into the development of a vehicle   but can the new f   recoup its large investment and relatively high manufacturing costs   can it bring good times back to dearborn   that remains to be seen   the and especially the seem very trucky after a drive in the   but the new is priced far above the   and i m unsure how many people will be willing to pay the premium   a few months will tell  
717,1,  intro trucks   you either love them or you hate them   me   i love them   trucks in england are extremely rare   if you did own one it would be almost impossible to afford to run one   i wanted a truck so bad   when i moved to oklahoma   i could not believe the amount of people who owned trucks   the one way for me to fit in   for me to become americanized would be to buy a truck   and i love the f   from dealership to dealership with so many dealerships and so many different types of trucks out there   my wife and i set out early   i knew i wanted a   i m a man   always have been always will be   you always know what you are going to get with fords   reliable   dependable transportation at reasonable prices   i started out looking at used trucks   i found a   xl model for     and was really tempted to buy it   but i wanted to look around at one more dealership   so we went to hudiburg   there was a beautiful red pickup right by the entrance to the show room   the salesman told me it was a    i told him i could not afford it   and then he told me the price       after i picked my jaw up off the floor and put my eyes back in their sockets i was ready to take the beast for a test drive   he told me that it was the special oklahoma texas package that made it so cheap   it is just a basic f   xl but oh boy do i love it first impressions if you have read any of my other reviews on automobiles you will know that i am quite particular on what i like   i like my vehicles to be curvy   i have no idea why   this was a big deciding factor in what truck i wanted to buy   the f   looks beautiful   sleek curves and lots of chrome and a re designed grill for    the xl comes with chrome wheels as standard and they look pretty sharp   the f   is very easy on the eye a pure joy to look at the interior of the truck is basic but everything you need is there   the xl is the low end model of the f   so there are no extras   what you see is what you get   the dashboard is once again like the exterior very curvy and real appealing it is nice to look at and is not harsh on the eyes   the layout is simple and looks clean and tidy   on the xl there is no rev counter   just the speedo   oil gauge temperature gauge and fuel gauge   the mileage counter is digital   which is pretty standard nowadays in most vehicles   the dials are big and are very easy to read and in classic style they light up green at night the stereo and the a c and heat controls are within good reach of the driver and they are very easy to operate though i think the stereo could be better   i also wish that would stop fitting double din stereos in their vehicles   that just adds extra cost when you want to replace the stereo   which i have just done   the a c and the heater work very very well   it gets cool very quickly in the truck   which is what you really need here in oklahoma   and the truck gets nice and warm quickly too my truck comes with a bench seat   which is actually pretty comfortable   and gives a reasonable amount of support   it folds forward so you can put a few small items behind the seat   i have a complaint about the material used on the seats though   it really isn t very good   i would have thought that being a truck the fabric would have been a bit tougher but it is not   about   months after buying the truck the stitching begun undoing and holes started appearing   and that is just through normal use   so i have now brought seat covers to stop further damage to the fabric   the steering column is not adjustable and the bench seat only moves back and forward and the back really doesn t move very much so you are always sitting in an upright position on the open road the f   i have is the    v   with standard transmission   the engine puts out bhp and is plenty powerful for everyday use   correct me if i am wrong but i think the    v is only   bhp less than the    v   the truck is quick   not lightning quick but there is ample power there   over taking on the interstate is not a problem   nor is having little fun at the lights    the truck does about   mpg on the interstate and about   mpg around town   which is pretty good   it costs me about     to fill the tank from scratch   the interior noise is pretty high   but compared to earlier model f   s it has improved greatly   the truck handles pretty well and it comes with power steering as standard   which always makes life easier   another thing that really surprises me with the truck is that there is very little roll when you turn into corners   more so than if you were in a car but still impressive   the ride quality is very good   you get the usual bouncy ride that you get from most trucks but overall the ride comfort is very good   my only other niggle is that the truck is rear wheel drive   i understand why that is but when there is nothing in the bed of the truck the back wheels tend to spin very easily so you have to take great car when driving this vehicle   the wheels spin if there is loose gravel on the road and it can be pretty bad when it has rained   so you just have to be that extra bit careful there is plenty of room in the bed of the truck for whatever you want to put in there and man does having a truck come in handy   we just moved into our first house and i do not know what we would have done without the truck   you can fit tons of things into the bed   it comes in very handy overall this truck is great   i love it   for     i can not complain to much   it is a basic model truck that will do you proud and will probably last you a life time  
718,1,  on a tight budget after first getting married   my wife and i bought a brand new   escort wagon for      it came with a c   dual powered remote mirrors   manual transmission   roof rack and a cassette stereo seven years and    miles later the car is still running great   it hasn t been   quot perfect quot   but what has gone wrong have been minor annoyances   see list at bottom of this epinion the car has lots of room for cargo   and the roll over cargo cover is great when you want to shade frozen groceries or just keep a passer by from looking into your car   the    split folding seats are life savers when taking trips to home depot controls throughout the car are too small   small radio buttons   with completely un intuitive radio clock settings   small fuel filler release lever   small climate control levers   admittedly it is a small car   but i ve driven a saturn and the controls were far larger one big problem were the original tires   after    miles the car started handling very poorly and i noticed the tires were wearing in an odd fashion   a mechanic thought the suspension was shot based on the wear of the tires   but a friend of ours said a good pair of tires fixed her problem   sure enough   a pair of goodyear weatherhandlers and     miles later we have not had a recurrence of the problem the wipers have only one intermittent setting   it lasts for about five seconds between wipes and it is a feature seldom used unless the rain is coming down at just the right rate   an annoying engineering problem is the windshield wipers are different sizes   after sizing up just one of the wipers i went to the store and bought a package of wipers   they always come in two s   i had to go back to the store after realizing the second wiper was a different size   but at least the next time i need wipers i ll have a complete set gas mileage has been excellent   averaging about   mpg   the gas tank is only   gallons   so expect about   miles between fill ups two child seats fit in the back seat   but only the smallest of children could fit between the two child seats   essentially making this a four seater until the children get bigger ride comfort is acceptable for short trips and bearable for long trips   road noise is pervasive at high speeds and handling is fair   the interior is very spartan in appearance and the vinyl and plastic look cheap   compared to other cars in its class    saturn   civic   cavalier   corolla   it s on par to conclude this is not the most comfortable car   heads will not turn when you drive it   it s had some problems   but   and this is a big but   it s never broken down   it holds lots of cargo   only cost     new   and has a current kelley blue book trade in value of       what s not to love about this car what s gone wrong    related    cost   plastic cap holder on windshield washer fluid broke   never fixed   plastic driver seat belt holder broke    part   did work myself   rubber insulator around rear passenger door    part   did work myself   broken rear suspension spring      including labor br br  
719,1,  i had a   escort wagon   i owned this vehicle longer than any other vehicle before or since   i really liked this car   believe it or not i was one of those people who swore that i would never own a station wagon   then my first child came and the extra room just made sense   we could throw the stroller   diaper bag   portable playpen crib all in the back of the escort for a trip to grandma s house   this car was really nice to drive   the seats are comfortable   it handles well on the road   even in the snow   this car would normally be fairly inexpensive   it that were true in my case i would probably still have this car   unfortunately i made some bad choices and ended up with a lot of negative equity   this car ended up with the brunt of the inequity and an extremely high interest rate to go with it   so as much as i loved this car   i hated the price i had to pay for it   i was lucky enough to find a car dealership that would help me rectify this situation and gave me a great deal on my last   vehicles    if you live in western washington check out automotive alternatives in bremerton   they were great   i really liked this car   i can t think of anything bad about it   no costly repairs   no breakdowns   just routine service br br  
720,1,  ok   it s not new anymore   the brake pedal looks worn and the new car smell is long gone   but i still love my escort wagon   i bought my wagon brand new in    it s been afforded all the basic upkeep required   i e   regular oil changes   the ocassional trip to the car wash   etc   now    miles later   i still can t bring myself to part with it   even today it is my main source of transportation oh   i haven t babied it any   this tough little tiger has seen seven unfriendly montana winters and faithfully carried me over small   back country   wooded   one lane   gravel roads   it almost single handedly served as a moving van for my family several times and has served to push another of our lesser vehicles to a safe parking place when the other vehicle failed me   i am absolutely amazed at how my escort wagon performs for me my fuel economy is favorable and manuerablity is faithful   i m not ready to go shopping for a new vehicle just yet   but one day when my little station wagon has reached the limits of it s usefulness   there is no question that i ll be back on the lot   looking to bring home the next generation br br  
721,1,  my wife and i currently own a   escort lx e   door hatchback and never cease to be amazed by its economic upkeep   reliability   and capabilities we live in south texas and use the car for local travel only    the best use of its service   we usually travel limited access highways and the escort keeps up with the bmws   mercedes   and   wheelers reasonably well   although the power we have is   obviously lower   our   quot little car quot   does   to   mph without breathing too heavily   and   best yet   unlike these other vehicles   the escort only requires an oil change   cost about     about every   miles and a major service   costing about     every    miles   how do you like that bmw and mercedes fans my wife is a real do it yourselfer who likes wood working   by using the hatch back feature   we have been able to haul   at different times   of course   a table saw   a treadmill walking machine   a router and router table   several sheets of plywood and over   xs the october   nada values on this car make it a great buy if you can find one in good condition   trade in      loan      retail     a really good price on this vehicle in good   not perfect   condition would be about     and a good price would be about      anything above retail is a rip off br br  
722,1,  a few months ago my wife and i went car shopping   we went looking for a tracker   a really good car when we have a car seat   and a   year old lol   well that day we test drove about   cars   just as we thought our search was going no where i saw the escort sitting right by the tracker we tried st   we test drove the car and loved the way it drove   a lot better car for a growing family than a tracker   i have to say i never saw me owning a station wagon   but i will not trade it in now   being an escort the gas mileage is great   we get about   mile to the gallon and with todays prices you can not beat that the one thing i worried about was the leg room   being    quot   it is hard to find a good car with leg room   to my surprise the wagon is very roomy   well as long as no one has to sit behind me   so i have to say i really do like my new car   even though it is an    does this mean i am getting old   lol   
723,1,  first off   let me state that i do not own this   f wd xlt supercab pickup that i am about to review   my best friend owns this truck   i borrowed it from him recently on a   mile round trip to pick up an item i bought out of state   some of you are probably asking yourselves   how can he write up a review on a vehicle that he doesn t even own   let me add though   that my job provides me the opportunity to drive a lot of different makes of light duty trucks     ton     ton   and   tons   these trucks are work trucks   i do not baby them   i use them   with that said   here is my opinion of the   f this particular is a teal colored   yuck   short box with    miles on the odometer   it is fitted with the optional    liter    c u   v   mated to an automatic overdrive transmission   this engine provided very adequate power   i set the cruise at   mph and the truck held it   even going up steep inclines that brought tractor trailers and vw buses to a crawl   the automatic transmission seemed to be very smooth and precise during shifting   with the cruise control set at   mph   the tach read a very respectable   rpm   i was very impressed with this since engine life would probably be extended with such a low engine rpm   i have no complaints whatsoever with the engine and tranny in this   i would recommend this engine over the smaller    liter    c u   v   especially if you plan on pulling a trailer of any size   also   i checked the mileage on my   mile journey   all interstate driving   i got    mpg   i would say this is par with other makes of    tons in the   model year   not as good as our   chevy    ton x    c u   i use at work   i can squeeze   mpg out of her   this contained two gas tanks to minimize gas station stops   a nice plus i thought the ride quality of this    ton was quite harsh compared to other makes of    ton trucks i have driven   i could feel every crack and bump i traversed on the interstate   i could even feel the vibrations through the steering wheel   i couldn t blame the poor ride on bad shocks   since i know my buddy just replaced the shocks   maybe the poor ride quality could be contributed partially to the type of tires he is running   i don t know   secondly   i thought there was more road noise entering the cab then was acceptable   thirdly   i found this truck   quot wanders quot   when this truck would wander into a rut on the interstate   it would pull suddenly to one side than the other   if one wasn t holding onto the steering wheel with both hands it could take you by surprise   i don t know what caused this   tires suspension   this model was equipped with a    split seat in front   i found the seats to be fairly comfortable   the driver was treated to a power lumbar support   in the center of the seat there was a fold down console   this was very nice   it contained   cup holders able to accommodate my rather large coffee mug   the console also had compartments inside for currency   notebooks   cell phones   etc   i am    quot   and found legroom to be acceptable   rear passenger legroom is limited though   as is with any extended cab pickup   the small fold down back seat is designed for small children   not adults i did not care for the stock sound system   it was an am fm stereo cassette w   four speakers   sound quality was very poor and could not drown out the excessive road noise that this exhibited   the buttons were extremely small making it very easy to hit the wrong button   also   the stereo was placed in a very awkward position in the dash   i had to reach very far toward the center of dash to turn channels   this could prove to be very hazardous when driving   first thing i would do if this was my vehicle is upgrade the stereo with an after market system   i had the opportunity to use both the air conditioning and the heater on my short    day trip   got ta love wyoming   i found both worked fantastic   no complaints in this department this truck was equipped with the power window door package   i found the power windows locks to be very efficient   the windows rolled up and down very fast   i own a   k blazer and my power windows are pathetically slow   so   this was a welcome change in terms of safety features   this truck contained rear anti lock brakes   don t quite understand the reasoning here   and a driver side airbag   a passenger side airbag was non existent   in terms of reliability of this truck   my friend has had darn good luck thus far   like i mentioned above   the truck now has    miles on the clock   he has had some problems with keeping the truck aligned   might be linked to the   quot wandering quot   problem   and front wheel bearings going out   i believe that is the only problems he has had in the four years he has owned the truck   i personally like the styling of this   f better than the new styling of the f s   but   if it was my choice i would choose the   chevy    ton over this     
724,1,  i chose this vehicle for several reasons   mainly the ability to comfortably carry a family of four   haul lots of stuff and tow   it is used to carry construction supplies and debris   take the family and accompanying baggage toys camping or traveling and tow various things   boats   trailers   etc   it does all of these things very well i bought the eddie bauer version   wd   l   auto trans   towing package   my commute is comfortable   even during long drives to new england all the family has adequate room   the size of the truck gives a good ride the truck weighs about    with fuel driver   i ve crossed the scales at the landfill weighing    on one occasion   pulling a trailer load of asphalt to be recycled   the combined weight was over     okay maybe i ve overloaded once in awhile the truck now has    miles on it   oil is changed regularly   tires rotated every    k miles   i ve had no problems with it   the original tires weren t replaced until    miles   still the original brakes with      wear left   good for another    miles or so   fuel mileage is around mpg   which i consider reasonable for the way i drive   two fuel tanks are a nice thing to have if this truck ever becomes a repair problem    k miles   i will definitely purchase another   probably a bigger one if you want a vehicle that does many things well and reliably   this is it if you want something to zip around the city in   you may consider something else   although there is the intimidation factor     
725,1,  i bought a new due to the history i have with the   i have owned   pickups and all have lasted past    miles   with understandable maintenance i recommend this pickup for everyone who truly needs a pickup   in the first   months of work   this pickup has truly proven it s self   in my line of work   i go places and sometimes carry more weight than most people would even try   believe me or not i feel this pickup could go anywhere a army jeep can   strait from the factory   the gas mileage is decent     with the   v    better than i expected   and that does not seem to change much when hauling heavy loads   lbs   the engine performance is ok   given it is such a small   i would love to have the old   v   in every pickup ever built   the ground clearance is larger than in pervious models   this pickup also has several in cab dodads that i like   such as more comfortable seats   additional compartments   outdoor temperature indicator   and easy adjustments to it all it was difficult to find a pickup with all of my specifications that i needed and had to special order this one   i do recommend the following   hand crank windows for longevity of use    speed manual trans   for better mpg   less engine strain in mud and towing   and emergency push starting i do not like the new body style   although it is growing on me   the lack of front fenders with this body style allows a steady rain of mud   amp   gunk to fall on the overly large front windshield when   wheel drive is needed   i also do not like the car like interior set up   although the cab is roomy   this set up wastes space and is hard to clean   another downside of this pickup is that   unless you are a mechanic   you can not fix any major problems that may arise yourself   just open the hood for yourself br br  
726,1,  this review is written in memory of our late friend and fellow epinionater   mike lambert   roadiem okay   let me be straight up front about this   yes i am australian   and no   the cars driven in the usa are not the same as here in australia but there are strong similarities   the main australian designed and built cars are little different from those used in the usa   so   how do i know well   about   months ago i had to spend a week in the u s   and i sought to rent as similar a vehicle as possible to that that i drive and own here in australia   the perfect vehicle for the role was the crown victoria   even though the name conjures up the queen   yuk   or a famous australian beer   since i drove one    miles around the u s   east coast   without hitting one kangaroo   i feel qualified to report on it s virtues   and   try as i did   i found it impossible not to make some comparisons with aussi cars    well sufferin snakes   i tried apart from getting in on the right hand side incessantly   i found this vehicle to be near identical to my aussi futura   that brings me to the only real fault in this car   and all usa cars    that being there is no warning to get in the left hand side if you want to drive it    its so damn embarrassing   jumping in the right side for a quick take off with nothing there now seriously   to me and i suspect most people   a car is either working or its broken   so you won t be bored here with a whole lot of mechanical jargon however   i do know enough to realize the crown does follow the near universal basics of medium and big cars   that is rear wheel drive and a penchant for effortless highway cruising while still being quite maneuverable enough for the rigors of big city traffic for the average motorist its obvious that these basics are still the preferred vehicle type   despite the plethora of mostly japanese and korean buzz boxes on offer in both countries perhaps this is because both australia and the usa are relatively large with long distance driving common   things have changed a bit though   with us cars no longer having football field size trunks and engine bays big enough for a spare engine   resulting in much more compact designs compared to those of say twenty years ago fuel consumption is no doubt the major reason   here   by us standards   the crown does quite well but there is substantial room for improvement since equal australian cars do about twenty percent better   perhaps the slightly cheaper fuel   due to differing taxation   makes the difference while the crown victoria i rented drove extremely well   i was surprised to learn it still had the old solid axle type rear suspension instead of the newer independent rear suspension or irs   however   the two most important safety features   being abs and power torque control were standard   as would be expected   the debatable air bags that have swept the world are of course standard    they ll have the damn things on pushbikes next i noticed crown victoria s everywhere   so they must be high in the sales stakes   and surely that alone speaks for itself   i understand they are even the vehicle of choice of many if not most government agencies   including the police this too speaks volumes for its usability and quality so that s what an alien thinks of the crown victoria    in a nutshell this vehicle would hold its head high in any as a practical   well priced family car with outstanding touring capabilities mixed with good city driving attributes i found it both easy and enjoyable to drive   the ultimate test of any vehicle   and i have no doubt it would be at the top of my list if i was a usa citizen b the proceeds of this write off go to mikes wife   in his memory   may he rest in peace b b this review is a joint effort between smithswoodside and ladycynic whose personal generosity in this regard makes me cringe in disbelief    please also visit ladycynic s site    please read the other write off entrants listed below bjcuevas   napthalia   seether   sherrylee   mattjoe   viper   gollygumdrops   noniabidnis nightshade    obnox   hawkseafan   yyvonne diverpam   t hall   mtuairau   jennifa   pperky hnnygrlca   rcknron   midoyle   charlesnep   lattechick   garfield   bgoodday   chrisceb   alwaysstubborn nwinston   hirohito   sweetcece   theworm ginahill   jpmcgurk   tiffer   juliette   elorraine   imames   pipet   sparkospunky   disartain   linda lisa j   lgcurcio yahoo   kristinafh   tgreenway   pambo   friskycelery   tjarnold   iculooking   todd   teddiec darby walters wolfman   emeleel   joubert   technologyrep gamblinfamily
727,1,  this was one of the best cars i have ever owned the gas milage is nt too bad   i feel very secure driving this car i feel like i could pickup and go to florida if i felt like it   i would highly recomend this car to anyone   i know that alot of people say it s huge but when you are behind the wheel it dosen t feel that big   so if you are looking for a good reliable and inexpensive used car and size does nt matter try it out i thin you ll like it also if you can find one with a premium sound system you certainly will not be disapointed br br  
728,1,  in normal everyday life   i drive a volvo s   while working   i drive my crown victoria   this is a very nice car and i have had it since new   it is very comfortable   and i love the color it s dark green a k a    quot willow quot   i was given this car for work as my buick park avenue ultra was totalled   i liked the park avenue because the dashboard doubled as a m amp m dispenser on long trips   the crown vic is great for prolonged surveillance operations the gas mileage is poor and the power is lackluster   however   i convinced my employer to designate funds to make a couple of changes   a   chamber flowmaster dual exhaust was installed   very quiet   underdrive pulleys   hypertech chip and a k amp n air filter   these have made a remarkable improvement and has deleted the   mph engine cutoff   i got the   model   which has the updated transmission and new interior   that like of a   model   very good ergonomics there were a few problems with the car that are typical with any    crown vic   the tranny needed to be tuned up at k miles     at k   the   quot check engine quot   light illuminated   which    of the time indicates that your egr passage in the intake manifold is carboned up     and at the same time   the horn button discentigrated     new tires at k and front brakes at k   all prices were at the dealership out of warranty   parts   amp   labor   no problems during warranty this vehicle is nearing    miles and will be decomissioned at k   i hope to god that i will get another one who should buy this   if you have a big family   i have had   people in this car once   live in your car   or travel a lot for work this is the car   amazingly   it is very easy to park   it has been shot at three times and all three bullets missed so   it is not as big as it looks   if you love rear drive performance at a good price   look no further   my next car    crown victoria br br  
729,1,  lets put it this way my grand mother drives this car   it is rahter big and some what comfortable in the interior   but it has horrible gas mileage and is quite ugly   if your are under   years of age and want to hold up any kind of an image this car might not be a good idea   it handles turns pretty well but the acceleration isn t that great and it is a real pain to park because it is so wide and long   however it is dependable   so if that is what you are looking for this is a good car br br  
730,1,  the birth of our third child obliged us to sell our   liter in   and buy a new crown vic after test driving every full size car on the market   the car just turned    miles   and it still seems brand new   the car is boilerplate reliable   the biggest repair has been a power window replacement   the car s only weak point is its oil consumption   about   quart per   miles   for its size   the vic handles well   has plenty of power   is comfortable and quiet   the trunk is huge   i keep a notebook in the car   and it shows that we get   mpg on the highway   year in   amp   year out   because we recently adopted two more kids   we bought a new chevy venture minivan   but my wife continues to use the vic as regular transportation to work   shopping etc   we plan to keep the vic as long as it makes economic sense to do so   and as long as it remains such a pleasure to drive   if all goes well   when our   year old turns   he can drive it   and take himself   amp   the other   to school   the crown vic is a keeper i sold this car may      we weren t using it enough to justify keeping it   the book value was about     but because it still drove so well and looked so new   i sold it for    to the first person who came to see it   he thought the car was a bargain at that price     
731,1,  i have wanted this car since they changed the body style all those years ago   i couldn t afford it the last time i bought a new car   but this year i could i m not a mechanic   i m not a car buff   i don t choose a car because of the engine   i m a teacher   i want a car that looks good   rides well   and is dependable   i chose the crown victoria   and it has been all of those   it also has a trunk that holds all of my sister in law s luggage with room for that of her husband and son   too   an amazing feat all by itself i have owned the car for   months   and have had no mechanical problems with it   it gets good gas mileage for a big   should i say huge   car   i live in ohio   where winters are sometimes severe   i needed the traction control only a couple of times during the winter   always to climb a steep driveway   the traction control gives back what rear wheel drive takes away   the anti lock brakes have also kicked in a couple of times   the first time it startled me felt like i hit something on the road the car is very comfortable   my son and i agree that we could   go camping   in this car no tent required   the front split bench seat is pretty comfortable to   make out   in too   take my word for it or try it yourself   grin however   the car is not perfect   the problems are in the fit and finish   there is a wind sound from the front passenger door   the right windshield wiper is never quite hidden   there is a whistle from the driver door   there are several imperfections in the paint   in one place the edge of the windshield shows instead of being protected by the molding   in several places tolerances are unacceptable   none of these things affect performance   but they are annoying  
732,1,  supercab   super the supercab    general description the pick up is manufactured at the factory in edison   new jersey   it is one of the most popular pick up in its category   it comes in a large variety of models and it is the least expensive of all the other pick ups amongst the competitors within the same category offers their customers a choice of three engines   an economical   cylinder   a   liters v and a more powerful   liters v   as for transmissions again s will give you three options   a manual   speeds   an automatic for the l and a different automatic for the l engine the inside    outside the interior the interior of the i drove was well finished and the materials seemed to be of good quality   there were no fancy rug on the floor   an example is that the flooring was made of an easy to clean and maintain rubber mat   the controls are easy to access and there is a complete set of gauges that are also easy to read   one thing i noticed about the gauges is their simplicity   by this i mean that if a person while driving surpasses the normal zones on a gauge there is no red zone on that gauge to indicate that the driver is in a dangerous situation the cabin was tight and i did feel that the interior was closing on me   there seem to be very little elbowroom   maybe i would have felt differently if i had driven the standard model the exterior the paint job on the truck was excellent and the panels seemed to fit tightly   it was equipped with a plastic fuel tank   which will prevent rust   but the inside of the rear box and the fenders seemed to have very little protection against bumps and scratches   it would be a good idea to have a liner install when purchasing a new pickup i really liked the way the exterior looked   every thing seems to be in the right proportions and well built the road test the model i drove was the supercab   it was equipped with a v l and an automatic transmission i found that there was a lot more noise than expected for a new truck   but after all it is a truck and because of the stiff rear suspension i felt the drive to be a bit bumpy   probably it would offer a smother ride once there is a load in the rear box breaking seemed satisfactory on a dry pavement but harder to control on a wet pavement technical information the truck i drove was as follows engine   v   l transmission   automatic drive    wheel drive brakes   front discs   rear drum   anti lock system on the rear wheels tires   p r truck weight     lbs cargo weight capacity     lbs towing capacity     lbs personal experience i feel this is a better than average pickup truck   i felt a little cramped in the driver seat and the ride was a little rough   i think that although this truck looks good it is truly a work truck i would not drive this vehicle on a long trip and i believe it is also limited for off roaming   but if someone needs a truck to transport tools and equipment to a working place this is the one of choice  
733,1,  as the proud owner of my fourth explorer   i can honestly say the    explorer   is absolutely the best model yet   proudly touts the   as being all new   in fact   there are significant differences in the   that made my   model seem practically obsolete    new body style   the most noticeable difference is the new body style   it s quite a bit larger than previous model   with several enhancements the wheelbase is   inches long and almost     inches wider   with a more rigid suspension and better insulation   it also provides a noticeably quieter ride the independent rear wheel suspension really helps provide a smoother   more comfortable ride and   yes   it looks different   it s definitely bigger and the door handles are completely different   the rear window door has been changed   it definitely looks different than previous models    there s a practical reason for this that makes it easier to pop open the window and have almost full access to the cargo area b more room   yes   there really is more room inside the   explorer   i can easily tell the difference in how much room there is between the front bucket seats   this allows a   wider console   that easily provides two cups holders   a handy storage tray and a roomy storage compartment with latched top   there is also an outlet for charging my cell phone in the top of the console   this console is very convenient and ergonomically arranged there is a tissue holder inside the top of the console   i like this better than the previous models where the tissue was accessible from the outside of the console   there was always a ton of tissue fuzz to deal with the hard part about this is finding the travel size kleenex boxes that fit here   target has been my best source to find these junior size boxes my husband loves the   extra head room   it provides   he is very tall and often found his head bumping the top of our   explorer   he has head room to spare in the   model we purchased the optional   rd row fold down seat    so eight people can comfortably ride inside   the second row seat folds down in three pieces   giving you six different configurations to aid in hauling cargo b lots of extras    the   cd player   holds   cds and is located in the dash   the dash itself seems lower and wider and it s easier to see out      dual climate control   allows the driver and front passenger to choose their own temperature settings   you can also set it to display the   outside air temperature    there are   redundant controls   on the steering wheel for the sound system and climate control   and of course   there is also cruise control   the   tilt steering wheel   is also height adjustable     the   electronic monitoring display   tells you just about everything you need to know about your car   miles to empty   miles per gallon   fuel level   oil level   wiper fluid level     the    home link b   option lets you pre program up to three codes   no more worrying about keeping up with a garage door or gate opener   i did notice you have to hold down the button a little longer than expected to get it to open the garage door   the   electric memory driver seat   allows both my husband and i to set the seat positions we prefer   then when we open the doors with our controller everything is set for us    it s so nice not to constantly readjust the settings between drivers    heated rear view mirrors   come on automatically when you turn on the rear defroster   the front   seats are electric and adjustable   in a variety of ways   and   yes   they re also   heated    i never thought i would enjoy a   bun warmer   but it will be nice in the dead of winter when those leather seats get cold from being in the parking lot all day at work b and let s not forget the middle seat b   there are   air vents   and   separate temperature controls    as well   even with two baby seats   there is still   plenty of room   for an adult to ride in comfort there are also   additional air vents   in the very back for the comfort of any passengers who might be riding in the third row seat b easier trunk access   is provided by allowing the glass to open lower   making it easy to get groceries or suitcases in and out   the rear seat folds down almost completely flat   allowing     cu   ft   of storage space   even the fuel tank is larger   holding    gallons of gasoline    improved performance   we purchased the optional    l triton v   engine    with   hp and   lb ft of torque   i ve had to be careful not to drive too fast    no   i do   not   have a lead foot i it really offers a   smoother   quieter ride   and handles very well   i just thought my previous explorer drove like a car   this baby is very responsive and handles like a luxury automobile b eddie bauer version vs   limited   my   explorer was a limited and we had planned to purchase a   limited   but they were in short supply   after looking closely and comparing features   the primary difference in the two was that the limited offered certain colors that the eddie bauer did not   the limited also lets you have monotone leather seats instead of the two tone bauer leather seats all the other luxury extras   especially home link   are now included in the eddie bauer   i don t feel that i am missing anything from the luxury or the extras that i had in my previous limited b we love it   my husband and i have owned this car for three months now and we love it   it s extremely comfortable and it is a great looking vehicle it s averaging about   mpg in the city so far and we got it up to   on the highway   it s still breaking in and the mileage seems to be steadily improving we recently took a day trip in which we spent about six hours in this vehicle   we kept commenting how much we enjoyed the extra room and the smoother ride   my husband definitely enjoyed the extra head room we have the   eddie bauer   model with leather two tone seats   i wasn t too crazy about the two tone look at first   but i m liking it better all the time   i ve gotten several compliments on the interior   so that doesn t hurt either b provided extras   offered several incentives to buy       owner loyalty rebate      financing   for   months    look   ma   no finance charges i   a nice   tote bag   was given to us just for taking a test drive   we received a   tailgate party kit   for purchasing    this included a canopy   grill   and cooking utensils    we received our gifts last week after mailing in the postage paid cards provided   later we received a    gift certificate from eddie bauer   nice for christmas shopping b highly recommended   i can t think of a better time to buy than now    great interest rates   extra incentives   and a really comfortable   good looking suv   i really love this great explorer  
734,1,  i recently traded an amazing    mile honda accord for a brand new explorer   the main reason being that i need more space   space is what you get with the explorer   the rd row option opens up this vehicle to a much larger market   most suvs seat   people the extra seat boosts that number to    the durango and the tahoe went under close scrutiny before i decided on the this redesigned truck is great   there is new independent rear suspension   a new shock strut system   a new exhaust fuel tank layout   and a new footprint   this explorer is a bit longer   a bit wider   and even has a bit more ground clearance all while being a little bit shorter   this suv feels solid and comfortable while driving   there are several small details that add to this truck as well   the running boards and doors are designed to keep dirt off of the lower door seal keeping you and your kids clean while entering and exiting   the rear window s bottom seal dips down farther than before making it lower and thus easier to load and unload without opening the door   automatic headlamps are nice and the doorlock switch mounted near the back door is handy   i have been extremely impressed with my new vehicle   it was a big step to move from a   door honda to an american suv   i have not been disappointed yet  
735,1,  i recently had the opportunity to purchase a   explorer   door as my main vehicle   i have since driven it for    miles   changed the oil three times   and really have not had any problems with it   the vehicle has a little over    miles on it   and i am still getting the rated   highway     city mileage   and sometimes better   but never worse my explorer is a   speed   with is a very dependable piece of equipment   coupled to the   l v    it has enough power to do what i want to do with it   it has the room a college student needs to move in and out every year   and haul people during the year   it is economical enough to be a daily driver   dependable enough that it really has not seen the shop under my possesion   and small enough that parking it is not compared to parking the more mammoth of suvs the only time it has seens the shop is when i had to have a synchronizer   st    nd shift   replaced   point of note   do nt believe your friend when he says he   thinks   he knows how to drive stick   my explorer does not have wd   but that has not stopped me from taking it offroad   coupled with my firestone wilderness atx s   i have taken mud   sand   and water   within reason   of course the interior on mine is vinyl   but the seats are very comfortable   the front seats are a high backed bucket   which makes long trips easier on your neck i have been pleasantly suprised by my explorer   and from how it is fairing   i will have it for a good time to come  
736,1,  i leased a    explorer sport   wd    years ago and have been very happy with it   i did a lot of research into suv s before picking the explorer   the toyota   runner seems   overall   a better vehicle   but it is underpowered and sluggish in comparison   even the v   very expensive   and does not come in the more economical   door sport version that the comes in   and the jeep cherokee   for the same money had none of the cool doo dads that came with the explorer i opted for the fully loaded vehicle   it is very comfortable   has a fantastic sound system   and its sohc engine has all the pickup i need   the compass temperature gauge rocks   and the tissue dispenser is indispensable   i have made several road trips with up to   people   and everyone was comfortable the entire time   also   it s really easy to fold the back seats down for extra cargo space   one of my favorite things about the truck is its turn radius   it has an awesome turn radius   none of the other trucks i test drove could make such incredibly tight turns   but it does have some problems   ever since i got the truck   the air bag warning light has been flashing erratically   sometimes it stays on   sometimes it flashes   and sometimes it doesn t come on at all   the air bag warning light does frighten me   but according to the user s manual   there is a warning beep that will sound along with the light when there s a real problem with the air bag   i have had the truck serviced by mechanics and another service shop as well   and neither garage could fix the problem   also   for the first year i had the truck   whenever i would use my turn signals   the windshield wipers would turn on   this was good for a laugh but not much else   this weird bug was fixed by mechanics   i would not recommend this wd vehicle for off roading   and it sucks in the snow   it handles dirt roads better than a sports car   but i wouldn t trust it in real hard core off road situations   then there is   of course   the tire recall i have very little confidence in the electrical system of the truck   which makes me glad i leased it instead of buying   my doubts as to whether or not i will lease another have more to do with s eagerness to sell people death traps than with how much i ve enjoyed driving my truck   they re losing so much money from the firestone recall though   they ll probably have to offer really good deals   i probably will lease another explorer sport   but i will not buy one   and i will make damn sure i m not being sold recalled tires   i wouldn t put it past them to try br br  
737,1,  my sister got a   explorer wd   door sport for her th birthday   it was a great suv to start off with   at first   everything was great and nothing went wrong   now from what we thought was a little problem we re ending up having a big problem   the first thing to go wrong was the back seat head rest   after it went up it didn t come back down   the dealership had to send it to an upholstery shop so they could take the seat apart to get the headrest back down and they still have not fixed   it takes them   days just to figure out they have to order a part for this seat and they still have not gotten the part in   next   the front passenger seat wouldn t slide up   well after that was fixed   we had the bomb dropped on us   the tires   she had firestone wilderness tires on her explorer and they ve been recalled   the tread is coming off and the tires are worthless   so to speak   the worst part is is that we are in the   phase of the recall so it will not be until next year that we can have her tires replaced   it had been bearable until we found this out   i do   however recommend the explorer   i just recommend that you check the serial number on the tires before you make your final decision   other than these few problems   the explorer has been a joy to drive br br  
738,1,  i bought a   gt convertible in late   with    miles on it   it looked great and seemed a great way to take advantage of the atlanta weather three years later   how do i feel   well   it s been a lot of fun and i m converted to convertibles   the itself has limitations   understandably given the price   the only design criterion is power as there are niggly issues elsewhere   such as if you use the cup holder   it is difficult to use the handbrake   and you need a handbrake because if you get this car you should be buying a manual transmission   why would anyone buy an automatic sports car as for other design quality issues   i had problems with the driver s seatbelt fraying   the lower guide was rough and gradually wore through the belt   also   the handbrake was misaligned within the center console   causing the rubber edging to the slot in the console to tear   the a c also failed and took   attempts for the dealer to fix   a piece of the roof came loose and had to be replaced the roof is pretty quick to put up or down   about   seconds   but requires a bit of manual effort to lock into place or unlock   especially compared with the toyota solara convertible i now own road noise is not bad for a convertible   albeit not as quiet as more expensive models i ve been in   the car is ok for reasonably long journeys   as long as you don t have to sit in the back there is tremendous acceleration if you get the revs right   if you don t   you get zero benefit from at least half the   l engine as escorts can give you a run for your money   and if it s wet   don t even think about using the accelerator   if you do anything more than contemplate putting your foot down   the rear end will be all over the place   even if going in a straight line   or trying to the handling is good when dry   and the ride us hard   as you would expect from a sporty car   if you live in a neighborhood with speed bumps   make sure you test drive going over them before buying the car i ve owned other fords and   like them   the gear shift and clutch operation is smooth   with a clear response to tell you you are in gear still   on a nice day   it s great to put the top down and hear the noise of the v   the top goes up and down pretty easily   it takes   seconds   the car looks even better with the rear cover   but that is so difficult to put on that i ve only used it twice there is a surprising amount of room in the trunk   the rear seats are very cramped for anyone bigger than a small child   i have a   year old that complains about lack of room   so i ll be trading it in soon fuel economy   no idea   i m english and the gas in georgia seems virtually free to me   compared with    gallon in the uk   so i never measured it   i believe that the official figures are low s if you want fun in a convertible   this is a fairly cheap way of achieving it   don t expect practicality or high design though   if you want that   pay    more and get a bmw     
739,1,  i had a   gt   i say had   because the car was leased   i turned the car in because    driving a   speed in chicago s traffic was driving me nuts     rear wheel drive during winter in chicago is a horrible experience   and    my wife just had a baby and we needed more space don t be mislead from the above statements   i loved this car   it had lots of power   it looked great   it took off from the starting line like a rocket ship   it took the corners like it was on rails   overall   the is just a fun car to drive   i must admit   however   that i was pleasantly surprised at the ride of this car   it was much smoother than previous models i had little to no problems with the car except for the front end alignment going out on me   what didn t i like   in   replaced the   l engine with the   l engine   the gas mileage isn t that great i have driven the chevy camaro   the pontiac firebird   and even the chevy corvette   i own a     and i would have to say that the is much more fun to drive than the camaro or the firebird   it not in the same league with the corvette   but it is the next best thing who should buy the car   only people without children who should not buy drive the car   parents who s   year old kid just got his driver s license     
740,1,  i bought this vehicle in february of    when it had first been released   the dealer had it before i did   and the car was in excellent condition with about   miles on it   fully loaded   i love this car   i was in the military for a while and it got me from texas to new jersey almost twice a year if not more   this is the best vehicle i have ever owned   it is fun   sporty and reliable   i get a smooth ride out of it every time i drive   no matter what the road conditions are like   if you like this type of   quot luxury quot   vehicle without the prices   i highly recommend it to anyone who loves to drive and look good br br  
741,1,  get an old tempo and stick to your beat    yes   we re talking music here    i have been and still am the proud owner of three tempos   a l   a   and a l   i am a woman who drives approximately   to   miles a day in all kinds of weather   i am a consistent driver   in that i keep relatively the same speed for the same length of time while commuting to and from work   these cars are easy to drive and easy to control   they are great in snow and icy conditions   they have a front wheel drive that s excellent without snow tires   and i live in northern new york state   near the canadian border   the gas mileage is great and at a steady pace of just below   miles and hour i use almost no gas at all   if you re a careful driver   mind the speed limit and don t peel out too often   i d sure recommend a tempo to you   there s just nothing about these low key cars i don t like   i ve been driving them for   years   blue book value should increase   in my opinion   br br  
742,1,   this opinion comes from a girl with no experience with trucks of any kind except maybe the toy trucks i buy my son   this is strictly a review on why i like it   not on anything under the hood i my boyfriend loves trucks   i had never driven a standard before   since we both use the vehicle i thought buying a truck wasn t a smart idea   he said i needed to learn   he earns the money   i was out voted we just bought our last week   it was only      definitely in our budget   i must say that i am pleased   the truck is great on gas which is a major plus with the gas prices rising and falling everyday   although   it isn t a full sized truck   it can carry a load a lot bigger than you would think it could   the cab isn t very roomy but it gives me and my boyfriend some   quot close quot   time lol i learned how to drive it in a day which surprised me because i m not very coordinated when it comes to doing more than one thing at a time   and no it s not because i m blonde   it was very easy to learn on   the truck is still in great running condition for being   years old and having over    miles on it   it s not too big either which is great for me so i don t try to run people over if they get in my way i was very pleased with our purchase and would recommend a for anyone in the market for a cheap   dependable little truck   it s a great one for us women drivers br br  
743,1,  i m in the market for a new car and have been test driving lots of vehicles lately   when one is a serious candidate   i also look around for one i can rent for a couple days to take on a business or family trip to get a better feel for how it works for me in a day to day situation b i most of the vehicles i ve been driving recently have been well equipped   door sedans in the      range   but a lot of my friends and neighbors have been buying big trucks   and i ve got to admit   there s a certain appeal to the truck   i ve had small toyota trucks before and i always liked having the open cargo area   which gave me the flexibility of buying big items on impulse or doing home improvement projects easily   no need for delivery   i can just load that topsoil into the back of my truck   thank you very much b i i m a firm believer in considering as many options as possible in order to really know what s best and to really get the best deal   comparing apples to oranges can be loads of fun when buying a car   a few days after driving the f    i went into a mercedes dealership to check out the c    the saleswoman asked what kinds of vehicles i was comparing to the mercedes   i rattled off the de rigueur competitors   like the bmw   and jaguar x type   then threw in   and a f crew cab   the look on the woman s face was priceless    we don t compete with pickups   she informed me with a sneer   i had to struggle to keep a straight face b i unfortunately for her   it is the   customer   who defines the competitive landscape    not   the salesman   and   definitely   not any suit wearing monkey from corporate marketing   she didn t understand that   and it s her loss because the c   was a good car and she   could   have gotten a sale if she was smart enough and quick enough to deal with a smart a s customer like me who happened to have been shopping with a checkbook in hand      i smack i    we don t give a poop   get back to talking about the oh yeah   right   this is a f   review   sorry about that   my impressions of this vehicle are based mostly on a   day weekend rental from thrifty car rental   yes   some locations   do   rent pickups    by the way   here in houston   budget seems to be a good place to rent if you like driving small pickups   i also test drove the king ranch version at a local dealer   but just as a   minute test drive    can t tell as much from that   but it s kind of fun to check out the fully loaded deal b i b exterior styling   fit and finish   and etc   too   i like the looks and styling of full size trucks   they aren t as boxy and square as they used to be   but they still look utilitarian enough to be taken seriously as trucks and not as glorified cars with a little cargo space tacked on   which is i how i view some new trucks   which i will identify only as explorer   nissan frontier   and avalanche      ground clearance is excellent   even with the two wheel drive versions   of course that means that short people are going to feel like they re forever climbing mt   everest just to get up into the thing   but that s the price you pay for driving one huge hulking chunk of dearborn steel   if somebody complains   tell the girly man to get a volkswagen b i i really like the   feel   of the f    everything feels thick   heavy   and substantial   one of the things i didn t care for when i drove a toyota tundra was the way things   clicked   when they should have   clunked     do you know what i mean   i expect doors on a full size truck to feel   heavy    a thin door feels okay on a little tacoma truck   but not okay on tundra   what i want on the tundra is a door that feels like the door on a f    it feels like a man s door   not like a little kid s door   ditto on the tailgate   ditto on the front hood   toyota makes a good   reliable truck   i m sure of it   but they don t make a full size truck that   feels   as good as a     or chevy full size truck b i i right bed for you i there s a bit of an on going debate over the   right   bed length for a full size truck   the problem is that with trucks like s f   super crew   the overall length isn t really increased over what you get with a standard or extended cab    s engineers simply stole the space for that back seat from the bed   the argument i always hear is   well   people don t carry stuff that requires a long bed      they don t   eh   well   maybe a typical family doesn t often want to carry huge bulky things   nor do the firefighters depicted in s oh so heartwarming commercials   but other people   do    yes   the short bed will do fine for carrying boxes   boots   maybe even some rolled up fire hoses   what it won t do fine at is carrying the kinds of things that most people in the construction trades want to carry b i think about it and think about what people who work for living typically want to carry   what length are most boards   sheet rock   pvc tubes   fence posts   conduit   ladders   right    feet to   feet   not   feet    at least not at the lowes i go to b i in my opinion   the bed is   too short   on the super crew    especially for anyone considering this vehicle as a work truck   yes   you   can   put the tailgate down   yes   you   can   use one of those extender racks to give yourself a little extra occasional space   but don t those only give you about   feet max      in my opinion   the tailgate and extender strategy is   not   quite as good as having a genuine   foot bed   which you can also drop the tailgate down on giving yourself   feet   some guys are   going   to want more space in the cargo area than you get on the typical super crew cab f       before you buy this truck   think about whether the bed length is a problem for you   if you are a typical suburban mom who just wants a snazzy looking beefy vehicle to drive around town   then hey   no biggee   go for it   but if you re working in the trades and thinking about using this vehicle   as a truck    then think long and hard about whether that bed is adequate   otherwise you ll be regretting the purchase for a very long time b i b interior comfort   features   and more etc   too   the big draw on this big truck is the interior space   you get a real live back seat   genuinely usable back doors   and enough space to seat   comfortably    if you have a bench style front seat   even on longer trips   no more scrunching or using the back seat of extended cab trucks as seating only for contortionists and short midgets b i this is really the perfect truck for families   i like the looks of the extended cab better than the super cab   but for practical value and overall utility and comfort   the super cab is tough to beat   because i m a dad   i always check out the back seat when i look at cars   i want easy access for moving car seats in and out and putting little people into their seats   i also prefer quite a bit of leg room   not so much to make things comfortable for adults   but so that little feet find it not so easy to kick the back of the drivers seat   hey   we all have different perspectives on these things b i most people are probably going to go for the xlt version of this truck because it offers everything that most people want today while at the same time   keeping the price somewhat reasonable   it s got a nicely appointed interior with automatic transmission   air conditioning   power windows and door locks   stereo with cd player   cruise control   captain style bucket seats with lumbar support and power adjustment on the driver side   and a console between the two front seats   as i said   a comfortable combination   also offers a lariat package   leather upholstery is the big plus there   and specialty versions called the king ranch version and the harley davidson version b i i king ranch package   the king ranch version that i drove at central had the highland green paint   which is a very deep forest green   together with the brown leather interior with the independent captains chairs in front   it was a sharp looking vehicle    no doubt about it      i wonder how well their   rugged   sales pitch is going to do   i sure didn t buy it   my opinion is that the king ranch version is not a very practical vehicle for rugged use   i d call this truck the   waltham soccer mom   edition   it s plushy   power everything   and too overloaded to be a real practical work truck   i could   never   see it really being used on a ranch   a construction site   nor anywhere else where rugged conditions prevail    hey   get your muddy boots off that plush pile carpet   you raised in a barn or sumpin   i laughed out loud when i saw the heated seats in the king ranch version   last i heard   the king ranch was about as far south as you can be and still be on u s   soil   do you know   where   the real king ranch is   i do because i drive through it fairly often   it s in south texas   only a couple dozen miles north of the mexican border   it s an area where palms grow and coastal farmers raise grapefruits and ranchers raise as many cactuses as steers   not exactly the kind of climate where heated seats might come in handy   yep   on those icy cold   degree winter days when the nor westers blow through you really wanna crank up the heated seats   sure   nuff   this is the truck for   real   texas cowboys   uh huh b i don t even get me started on s   harley davidson   package b power   performance   and yet more etc b the truck i drove had the   horsepower    liter triton v   engine   with that powerplant   the truck was very responsive   also offers a smaller    liter v   in the f s   but with only   horses at its beck and call   that seems too little for a truck as big and heavy as the f     especially if you plan to pull a trailer     horsepower is about what many family sedans have      according to   this truck can tow up to    pounds and has a payload capacity of    pounds   hmmm   i could even take my mother in law for a ride i was impressed with the handling of this truck   the advantage of shortening the bed and keeping the overall vehicle length about the same as with the extended and regular cabs is that the vehicle doesn t handle like a tank    the f   super cab has a   inch wheelbase   sure   it s not going to corner like a z would   but it turns tightly for its size and is easy to get used to   i don t see anyone having a problem handling this truck in normal suburban traffic b i the truck is equipped with power anti lock brakes and in normal driving conditions   the braking felt good   i don t recall trying a hard brake situation with this truck    sorry b i b general impressions   conclusions   and any remaining etc b official info on features   performance specs   pricing   etc   for these trucks is on the web at   fordvehicles trucks f   prices are a bit high on the f     the one i drove runs about     msrp    however   i have recently seen quite a few ads from dealers in the local area offering these trucks with the xlt package at prices around   k   i think   k is too much for this truck   and i wouldn t pay that price   but at the   k level   it becomes a a fair value and i might consider it seriously b i for my purposes   the f   represents a pretty good package for use as a family car   and i might come back to it if i can t find a better deal elsewhere   stay tuned for more info on the great car purchasing adventure of    til next time   see you in the showroom b i  
744,1,  the truck i purchased and am reviewing is a   f   supercrew with the   fx offroad   package new for   i love this truck   if you think about it   when was the last time you were able to pull over at a garage sale with you and three people loaded into your suv   buy that large enlongated oversized treasure you just had to have   and stuff it into the rear   only to have to drive home in icy conditions well   this hasn t happened to me yet here in southern california   but who knows the point is   when i first saw the supercrew a few years ago   i fell in love with the concept   i could still do somewhat oversized hauling   and at the same time fit one    two    three    four    five    or even six people into the cabin   and still have headroom   to me   the supercrew exceeds the practicality of   and in itself is a superior suv the short     bed is questionable for any type of tradesman   since i won t be using it as a work truck   it suits me very well   mine came with a   cargo cage    bed extender   and will haul my surfboards very handily   the model i purchased has the   l triton v   i find it to have more than enough power   it sounds like a big v during acceleration and quiets down nicely when up to speed and cruising   of course it also likes to drink its lions share of gasoline   i m not sure what the mileage is   but i don t think i ll expect anything better than   mpg on the highway   even with the    limited slip rear end it s equipped with an automatic transmission   and shift   on the fly   x transfer case   i can engage   wheel drive from the dash while driving less than   mph the fx offroad package upgrades the supercrew for individuals who like aggressive four wheeling   it includes skid plates beneath the transfer case   gas tank   and front axle assembly   they lifted the truck   tastefully   and stiffened the suspension with heavy duty shocks   it also includes   inch aluminum five spoke alloys   with goodyear at s lt    tires   they also throw in stainless steel lug nuts   to finish the fx package off   they include a red   fx offroad   decal   two tone paint   and a matching red decal stripe separating the two tones of paint   fmc must be trying to attract sportier   younger buyers personally   i m not into the offroad thing   i m looking to buy some acreage with incline   and i do like to go skiing   so this big heavy wd without the leather interior will do me fine downsides    the vertical size is such that i wo nt be able to fit it into my garage if i decide to install any type of rack system    it gets very poor gas mileage   so for those who commute unless money grows out of your pockets   it doesn t lend itself to becoming a daily driver    being a non traditional suv   it s missing a third row of seats   and luggage storage is a problem on trips unless you enclose the bed overall the truck lives up to the image that creates with their   big truck built tough   advertising strategies   it drives with surprising comfort considering it has the offroad suspension   and doesn t drift like aftermarket lift kits tend to do since it s new   dependability has yet to prove itself i also purchased a   thunderbird on the same day   if you would like to read its review   you can copy and paste    a href content   epinions content   a good luck and happy driving  
745,1,  in previous years i always thought of the taurus as my grandfather s first choice   but since the revamp of few years ago my whole opinion has changed over the past twelve years i have always driven t bird s   but in   the t bird was put to rest for a major overhaul and i began to look at the taurus   i am really glad that i did first off   the interior is really comfortable and roomy for this size vehicle   the dashboard contains exactly what you need   speedodometer   fuel   and a few other things that you need to know   the sound system is outstanding for a stock item   a c and heat perfect   one of my favorite items is the flip up console which is hidden under the arm rest   this allows you to use it or hide it   in the console you can store eight cassettes and has space for that soda coffee on the way to work   the back seats flip down for access to the trunk   not a feature that i would ever use   but i am glad that it is there   speaking of the trunk   i have not seen this type of space on vehicles this size in many many years performance and handling have been more than i could expect   gas mileage has been a very respectable as most of my driving is over the tollway freeway   appearance and paint surface are brilliant and show no sign of fading over the past two years   interior buttons dials are large and very easy to access from the drivers seat   one nice feature is the drivers side power window has a   quot one push quot   down button   touch it and your window opens all the way   i know it sounds silly that i ca nt hold the little button for a few seconds   but i really like the one touch feature visibility is great   todate i have not had any issues of blind spots with all the good   i do have one item that is poor   when driving on the freeway   exactly at mph    and either the driver or passenger window is down there is a very annoying wind vibration that fills the car   i can t really explain this sound   but it is kind of like a monk humming over and over and over directly behind your head rest this vehicle that comes in under   k is well worth your investment   i never thought i would own drive a taurus   but i sure am glad that took this car back from grandpa br br  
746,1,  i had leased a taurus for   years   and although not too flashy or great in any one area   it is a pretty nice set of wheels   its dependable   runs smooth and with no problems at all in my experience   once the automatic locked doors weren t functioning properly   and needed to be fixed   but that was most likely an isolated problem to my car the interior is comfortable and it is relaxing to sit in   althought a   quot compact quot   car   it doesn t really feel like it as there s plenty of space   it also seems that your a bit higher up while driving   also giving the feel of more room compared to smaller cars the exterior of the taurus is although plain and common looking   still pretty good there isn t much bad to say about this car   though it isn t the greatest either   i do recommend it to anyone who is intrested in buying a car   all ages   families   single people   it doesn t matter   this car can fit you br br  
747,1,  i bought a taurus gl with power package   cruise   automatic   cell phone    disc cd changer in late    it was a previous rental with   miles so i was able to defray some of the initial depreciation   and have been satisfied every day since   i have always been a honda man and have generally steered clear of american cars for their rapid depreciation   however when we had our second child i found it difficult to go on long trips with the stroller   port a crib   luggage   and various other newborn necessities due to the limited trunk space that honda s have i started looking around at larger cars   i wanted something with a v   plenty of room   comfortable on long trips   limited outside noise there is nothing worse than listening to the wind outside for hours and hours on long trips cruise and power amenities and a cell phone in case of emergencies i got all of that with the taurus   with plenty to spare   it is plenty roomy the trunk is nothing short of huge   very comfortable on long trips   i can take all of the hills with ease   a definite joy to drive   my one suggestion would be too consider one with a little bit of mileage as long as it has been cared for to cut down on depreciation   i was looking at a new   when i bought mine with most of the same features for grand   i picked up mine with   miles for grand   can you see the initial depreciation on these vehicles   i currently have   thousand miles on mine   i take it in for regular maintenance and have had no serious problems   i would definitely recommend this to anyone with a family who enjoys traveling br br  
748,1,  i ve owned   cars in my lifetime now   and i can honestly say that this is the most comfortable commuter car of all   i commute around   miles each day and now have    miles on this car   and yet the only thing i ve had to replace is the alternator   battery   tires and the windshield wiper mechanism   this is a solid car with the highest safety rating possible with my insurance   as an added bonus   it seats    while you d be hard pressed to find a car that does that these days if i had to complain   though i don t want to   it would have to be about this unexplicable   quot popping quot   sound while making turns   this has only happened occasionally   and it s occured since the first day i ve owned the car   i m willing to bet that this is a flaw of this particular car s design   rather than reflecting a flaw on the entire series   i have had it checked out several times and no one seems to be able to fix it or even tell me what it is   it hasn t caused me any problems though except mild bewilderment   i owned a   cutlass calais before this car   although they were both excellent vehicles   i d have to say that i like the style and comfort of the taurus better   i would recommend a   or older taurus to anyone and everyone   i bought it used with    miles on it   for      minus     from the trade in on the cutlass   when i started college   hoping it would last until i graduated   i am starting my senior year this fall   i have    miles on it and no major problems yet     
749,1,  i am not first in line to bash american vehicles and i am also not a disciple   which means i am able to remain objective about this car   my feeling is that this isn t that bad of a car   yet not great   i purchased my taurus gl used in   with k miles and it now is at k there are a few things that bother me about the car   but the transmission has always been my greatest concern   not long after i purchased the car there was a strange hiccup while driving that seemed to happen after longer trips   i never determined what caused it although it hasn t happened for a long time   it could actually have been the brakes which i replaced   although it felt like it was in the transmission   more recently   i had a very strange problem with my transmission which started with alternator and power steering problems   both would malfunction while driving   which later i found was caused by some kind of transmission sensor module   i later found out that if you don t fix it immediately   it really messes up your overdrive   which is what i am experiencing now i would say the other problems with the car are more annoying than major   the interior lights have a tendency to stay on after you shut the door   which i solved by pulling out the bulbs   the interior in my car is cheap and the rear window is hard to clean because of its oddball shape   also on a more personal note   the person who owned the car prior to me burned holes in the interior and stunk up the car with their smoking habit   i still can not get all of the smell out   which annoys me   on the good side   the v      liter standby has been a good performer i used semi synthetic oil in it   which may or may not help   if not for the transmission i would be more than happy with the car   adding that scosche sells kits for getting rid of the stupid stereo console   it is what many people call a   grandpa car   but if you are not vain about those things it is not a bad car   if you are mindful of the transmission problems and take steps to prevent the problems   it could be a good deal used  
750,1,  i received an invitation in the mail from a new car dealership that just opened in kenton   ohio back in august of    statewide had bought out another dealer and was having a kind of grand opening   present this letter and test drive any vehicle and receive a free tool kit   what i got was one mean sho   a   year old   just turned in from a lease with only    miles   burgandy with tan interior   chromed spoke rimmed   leather seated     liter    valve   duel overhead cam   fuel injected v with a moon roof and am fm cassette player with   cd changer in the trunk   auto temp a c and heat   auto lights   and a leather covered steering wheel   oh   did i mention it will do every bit of the   mph that the speedometer registers   well   it will   and the best part is it was only      i wouldn t trade it for a field full of monte carlos   grand prix   or intrepids   despite how fast it is and how well it handles it s also my family car   fixed or repaired daily   not this   i love everything about this car and hate nothing about it   i wouldn t recommend it to the faint of heart or someone who thinks only a mechanic can raise the hood   after all   i do add my own windshield washer fluid br br  
751,1,  i picked up a   taurus sho after looking over several   quot sporty quot   four door sedans   the car is very refined for a   almost everything in the car is improved or updated over the v taurii   it has sho specific engine   brakes   transmission   steering   upholstery   the list goes on did not market the sho very well   they are hard to sell   for this reason   new sho s can be found at the dealer for thousands under msrp positives the car is a performer   it is not a stoplight racer so much as it is an executive cruiser   it has the brakes and suspension to keep up with the   but not at the expense of a comfortable ride it has been    reliable since the day i bought it   it is the most trustworthy car i ve ever owned good ergonomics   one could drive this car for hours on end with little driving fatigue negatives the styling is definitely love it or hate it   the v is thirsty   frisky drivers can expect no better than   mpg in the city the oval shaped stereo    climate controls make it nearly impossible to upgrade the sound system br br  
752,1,  my husband and i bought a new   focus zx   comfort package   this past weekend   and here are my impressions so far   it is a really great little car   very responsive   very easy and fun to drive   and has enough pep with the   liter engine   we also tested the toyota echo and the focus felt much better   we were planning on buying a hyundai   either an accent or an elantra   just because they re so inexpensive and they ve got that great warranty   but the hyundais felt cheap   by comparison   the focus feels very well put together   very solid   very reliable   there s a lot to love about the focus   lots of head and legroom   plenty of cargo space with the seats folded down   they re really cute   very easy to drive   fun even   there are a few things that i ve discovered i really like   such as the fact that the reverse lights are very bright so you can actually see where you re going when you back up   the turning radius is great   i live in a big city so this is a plus   the seats are quite comfortable   the gauges are easy to read   and the controls are simple and easy to get used to   i like the fact that the cabin lights come on automatically when you turn the ignition off   that s really handy   a few things i ve discovered kind of annoy me about this car   the main thing i don t like is the clock   i have the cd mp player stereo   and when the radio is off   it s fine   but if you re playing a cd or listening to the radio   the time is displayed in the bottom left corner and is so small that it s difficult to read   you have to press the   clock   button on the upper right to get the time to display across the top for a few seconds   i wish it was the other way around   you had the clock display all the time and had to press a button to see what track or station you were listening to   another thing is the overdrive   i don t know if this is standard for at s with od   but its default is on   and you have to press a button to turn it off if you re driving in the city   on hills   etc   since i live in a hilly city and rarely drive the freeways   this is kind of annoying   since i have to remember to turn it off every time i turn the car on   the seatbelts are a little far back   requiring a bit of a reach   other than that   i am completely happy with this car  
753,1,  well i don t know where to start about my rig   my wife and i recently had a lil boy   and the truck we had a   dakota sport extended cab was just not big enough to handle a car seat in the back for the lil man   my wife called me one day while she was out of town and told me that i should start shopping for a new rig   so that was what i started doing   i new that chevy was coming out with a new super duty rig   i also knew that made a good   rig   so in all fairness i really started shopping around   i drove the new chevys   dodges   and the fords   in fact one dealership went to the local chevy and dealerships and borrowed a brand new   chevy and     both gas engines   i drove them both then drove the again   he then brought over a chevy   diesel and a   diesel   drove both of them   and again as before i drove the again   well to make a long story short   i literally took one month to shop for a truck   now here are the reasons why i chose the over the competition     the drives like a truck   i personally buy a truck to ride like a truck   not a cadillac   the chevy truck yes is a very beautiful rig   however when going down a bumpy road i didn t feel to of the road   personally that is not what i want   i want to be able to feel the road     the transmissions have been known to have a lot of problems   i personally had to have the transmission of my dakota replaced   times   when i was looking for a truck i went to a very close friend that just happened to be the service manager of the local dealership   he informed me that the fullsize trucks have more problems with their transmissions than any other truck on the market     the diesel was the loudest diesel on the market   even in the cab of the truck the knocking of the engine could be heard     the v   was by far the most powerful gas engine on the market   the was a lil less roomy than the chevy   but it road like a truck should ride   like a truck   the diesel was by far the well excuse my french but it was the ballsiest diesel i have ever driven   i was sitting at a stop lite and i punched it with out even thinking about   wow   is the only thing i could say   the truck actually squawked its tires at the line and was in the process of spinning them when i let off the accelerator   that was very impressive in my mind   i bought my truck which has the following options   f   super duty xlt   v    supercab   x   air conditioning   stereo cassette   cd player     rear end   towing package   towing mirrors   not a lot of options   but it is by far the dream truck that i have always wanted   i can t think of a better truck to own   i am currently in the process of making it my absolute dream truck   i have been told that with a   inch lift a set of   will fit just fine   well i am about to find out   well since i put this e pinion on here   i have made some changes to my truck   it is now   inches taller with   s underneath   and one hell of a lot more powerful   the only cons that i have is the seat belt design in the front and the lack of child seat anchor points   as fas as the seat belts   well i am a large man and when i get out of the truck if i am in a hurry and don t look back my seat belts get all tangled up in the door when it closes   and the child seat anchors are something that all vehicles should have in them   but you have to order them from the dealer   and then they will put them in   thankfully free   these are my only complaints  
754,1,  i recently purchased my   thunderbird from a women who took good car of the car and was the only other owner   she has papers on everything that she has had done on the car   but   now it seems like i have been getting all of the headaches of the car   i have only had the car for   months and i have had to replace the alternator   belts   tires   and some gas filter thing   can t remember the name   i know that these are the standard things to go in the car   but the parts are very expensive   we have to other brands of cars and their parts aren t nearly this expensive   this is my    warning the parts are expensive   also my insurance tripled with this car and i have never even had an accident or speeding ticket   there are also many unidentifiable noises in the car   popping noises from the brakes and somewhere in the back   there is also water leaking in when it rains   of course the mechanics can t find out what is wrong   overall the car is ok but not really worth all of the hassle and money i just recently got into a car accident with this car in april of   and ended up totaling the car   i was hit on the drivers side by a ram that was going   miles an hour   luckily i walked away from the car with only a bruise from the seatbelt   i was very lucky   however the car had to be destroyed   the car held up very well in the accident and i was very surprised that i didn t get hurt   this car is very safe to drive around in and you won t have to worry about getting hurt if you do get in an accident  
755,1,  buying my first car four years ago i searched high and low to find what i thought to be the   quot perfect car quot    for my needs      and one lemon later   i realized that i needed to be a bit more circumspect when searching for a used car   i sifted advice from a dozen sources   read books and did a lot of looking around   my decision was to buy a    taurus with    miles as much as for the excellent offer as for the technical knowledge i d gained about the vehicle   a bit of background first on buying used cars   this is surely not comprehensive   one owner is always a plus   if you can find an older person who is willing to sell   that is also good   more likely than not   they will have religiously taken care of regular and preventative maintenance and will not have beat on the car as young people tend to do no matter the make or model   i might add   they drive it as if it s a sports car   it s also convenient to have access to all repair records   there are stores that will even run the vin   vehicle identification number   to determine if it has had any factory work performed on it   i ve driven my car for four years now and i have logged over    miles bringing the total to    miles   i have driven in rain sleet   snow and hail   i ve driven on new tires   bald tires   performance tires and touring tires   i ve driven cross country and i ve driven locally   my point is   i ve taken this car through every condition possible   hmm haven t made it to the autobahn yet   and i m very familiar with it over the four years i ve owned my taurus   i have made substantial repairs   thus far i ve replaced all four brakes   two front disk and two rear drums   all four struts   the water pump   four tires   one window   and two front cv joints these repairs have been costly   but they were necessary for the mileage and their cost was certainly leveraged by the utility i received from the vehicle   most of the miles i ve logged have been highway miles from commuting   the vehicle   fully loaded with two passengers   would attain a fuel economy of   miles per gallon   avg   on long trips   more than   miles   for the shorter work home commute it averages     around town   the average drops   but that is to be expected from the extremely reliable    v   the engine is well known in auto circles as an economic choice that provides power when necessary   i have found it to be a great compromise without moving to a larger v   the car accelerates well which is not only fun to do occasionally   but necessary when making quick and aggressive driving decisions   indeed   most reviews will give the    l a hands down appreciation over its larger counterpart   the    l   because of its reliability   the latter has often had technical problems the ride of a vehicle or how well it handles inconsistencies in the pavement without disturbing the passenger depends on many factors   certainly   the road is a factor   but so are tires   inflation and type of struts and shocks   many cars today have progressive shocks which adjust to the road conditions and change the ride according to speed   though they weren t standard   i chose to have these put in when i replaced them   with properly inflated tires the vehicle provides an excellent ride even more so at high speeds as compared to a smaller vehicle   the car has power steering brakes locks trunk windows as well as ac and a   speaker stereo   these amenities are all standard the gl   while the car has an average wheel base   an average length compared to other vehicles of similar size   the trunk is spacious   i was able to pack modest luggage for four people into my trunk with some room to spare   while i wouldn t recommend towing with the gl   i found it to have the capacity and power to capably transport a full load of people and their luggage one inherent problem with a seemingly large number of pre   tauruses   enough that this problem had a small write up in a major automotive magazine   seems to be a knocking in the front strut area   this has occurred in my vehicle   and while i don t see any dangerous effects such as uneven tire wear or sloppy steering   this doesn t mean that it couldn t propagate in the future besides   the sound is not only annoying   it causes alarm in my passengers sort of a bump in the night though my be loved vehicle is aging   and i may soon have to lay it to rest   it was   dollar for mile   one of the best vehicles i ve purchased   and if you as a used car buyer are in the same position i was   i would encourage you to consider the taurus as a possible vehicle br br  
756,1,  if you re looking for a reliable and safe family sedan   then look no further than the taurus   i ve had mine for nearly eight years and it still performs like the day i drove it off the dealer s lot   the car handles extremely well and has plenty of passenger and storage space to accommodate a family of four   the gas mileage is adequate   i d prefer it to be higher   but the ride is comfortable and the design is appealing to the eye   price wise   there are few cars that can offer you what the taurus does at its price   overall   i have been extremely satisfied with my purchase and expect to keep this car for at least another   years br br  
757,1,  i bought a   taurus lx about     years ago   and haven t had any problems with it at all   aside from regularly scheduled maintenance and the fact that i got into an accident   i haven t had to take this car to the shop for anything   the car has    miles on it now   i bought it with     and the engine is still as smooth as silk   it has a lot of power behind it   wiht a   l v efi engine   the front seat is roomy and has lots of features   but the back seat can tend to be cramped   especially with me driving   but for smaller people is still very roomy   i wouldn t giv this car up for anything right now and will keep it until it finally dies for the last time br br  
758,1,  every year or two   i decide that it s time to purchase a new car   my wife and i have owned several car models   and two motorcycles   our last car was a   eddie bauer expedition   this was a program car that we got a good deal on   we quickly racked up    miles on it   in just over a year   last month   we decided to shop around for another suv   we looked at the durango   the envoy   and a few other vehicles   however   we eventually ended up back at   looking at the   expedition xlt   we bought it the same day   i guess when you find something you like   it s best just to stick with it b seating   the eddie bauer model we owned did not have a third row seat   the salesman stated that the third row is now standard in the expedition   the extra seat allows for comfortable seating for eight passengers   the third row is accessed by folding down the short seat on the passenger side of the truck   because the third seat sits up higher than the front two rows   the leg room is much more limited   however   it still allows enough room for average size riders to remain comfortable   it is an added benefit knowing you can carry extra riders   with everyone in a seatbelt b climate controls   the eddie bauer edition had a sunroof   which meant that there were no rear climate controls   i find this to be one of my favorite features   during the past few hot weeks   the xlt seemed to cool down faster than my eddie bauer model did   the rear climate controls have vents in the second and third rows   the rear climate controls can be shut off from the main control switch that the driver operates   just in case you have young children that think it s fun to run the heater during summer months b engine   the eddie bauer has a larger engine   sporting the   l triton   cylinder engine   the xlt has a smaller   more fuel efficient    l   cylinder engine   both models are   wheel drive   i have not experienced a noticeable loss of power with the xlt   but have not taken either vehicle   four wheeling   i have ample power for passing   i towed my motorcycle and trailer on the eddie bauer model   with no noticeable lugging on the engine   the xlt does not come with a tow bar   and i haven t installed one yet   i believe that i may notice the difference in engine strength once i start using the truck for towing   other than that   the power is more than sufficient for normal driving   i have been getting around   or   mpg in the city   and around   or   mpg on the highway b radio controls   the expedition comes with a decent stock sound system   i am not a power freak when it comes to speakers   as long as i can hear my music at a moderate level   without distortion   i am satisfied   the expedition delivers on this point   the sound system also comes equipped with a six cd changer   the cd changer is located in the center console   which is much larger than the older models   removed the armrests which were installed on the older models   and extended the width of the center console to compensate   this allows for several additional cds   other than the ones located inside the cd changer   the old center console did not even have enough room for the six cd jewels for the cd s inside the changer   the radio has rear controls   located on the back of the center console   these controls adjust volume   and change radio stations   it can be very irritating when a youngster realizes that they can change your station with their toes   while your tooling down the road listening to your favorite lrb song   but you can shut off the rear controls by pushing two of the pre set buttons on the radio   simultaneously b remote access   the expedition xlt comes with two remote control buttons   that allow you to lock or unlock the truck from a distance away   i have tested it from inside the house   and have successfully unlocked the truck   they claim that the controls are unique   there is also a keyless entry pad located beneath the driver s side door handle   which contains five buttons   with the numbers   through    two numbers per pad   the vehicle comes with a password   that allows you to unlock the door with a combination   a great feature in case you lock yourself out   i m still not sure where i stand on that issue as far as security goes   but i figure it would be quicker to break the window to steal a car   than try and figure out the password b comfort   i liked the armrests that the older models of the expedition had on them   however   i have adjusted my ride to allow for resting on the center console   the seats are very comfortable   and are great for long rides   i prefer the cloth seats of the xlt to the leather interior on the eddie bauer   because leather is very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer   the climate controls are efficient   the mirrors adjust easily   and the seats have numerous settings to get that   just right   position   in case you find the comfortable seat position   and find yourself short of the gas and brake pedals they have an adjustment for those as well   just pusht the button   and they ll come to meet you b handling   when discussing suv s   you would expect to hear how they handle off road   however   i do not intend to drive mine off road   i got a   wheel drive vehicle to handle the sometimes treacherous winter storms we get up north   since i have only owned this model for two months now   i have not driven it in heavy snow   however   i have driven over the rough post winter pot holed roads in my area   and it has handled the bumps well   smooth as glass   no   yet still comfortable   the vehicle corners well for a top heavy suv   and accelerates smoothly   except on steep inclines b car seats   i still have one child in a carseat   i have found the expedition to be one of the best vehicles i ve owned in regards to installing removing carseats b overall impression   i have been happy with the expedition   i think that the highest compliment that an automobile manufacturer can receive is to have a customer duplicate their purchase   i have never owned a product prior to the expedition   but have become a believer   at least in this model   the expedition costs a little bit more than some of the models in it s class   and less than others   the market has become flooded with suv s   with everyone getting in on the action   in fact   four classes of suv s have emerged   mirroring the car market   however   expedition is among the oldest and most time proven models of suv on the road   as long as my goodyear tires hold out   i ll be happy with my purchase  
759,1,  when my friend brian called me and told me he had bought a new car to replace his   explorer   i thought he bought a more sensible car   maybe a sedan or something   nope   i was completely wrong   brain bought a     expedition    with eddie bauer trim   boy   that is quite a truck the    expedition    is so large that it resembles a small school bus   however   it doesn t drive like a school bus   not that i have ever driven a school bus   and certainly doesn t look like one when you consider all that the    expedition    offers i   so what does it offer      i know nothing about the engine and so forth   so i am focusing mostly on the interior of the car and the exterior appearance       you could use those as a mirror     chrome   boy   it sure is beautiful   i am not sure i would want to keep up with chrome   having to polish it and keep it clean and so forth   but it sure is pretty to look at on other people s cars   the    expedition    has lots of chrome to look at   between its chrome bumpers   both front and rear   and its chrome wheels   there are plenty of shiny surfaces to look at   too bad you have to keep them polished and clean       brrrr   it is cold   darn   the windows and mirrors are fogging up     as it did today in d c   sometimes it snows   and snows   and snows   and other times   it ices   but then there are also the times when the windows just fog up   with the good old american defrosters on the    expedition     that ice or snow or fog will melt right off   but what about the mirrors   they fog up and get icy as well   how do you clear those   well   the    expedition    offers something new and exciting   heated mirrors   no more foggy mirrors that wind up being useless   de fog them and they are ready to go     speaking of the cold and the fog     fog lamps   the eddie bauer line comes standard with fog lamps mounted below the regular head lamps   fog lamps are not only for show   they also do help you maneuver in the fog   another cool feature   heated seats   the driver and passenger seats are both heated   a very nice addition for those cold tushies   and   there is also automatic temperature control   set the thermostat at   say    degrees   and it will stay there   automatically     daddy   where should i put this     when you have little kids   or are just a pack rat yourself   you need lots of storage   brian has two little girls   who are always in need of a tissue   another pacifier   a different cd   a cracker   or something else   well   where do you put all those things that a child might need   how about in your ample storage   there are two consoles in the    expedition     floor and overhead   the floor console has a general storage compartment   a coin holder   headphone jacks   a tissue holder   and   cupholders   the overhead console has map lights   sunglasses holder   a holder for your garage door opener   and a compass   overall   there are   cupholders throughout the   quot cabin quot   of the    expedition        going on a trip     there is plenty of room for cargo   as long as you remove the rd seat   more on this in a minute   there is a large area for cargo   there are cargo tie downs on the floor of the truck and a luggage rack on the top of the truck   on the cargo rack   it is easy to add some small packages to the cargo by opening only the glass on the rear hatch   there is a window door split so that you can open only the glass or can open both glass and door together     someone has been driving my truck     brian is exceptionally tall   so when i got in the truck to drive it   i   of course   needed to adjust everything ranging from the seat to the pedals   there are adjusting pedals for different height people   but when brian gets back in the truck   there is a memory feature that resets the seat   mirrors   and pedals to his original setting   nice     daddy   i m bored     when going on long trips   the girls often get bored   the nice thing is   brian s new car has a rear seat entertainment center   complete with a vhs vcr   now brian can put on a movie to keep the girls occupied during the trips   i am sure that is a godsend   and   for the adults   entertainment   there is a   cd changer standard with the truck     analog gages     voltage   oil   water temperature   speed   odometer   fuel     warning lights     door ajar    wheel drive   seat belts   low washer fluid   bright   highbeam   lights on   anti lock brakes   cruise control   parking brake   low fuel   check engine   airbag   temperature   low oil pressure   turn signals   and security system     power locks   windows   and cruise control       removable third row bench seat       remote entry   child proof doors   airbags    overall   i think this is a great truck   i don t see any negatives yet   except for the fact that it gets horrible gas mileage and that it is so expensive   overall   it seems like a great truck   and it works great with both girls   carseats   so brian is happy   judging from my experience driving the    expedition     i would recommend it to anyone who has the need for a suv br br  
760,1,  i didn t buy my expedition so i could run errands in town   or drive my kids to practice   i bought it to tow our   lb travel trailer and all of our camping gear   we couldn t have picked a better truck   with the    liter v     limited slip rear end   and heavy duty tow package   we can pull   lbs   the step up is very high   but once inside you re greeted by a panoramic view around you   a great feature is the power adjustable pedals which have a range of   inches   believe me   they really make a difference   there is a   inch height differential between my wife and i   but we can both find a comfortable driving position   more importantly   my wife can remain a safe distance from the steering wheel air bag reliability has been stellar   based on the time tested f   chassis   the expedition has proven itself both durable and reliable   our experience has borne this out   after   months     miles and several towing trips   my expedition has required only one unscheduled service call to repair a slow leak in one tire   yes   firestone wilderness    all four of which will be replaced by in the next several weeks gas mileage is a big drawback   i have averaged about    miles per gallon in mixed driving     when towing the trailer   but   again   i didn t buy it to replace my minivan   if you don t tow   you probably don t need the   l engine   but even if you don t tow   the expy offers size   safety and security for your family  
761,1,  the sporty appearance is unmatched   the interior w comfort convenience group   rivals that of a limo   when inside the vehicle the interior lighting and optional leather interior create an atmosphere of comfort and luxury the stereo system performs well with a   disc changer as optional   the third seat area is a bit hard to access and not made for very tall people but is adequate   removing the seat is a snap for extra storage space   it will also tip up for extra space in the cargo area   i have owned a and in my opinion the handling of the expedition considering it s size   is comparable   the optional   l v has tremendous power   the acceleration is scary for such a large vehicle   both from a dead stop and while passing the performance is awe inspiring   road noise is minimal   shopping around and using dealer against dealer will save you   k off of msrp   overall a great vehicle   out of   in my opinion  
762,1,  well   this is not the type of review that i generally write   i am a mom to   girls and am busy doing things related to raising them   i don t know much about the technical workings of cars   but i drive them a lot   i really felt compelled to write an epinion about this car we recently traded in our contour and purchased the much bigger crown victoria   try getting a family of six in a contour   no can do   so out we went to buy a larger sedan for my hubby to drive   he is no car expert either so we had to drive and redrive and sit in every car that seated    passengers comfortably   we did this    times while we were deciding what was the best car for us the crown vic was our choice hands down   it is plenty roomy in the backseat   my teenagers and kindergartener have plenty of leg room and space for all the stuff they must carry no matter where they go   the front bench seat will sit    but the middle person is a bit cramped   the airbags make it unsafe to put a child there   but that is really the size of the space   however   we can put an adult there for short trips and it works okay the drive is really smooth and the car handles like a much smaller car   there is ample power on acceleration and people get out of your way because they think you are a cop   i especially like the way this car brakes   i don t know any technical terms   but it is very responsive the crown vic gets pretty good gas mileage   about   mpg on average   the tank holds about   gallons of gasoline   the gas cap is easy to get on and off the trunk is huge and has a safety release strap in the event that you should somehow become trapped in there   great for those with adventurous youngsters   the only drawback of this car is that it is rear wheel drive   we feel that this issue was effectively dealt with the addition of traction control   which my husband swears by   we are thrilled by our purchase and it is a dream to drive this car   we got a great deal on the car and gave us extra incentive    financing for   months   can t beat it   i hope this review helps those that are not car experts   but want to find a really terrific car   the crown vic will not disappoint  
763,1,  my wife and i purchased a   e    seater for our growing family   with our sixth child on the way   our van is not loaded with options    while we have tint windows   cruise control and running boards   we opted for no carpet or power features to assist us in keeping the van clean with active children   and to minimize worries about equipment breakages down the years   we purchased using the internet   autobytel   to locate a dealer and set a price   we are pleased with our vehicle   after three months   and with the purchase process our van has the    liter v   engine   and it delivers very good power and acceleration   the gas mileage comes in at    mpg on the highway   and a consistent    mpg around town   the visibility while driving is excellent   with the height of the driver from the ground   and the large sidemounted mirrors   due to the vehicle length   lane changes require slightly more planning than a conventional minivan   however the large mirrors provide excellent situational awareness   both the turning radius and turning response are very good   and were much better than anticipated   parking requires patience   but is not a difficult task   including parallel parking the rear bench removes very easily with two people   one person who is capable of lifting   pounds can remove the bench   as well   with the rear bench removed   there are twelve seats and a tremendous amount of cargo room   although thought must be put into to securing cargo in the rear to prevent shifting do it yourself oil changes and fluid refilling are a cinch with this van   the engine was designed with easy access to wide mouthed filling spouts in mind   the great height of the bottom of the vehicle from the ground make it completely unnecessary to jack the vehicle for oil plug or filter removal we found the height of the vehicle made running boards necessary in order to facilitate the handling of children and groceries around the vehicle we have found our e   to be a superior value to any minivan out there   fuel mileage and luxury features are the only advantage we have seen of a minivan over our conversion van br br  
764,1,  my family and i own two aerostars and we just love them we have three kids and need the extra room if we are going on a trip or to the grocery store my husband have also hauled many things with these vans   he used to work as a service tech for a window and had to haul   hundred pound windows around for some of the services   he now works for a plumbing and hauls pipe everywhere   we have had little trouble with these vans   the biggest problem we have had is a transmission leak the vans are still running and one has over    miles on it and the other one has over    miles on it   these have been some of the best cars that we have owned and we got them both used   i could only hope that all the rest of the cars that we own are this good br br  
765,1,  the   econoline e   passenger van we purchased in november is a perfect fit for our growing family   we ordered this van in august   before the birth of our th baby and while we had to wait a few weeks longer than anticipated   it was well worth the wait after driving a minivan for   years   the size of this van was a bit overwhelming at first   but i love the height when driving around town and on the interstate   scraping ice and snow from the front windshield is tricky because of the height   getting in and out of the van is good exercise for me   since we have not gotten running boards yet   the van handles wonderfully   even in snow   parking the van is a learned skill   since some parking lots are designed with smaller parking spots   the cd cassette radio sounds great and is easy to use and program   the spaciousness of the van allows me to move pretty easily from front to back to help buckle and unbuckle my youngest kids from their car seats and there is plenty of space to put grocery bags during our monthly shopping trip   the only thing i have to complain about is the space between the front bucket seats and the engine hub   there is not enough space to sit sideways in the seat and slide around to the front this van is a must have for growing families   even if your family hasn t outnumbered the seats in a minivan   the kids will eventually be too uncomfortable in the cramped space br br  
766,1,  i have been looking for many years for a truck that will stand out from all others   i have found it   has made many models and sold millions   i went to the dealership where i live and i was shopping for a truck and as i walked into the show room there it was   this truck was the big foot of all   custom style with all the extra   this truck was made to stay in the showroom and their was not one other was like this one   i then looked it over and it had all i wanted and i was sold   i test driven   and i was surprised that this truck was made for me   i seen trucks of the same model on the lot and this one was made special   large tires with mag s   california concept detailing   i said to the sale man   i ll take it   there was group of people there wanting to take this truck out of the showroom and was told its sold   if i would of walked away and went on looking elsewhere it would of been gone   people come up to me and ask where did you get your truck   its one of a kind custom made   rear cab is custom with closure of the body color and lock   not with cab liner as most truck   this make more safe when traveling and packing all your extra in the rear   california concept is a that specializing in detailing with all the extra as tires and shields and medal steps side for that sporty look   if you go and look for a truck of this kind ask the dealership for information about california concept   and then you will have a truck you will love  
767,1,  we purchased a   f   in may of    we bought the base model and added only the    seat   cruise control   and a cassette player   we bought the truck to serve as a reliable vehicle for me to commute to work in and for us to take long trips in   we kept the standard v   engine which works fine if you are towing a small trailor and reasonable loads   in fact   i have never run into a case where i needed a larger engine   but i am certain that towing a large trailor or heavy loads would tax the v    the manual transmission is great   and it shifts like a car   it is very forgiving   however   the clutch is stiff and could be difficult for someone with knee problems the truck handles the road very well in rain and snow   and i have only a couple of times wished for   wheel drive   we have traveled from nj to la and from nj to il several times in the truck and it rides extremely well   there is plenty of room in the front seat   the rear seat on the other hand is not made for an adult to ride long distances in   we have put our two kids in the rear seat   and they seem happy   the th door makes putting a child into and removing a child from a car seat extremely easy   and a car seat fits perfectly behind either seat or in the middle of the rear seat   it is important to get measurements of the car seats though because some brands of car seats will not fit behind either seat   the bed of the truck is full sized so there is no problem hauling plywood unlike the new   door f s   i strongly recommend adding a topper   about      since it greatly increases the utility and security of the goods you are hauling as well as nearly eliminating the disposing of garbage in the truck bed it is a difficult vehicle to enter so if you are going to have someone whose mobility is less than normal riding in the truck check to see how easy it is for them to enter and leave the cab   whenever i drive my mother   i must give her a boost to get in and a hand out   riding boards help but do not eliminate this problem    wheel drive makes this even worse fuel economy is reasonable   i generally get    mpg normal use and about    on the highway   overall it is a great truck for the price and a great vehicle to see the country in br br  
768,1,  the f   series offers many people what they will be looking for in a full size truck   the front    seat offers comfort with driver side lumbar control   lots of leg room and head room for those that don t like to feel boxed in   all of the climate controls and radio are well within reach to improve road safety   the front seat offers a flip down console that locks in place for added storage   the rear seat is good for smaller children but adults don t think there is enough leg room   especially if the front passengers have there seats all the way back   the   doors make entering and exiting the vehicle quite easy for my   year old son   if your looking for a truck that offers a smooth ride than look no further than the f    the   wheel drive is a must for those who have to drive in inclement weather   no need to get out and   quot lock in the hubs quot   either the f changes from   wheel to   wheel drive with the quick and easy shift of a lever   the   l triton v   offers all the power you will need   whether you want to tow the boat up to the lake or have to drive up a snow covered hill   the f   should be your vehicle of choice br br  
769,1,  hello i love my f   supercab   the fourth door in the   s was a wonderful idea   i have had three f   s and by far this on is my favorite   it is so convenient to be able to go and open the doors from either side   packing and unpacking is so much better   the only thing i can think of is the noise reduction needs to be worked on   there is alot of noise driving down the highway   i have had it checked out at the dealership and they have told me that is the truck   nothing is wrong as far as the truck goes   please make it a more quite ride for people that enjoy cruiseing down the highway listening to there music   also   the fold down console is not very convenient for your arms   make the console longer   the fog lights are wonderful   i have been able to get home at night many times with your fog lights   i lived fifty miles out of town in the mountains   there were nights it was snowing so bad   i could not see the road in front of me   the fog lights is what got me home   i wouldn t have a truck without them   if anyone wants a wonderful truck   get yourself a f   supercab   you will wonder why you did not do it before now the seats are very comfortable but solid   this makes for a long drive a very pleasant and comfortable drive   remember   drive a f   and you will see what i am talking about     
770,1,  the f   that i have has been the best truck that i have owned   the comfort level of the seats and the interior is great   it came with the standard installed sound system   that has been superior   the rear opening doors have been a plus   easy in and out and with good latches and seals   the model i have has a   cubic inch    that has plenty of power   to handle the x operations   the automatic locking hubs leave a little to be desired   other then that the truck handles and operates with ease   the hub locking   is not what i expected   the thing i don t like is you must travel forward about   feet before they lock in   so if you don t lock them in before you start   you could be in trouble   and if you have to back up for any reason   they will unlock   and the whole thing starts over again   not one of s better ideas   the manual locking hubs are still the way to go   i bought this truck because fords are the only trucks i have ever owned   this one makes number   br br  
771,1,  this is a vehicle to love   i bought a   f   its terrific it has   doors   all the luxury s of a car rides wonderful it has a cd player power windows   abs brakes on all   wheels   the cost was      was like a steal   while there s no four wheel drive on this vehicle they do make them i didn t want   wheel drive nor did i want a v   this truck is a v   and still moves great   i had a ram before this and it rode just like a truck on the freeways it made me sick to ride in it   so if you want a truck with all the luxury s of a car and the ride of a car this is the truck for you   they are priced well and look great and run terrific   this truck has lots of room for a truck it fits   adults comfortably br br  
772,1,  all i have to say is if your looking for a truck the f would be a good choice   the f that i am telling you about is a   f   x supercab lariat   quot   wb flareside with a    efi v engine   when i was out comparing trucks i was looking for one that had the power to pass at any given time and the comfort of a car   i compared price and that seemed about the same   the selling points for me was the look   the drive   and the power   this truck rides smooth and doesn t do bad on gas as well   as for the power   it was unmatched   their are many different styles to choose from as well   some other selling points would be the compartment between the seats has plenty of room for anything you might want to put in there   although this truck is sleek   it probably would be a little difficult for some people to get in and out of it     
773,1,  when the demands of family life outweigh the number of seats in your regular cab pickup what can you do   trade up   this is my second truck   in fact i would say that this is close to my dream truck   my wife and i looked at the taurus wagon   the volvo wagons   explorer   subaru wagon and a few minivans   our main goal was to get a roomy car for long trips and to have a second car that could hold two child car seats and two more adults   a secondary issue was replacing my truck which is a   f   regular cab   i also wrote review on that truck   my wife was leaning toward the volvo and i of course wanted more truck after shopping around   i went on a test drive with the salesman   in the middle of the drive i called my wife and we stopped by to get her and my two boys   so   during the test drive we had two large male adults   me and the salesman both   lbs   my wife and two car seats with the boys   riding comfortably   my wife was really amazed at the space in the cab   with the bonus of having a truck bed let me describe my truck   it is a silver   f   supercrew xlt x     v    with the class iii towing package option and abs all around   it also includes cruise control   ac    inch wheels w owl tires     rear axle an in dash single cd player   power windows   power locks   power mirrors   fog lights and a bed liner   for all those with kids   there are tether anchors in the rear   during the first week i had the truck   i put approx    miles on it doing my work commute and routine errand running   my initial impression is that really softened the ride so that you don t get that jarring truck feel when going over bumps   no mistaking   it doesn t equal a car s ride   but it rides like a very smooth truck   in addition fixed the issue that i had with my   f    by moving the exhaust pipe to exit behind the rear wheel   the rear seats fold down to provide dry storage inside of the cab   it is a split bench in the rear   so i can still fold down    of the seat and have the two car seats in the back   in the front   you can also ride three adults comfortably   so it really is   passenger seating   this car is perfect for our   member family and is a great utility for us as homeowners   before we started our search i thought we would have to forsake the utility of a truck   however the super crew   and other four door trucks   covers a lot of bases some of the other things i have noticed about the truck are that the driver has excellent visibility of the road around him her   this truck has large mirrors and the hood drops away so that the driver can see what is immediately in front of the truck   the factory radio is decent but is easily drowned out when you have the windows down   the over head console has a compass and outside temperature   but no other information   i would like to see maybe distance to empty   gas mileage etc   the electronic odometer has a trip computer   the gauges on the truck show speed   tachometer   oil pressure   system charge   coolant temperature   the middle seat in the front folds down to be a storage compartment and has two cup holders   there are also two cup holders in the rear   i also have two outlets in the front   radar detector and cell phone   and an outlet in the rear located in the seatbelt anchor   this outlet in the back is perfect for cell phones and laptops   my wife likes the under seat storage in the rear also   behind the rear seats are storage compartments and one of them holds the jack and tire iron for the truck   the truck came with floor mats and treated upholstery   something similar to scotch guard so far the drawbacks are pretty standard   the gas mileage is an issue but is to be expected with a large truck that is v   powered   the other issue is that the brakes   while adequate   feel a little mushy   the    v   also only rates in my opinion as adequate   i have learned not to drive a truck like a car   so this isn t a big issue to me   the tires that came with the truck are goodyear wranglers   i don t have any complaints so far on the tires   but i like the dunlop rover lt s which are excellent in the rain   i will let you know how the wrangler s do b   mile update b this truck has done pretty well during the break in period   one minor issue is the adjustable pedals   gas    brake   there is a switch on the dash for moving them and it is not deactivated while the truck is in motion   i sometimes nudge the buttons with my knee   towing   i towed a   crown victoria to the auction   on an auto transport trailer     miles   the    v   was adequate task but could really use more power when towing something that large   like the   l v    with the overdrive disabled   the truck would really lug going up hills with the added weight   other than that the engine is more than adequate for family hauling and highway cruising   i was able to x with a full load of wood with no problem in wet muddy terrain   with regards to gas mileage    i monitor with trip computer and gas receipts   i am getting   mpg on highway and   in the city   my initial mileage   first   miles   was around hwy city    if we can put a man on the moon   we can make a light duty   x   v    funtional truck that gets   mpg city and   mpg hwy family duty is where the truck really shines   trips to sam s club with the family are a breeze with plenty of room for bulk paper towels   bulk food and other gargantuan grocery list items          at highway speeds the truck has very little wind noise in the cabin   compared to my   truck   also when the truck has a few hundred pounds in the bed and    people in the cab   it rides like a luxury car   when the bed is empty and you are by yourself   prepare to bounce over every bump   price you pay for hd suspension and having a truck   all in all i am very satisfied with my purchase at this point   my wife also really likes the truck now   we have to fight for the keys   she feels very comfortable driving it   good visibility   she likes the functional privacy glass in the rear to keep sun off the kids   the child locks in the rear are a plus and so far her only issue is getting used to climbing up into the truck  
774,1,   this is our nickname for our expedition   why you say   because it is such a huge   beast of a truck we first purchased the eddie bauer version of the explorer   last summer   because i was rapidly outgrowing my explorer   with two kids   car seats   baby strollers and expensive makeup cases to haul around   we decided it was time to expand we had always wanted an expedition and searched high and low until we found the exact one we were looking for    a black one with a sun roof   it s like a taste of freedom to open that roof and the closest thing i ll get to a convertible   we just needed more room for our family and this is the perfect vehicle if that s what you are looking for   too   it has a third seat in the back of the truck that can also fold down flat or you can remove it altogether gripe    however   you must be very strong to both remove and or fold the seat down   i have found it impossible to do this as a woman weighing   pounds   my husband even has a hard time with the seat removal so a lot of the time we just keep it flat   my oldest son is six and he had so much fun riding in the third seat   but i found it to be unsafe back there   i am a big believer in booster seats for kids and that is not the place for him   and   once all three seats are up   there is almost no room for storage at all    gripe    so now that you know how much i weigh   let me tell you how tall i am now      why   you say   well this is my problem with this vehicle gripe     i am just too small to see behind me   especially when i am backing up   the front seats are high   bucket seats which i think are an obstacle   i am thoroughly convinced this is a man s truck and not made for women   even though i see more moms driving them   i even tried sitting on an elevated foam pad but that made it even more difficult since purchasing this vehicle   the price of gasoline has gone up daily    gripe    can you say   gas guzzler to fill up the beast   it costs      at least   so part of the proceeds of this review will get me a gallon of gas if you live or work in a building with a parking garage   better check the height allowances    gripe    because this bad boy needs clearance of     i ve scraped many a garage roof   and let s not forget about parking    gripe    parking spaces are meant for cars   not trucks   it is always a tight squeeze to get into those spaces at the malls and once you get in to the spot   getting out of your car is a whole new issue   you must be thin as you try and squeeze yourself out between the cars   so what do i like about the beast   you say   three words   four wheel drive   love it   it has never let me down and that s worth it s weight in gold   i also feel very safe in this vehicle and absolutely hate riding in cars now   the beast sits high and proud   and it s v engine can really take off all in all   this has been an excellent truck   very dependable and spacious   but i m thinking about trading it in for a slightly smaller truck   i have become convinced that it is not the most comfortable car to drive and it is just too big for me   i take a lot of flack from men that i work with about driving such a monster truck   most of them are very envious of the beast    everyone has something to say about it   it s kind of like beast envy   this is definitely a macho truck and well worth every penny so soon i may have to part with the beast   parting will be such sweet sorrow   but   rest assured   my next one will also be black   four wheel drive and a sun roof   too   it just will have a girlier nick name   like   beauty     hmmm the search is on anyone wanna buy a slightly used beast  
775,1,  i ve driven fords since i got my when i was    from there   i bought a cougar   then an explorer   i now drive an eddie bauer expedition   i guess the one common denominator with all my fords is the awesome air conditioner   living in texas   with our summers   air conditioning is very important and i believe they get a good testing here when the temperature reaches over   for days in a row   to make matters more interesting   my current expedition is black   while driving home from visiting relatives several months ago   i blew up the engine in my expedition   i had just had the oil changed that morning   i crept into the nearest dealership in mineral wells texas and was given the bad news   paid for all but    of the new engine and most of my rental car for the next   weeks   what happened to the engine   i do not know   did handle the problem correctly   i don t know   the interior of the expedition has met all my expectations   there is ample leg room in the second seat for adults as well as children   behind the back seat is enough space for groceries without moving the third seat at all   with the third seat folded down   i have been able to tote anything i have need to   even with   kids and a dog   golf clubs   trips to sams   camping trips   etc   have all been accomplished without me ever having to take out the seat   the radio and cd player have been fine with good sound and easy to manipulate knobs and buttons   the handle in the back seat that hangs from the ceiling has gotten loose   and the clothes hook has come off on one side   otherwise i have had no interior problems at all   i know that the car runs well   however   my prized possession   the great air conditioning   is not the same   it takes almost an hour to get the ice cold air i used to have immediatly   i have plenty of freon   and no one knows the problem   i will be getting a new car in the next   months or so and i probably will not be buying another   not because of anything except i guess at   years old i should drive something else so i can have a reference to compare it with     
776,1,  the expedition is a wonderful suv   the expedition that i have the pleasure of owning is a   eddie bauer edition with a    liter engine   the engine is more than capable of pulling the expeditions weight plus another four or five thousand pounds of trailer   i have used the vehicle to pull a   foot sport boat to arkansas and the truck did well in the hills of the ozark mountains   stopping power with a trailer is also very good though added distance is needed of course   the    is also a very capable engine option in the mountains of colorado   the truck moves well with the automobiles of lesser weight and ascends quickly up the steep inclines   though    of a vehicles power is lost in the mountains the expedition had power to spare   the expedition does exceptionally well in the snow   i have four wheeled in about   inches of snow and could not get the vehicle stuck in drifts or otherwise   the vehicle is equipped with part time four wheel drive which allows it to be driven on dry roads with four wheel engaged   the truck senses wheel spin and puts it in four wheel drive only when needed   full time and four low can also be selected with the flip of a switch which lock the four wheels in drive mode the expedition has been a trouble free automobile for the past     miles   it has been to the dealership only to look at new expeditions that i will definitely purchase when the lease expires   the lease that offered has been trouble free and was explained well when i purchased the vehicle from woodhouse in blair nebraska   if you are hauling many people i e     then the rear seat is worth the    option price   however if you do not need it the seat is more of a hassle   when you wish to haul large objects in the back the seat leaves you with only one to two feet of cargo space when installed   the seat is however easy to remove with two people at each side   also if you plan to buy a lot of groceries with the seat installed plan on putting them in the back seat or picking up your canned goods that fall all over when placed on top of the folded seat back   the truck has only needed routine maintenance such as oil changes and windshield wiper fluid   the oil is extremely easy to change for the do it yourselfer because the oil pick up and filter are separate from the engine block   the filter is located right up front and is vertically placed so no oil drips out when unscrewing the filter   spark plugs on the overhead cam    engine last until    miles so i am not able to comment on changing those   however they look difficult to reach because the engine is recessed in its bay   the leather on the seats has held up well to wet swimsuits and dirty jeans   it cleans easily with a little leather cleaner   the only bad thing that i can comment on the vehicle is that it was not equipped with an outside temperature gauge   which is nice if the roads get slick and you want to see if it is freezing   it does however have an electronic distance to empty and compass gauge   the truck provides a commanding view of the road and is obstructed only by semi trucks and other trucks of that nature plan on spending about    to fill the tank from empty at     per gallon gas prices   the    goes through the gas rather quickly getting about    miles from a full tank     
777,1,  when we were faced with buying a bigger vehicle suitable for transporting more people   my husband wouldn t consider anything other than an expedition   he s wanted one since they came out in    his wish finally came true   in late february     we bought a   eddie bauer i m trying to   i really want to like it but i m going to tell you about our experiences in the   shorts months we ve had it   i hope this isn t an indication of what s to come our timing could have been better in buying this vehicle   we found it bought it on a saturday and the interest rates went up the previous monday   need i mention the price of gas   okay both of these are nobody s fault i ll start with the positive   the main thing i like is it gives you a commanding view of the road sitting up so high   i love the fact that the doors automatically lock when put in gear   since i have small children   i appreciate the child proof lock option i do not think it s hard to maneuver but i am used to big cars the temperature controls and radio controls for the back are nice a neutral point small children or shorter adults are the only ones comfortable in the third seat   the middle back is very roomy and comfortable   the back   quot hatch quot   if you will   is kind of hard and heavy to put down observation the further back you sit   the bouncier it gets now for our negative experiences   first   the third seat didn t come out as easily as we were told or as the owner s manual indicated   my husband ended up having to use some tools to undo something   i don t know   i wasn t here when he did it i wish there was more room behind the third seat and the door we hadn t had this vehicle for   weeks when i put the back window   right back door   down and it wouldn t go back up   we live   hours from the dealership where we bought it   we got it fixed locally and they reimbursed us two weeks later   on a monday   i m on my way home from taking kids to preschool when the   quot check engine quot   light came on   i couldn t get it in to the local shop until wednesday     later we found out that my husband didn t put the gas cap on properly after getting gas   since the gas cap wasn t on correctly   it was emitting illegal emissions   thus triggering the   quot check engine quot   light   the only way they can figure this out is by hooking it up to their computer wherein they get the error code   even if we knew the gas cap wasn t on properly upon seeing the   quot check engine quot   light   the mechanic told me that it would not automatically go off once it had been tripped   it had to be reset by a mechanic   okay   so why doesn t put a   quot gas cap quot   warning light on your dash or something instead of having to go through all of this   i let my husband get gas once in the fourteen years we ve been married and he can t even do that right   i ve taken his keys away so this vehicle has made two trips to the shop before we made our first payment   i m not sure how to answer the reliability question since we haven t owned it all that long and the two trips to the shop haven t really been engine related when i have a full vehicle while making the   quot preschool run quot   i feel like a bus   that s what the kids call it and the teacher commented that it was a pretty nice bus   i ve never ridden on a school bus as nice     
778,1,  we traded in our explorer on an   eddie bauer expedition and it was the best choice we have made by far   the cabin is roomy   the seats comfortable and easy to clean when the little ones get them dirty and feels like you re riding on air   i do wish we had a more current model   since now the foot pedals on the   models adjust to peoples height   as i am    quot   i would like that little perk   this suv turns on a dime   which is great compared to the crew cab pickup we used to own   much easier to handle in those parking lots at the mall   amp   grocery store   in addition   i didn t know that there was airbag suspension we bought the expedition   but there is   and it makes it a much more comfortable ride compared to that jolty explorer   i would recommend this vehicle to a family of three to seven   and the smaller the family   the better for a roadtrip   we just take out the third seat and pile up the back with our stuff   i highly recommend this one br br  
779,1,  i really love the expedition   i ve had it a year now and it still drives like it did when i first bought it   i used to own an acura integra but after having two children   we needed a more spacious vehicle   the explorer was the most popular at the time but the expedition caught our eye because of its size and luxury look   it looked like more than just a truck   we got the leather interiors   chrome accents and running boards and it sure looks great   the kids love it because we can take all their friends along and they also have   quot kid room quot   the far back seat is fun for them cause it has a little bounce to it my husband has found the vehicle useful for his new disc jockey business   he just pops out the third row seat and his equipment fits nicely in the back   i love how it rides and turns   it rides just like a car and handles really well   the only problem we ve had with the vehicle was an oil leak   the dealer was really great about getting it fixed right away   we re back to smooth sailing again we also took it on a west coast vacation trip from southern california to northern california   we ll never take a road trip in a little car again   you ride up high   you re in control of the road   it s great family fun br br  
780,1,  after owning   explorers we decided to order a new   expedition in the fall of    we ordered a x w   leather   pack cd    l engine and without rear seat or towing pkg   we also purchased the extended   yr     mile warranty   we have traveled extensively in this car since then   putting over    miles on it   total repairs have been to replace the front brakes at    and the rears at    miles   other than that we have changed the engine oil every    miles and the transmission at    miles   the original tires are still doing well   having rotated them every other oil change   they look like they have at least another    safe miles   no other problems   fuel mileage on trips averages    mpg   around town about   or so   i m satisfied in every way with this car and would recommend one to just about anyone that wants this type of automobile   the only down side is that it won t fit in all parking garages   we have found a couple where the roof rack will hit   i have found it an easy matter to remove the roof rack if i am going to be exposed to this situation   the car is a very smooth and stable vehicle on the road   it will cruise   miles per hour all day with no effort   when you get out of the comfortable leather bucket seats after a   hour run you are not totaled   as you are in some cars   we really enjoy it   another plus is the visibility   my wife enjoys the safety afforded by this and the size of the unit   if you are in a wreck you will probably be safer than in a smaller car     
781,1,  i just can not say enough about the expedition   i have owned one for the past two years and have been extremely happy with this vehicle   i have taken the family to myrtle beach on two separate occasion in this vehicle and the drive was pleasurable   my wife particularly loves the vehicle because she feels secure behind the wheel   it is a very safe vehicle and extremely reliable in any type of weather   during the labor day storm we had in the northeast   my wife was out shopping and got caught in the store during the storm   the power went out in the store and the customers were told that the store was closing   outside there was a number of trees and power lines down   my wife was very confident that this vehicle would get her home safely and that is what it did   there isn t a driving situation that this vehicle will not overcome   this vehicle is for everybody especially for a large family lots of room   love it     
782,1,  dear prosepctive car buyer we just got our expedition   year ago and we just love it   at first we had the next best thing   a explorer   and that was the tops   now   we have the expedition and we just live in it   we have a huge triton v    litre   this is just a monster   we can pull boats   trailers   mobile homes   you name it and the expedition can take it on   with just the right amount of space inside   this expedition does not even compare to the gmc sonoma or the gmc suburban    other cars we had considered when purchasing the expedition   has such an excellent reputation and it sure lives up with this   only in the shop for an oil change   it really lives up to standard from torque   to comfort and from luxury to power   the expedition blows away all other competitors thanks for reading my article write up     
783,1,  as soon as i saw this suv i fell in love and i knew no matter how long it would take me to save the money for this beast   i had to have it   for one   it s truly a luxury vehicle   it has all the luxury options of a lexus or bmw in a truck   it was when i drove it though that my love turned into lust and i couldn t get enough   i went to different dealerships every couple of weeks to   quot test drive quot   it   more like get my fix there are some things i d suggest getting on an expedition rd seat   it s light and easy to remove and you ll be thankful if you ever need to take   other people somewhere rear air   those   other people will be thankful if you have it i enjoy the   disc cd changer   it s great for the music lover and you commuter s out there i think the expedition looks a heck of a lot meaner with the   inch rims which in turn require the illuminated running boards   and last but definitely not least   do not   i repeat do not let any salesperson talk you out of the    liter engine   it s like the difference between a escort and a   no matter what other options you give up   get the larger engine br br  
784,1,  for   years i owned a jeep wrangler and i loved everything about it   then i got married and we had twins a couple of years later   well   the old jeep wasn t gon na hold all the baby things that come along with the babies   so we went looking for something else   it seemed to me that the choices were a mini van or an suv   i just couldn t go from a jeep to a mini van   there would have been way to much therapy involved   as we looked at the suv s on the market i noticed that the explorer   and others like it   were nothing more than a large sedan with a really tall trunk   we would still have to take two vehicles if we wanted to go somewhere with our kids and other friends and family   the expedition provided just the right mix   it holds all our kids stuff   is easy to get in and out of   handles extremely well   this baby will turn on a dime   and still allows us to take our kids and our folks out to dinner in the same vehicle   i have taken it off road on many occasions and have only minor complaints about its abilities there   it s easy enough for my little wife to drive and it fits into my garage   a fairly amazing feat with the size of garages being built these days   but that s for another review   bottom line is it is easy to drive   holds lots of stuff   and fits in the garage   sure the gas mileage really blows   but it s a small sacrifice for the comfort i get   i highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs space   comfort   reliability and something more manly than a mini van br br  
785,1,  i purchased a used expedition in late   when my job begin requiring me to go to remote radio tower repeater sites in the ozarks the expedition was simply the most comfortable vehicle i have ever owned   i felt very safe and secure with nearly   tons of metal around me   the   wheel drive relieved me of hiking into remote sites carrying   or so pounds of radio test equipment i thoroughly researched available suvs before i made the plunge   and the expedition was the only one which met all of the criteria for my uses the only problem i have had has been a small hole was worn in a   t   fitting on the engine resulting in a check engine light and rough idle   about    dollars at the deal fixed it i will probably be getting rid of it soon as my job duties have changed once again   and i no longer need the   wd   and i am driving farther to work   the expedition has the    engine with the trailer towing package and only gets about    mpg on the highway   i will most definitely miss it   but it s running me nearly    week for gasoline  
786,1,  i ve been a proud owner of a   convertible for five years   it is one of the best cars i have ever driven   i recently watched a tv program where they investigated the exploding gas tanks in   s mustangs   i think it is not as big of a deal as they make it out to be   in this tv report   they blamed for the deaths of several teen age drivers   in these accidents   when the mustangs were rear ended   the gas tanks were punctured causing gas to get all over the driver and burn them   the gas entered the car because of the fold down back seat   i know that in my convertible   there is no possible way for anything to get from the trunk to the back seat   only fastbacks have this fold down seat   shouldn t be blamed for any of this   if you own a car from the   s you should know that it isn t going to be that safe   when compared with other old car problems   this seems to be very small   i suggest that if you do own a   s with this problem you buy a metal barrier so that gas can not enter the car   you can get one in any restoration catalog for about     it is a very good investment to make   if you own an old car   you should be responsible and make sure it is safe   classic mustangs are the best cars ever and they don t need a minor flaw like this messing up their reputation     
787,1,  i got this truck new and it took all my money but it was worth it since it s a keeper   i thought it was a bust at first because it kept going into   wheel drive for no reason but i just called the assistance line and they sent a tow truck out   it turned out that the factory had left an extra spring shackle wedged in the front end somewhere which would rub on the front axle when you turned causing the automatic hubs to engage   anyway   they fixed it for free   there was a problem with the rivets on the frame but they fixed that for free too   the only thing they don t fix for free is the automatic hubs which went out once on me   i figure they need fixing once every three years which is better than getting out to lock them manually   i didn t like how low the truck sat so i got a    lift   big tires   and this reverse shackle thing on the front which makes it ride better on the freeway where it s all rippled   it s an animal on the ranches   goes up anything   even when the roads are washed out   once   i dropped the right rear in a ditch and the left front was in the air and i had to pull it out with the dozer but that s the only time it got stuck   it s got this turbo charged   power stroke diesel which will out accelerate the   gas version here in california   some people don t like it making a lot of noise but i don t care   i live in the country  
788,1,  go big red is what our f seems to shout to everyone who looks on   this flashy red truck with a v   and   speed manual transmission seems to have enough power for me and can spin tires without even trying   we purchased her recently from    jim s country    located at   l st   in omaha   the salesperson was originally asking      but we were able to negotiate down to      which was the bottom of the range that   first national bank of omaha    quoted us for a loan   i will discuss financing possibilities later in the review   we bought this truck to go back and forth to work and for camping   note my camping reviews   we do not intend to tow anything such as a boat b   positives    some of the features that we enjoy are   wide seating   enough for   adults in the front seat   heater that heats up quickly within the first mile in   degree weather   after a   minute warm up   reliable starting in cold weather   long   wide bed for camping   relatively smooth quiet ride   unlike my mazda b     miles with    miles and   months left on the warranty   there are also gauges on the dash   including   temperature   oil   charging and fuel   the dome light turns on automatically along with a couple of auxiliary lights   in the same compartment   behind the driver s seat   there are four speakers in the cab   giving a luxurious sound and great separation   there is a dual cup holder which pops out of the dash   just above the ashtray   this cupholder holds a   ounce soda perfectly   there is a dual cigarette lighter   perhaps one for lighting cigarettes and the other for power toys such as a tv   cell phone charger or auxiliary defroster   if you should not shut your door properly   a light comes on to tell you that your door is ajar   this truck features a   gallon gas tank   with   mpg city and   mpg highway   as stated on the original window tag also   i have found that this vehicle has more leg room than my mazda did   i normally would drive the mazda with the seat all the way back   even though many mechanics would move it up   i have found that i can drive comfortably with the seat moved forward about   inches   there is plenty of room in back of the seat   which is split      and carpeted on the back   there is ample storage in back of the seat   in case i wish to keep store purchases out of view   the dash is deep   about an arm s length   which i guess is neither here nor there   but perhaps worth mentioning   there are also pockets on each door   which would be handy for maps   coupon books   etc   there is also a compartment near the steering wheel for one to put small items in   the glove box is wide   but not very deep   one can see the traffic up ahead as this vehicle sits higher than most other vehicles   this vehicle has dual mirrors   the passenger side one is slightly convex b   negatives    some of the drawbacks   the bed in this full sized   wheel drive pickup is tall   it can be difficult to reach items that you put in the box   it will be difficult to scrape ice off the windshield in the middle of winter   also   i tend to hold the steering wheel by the horizontal bar that the horn is on   while driving   this is wider in this vehicle than in the mazda that i am used to driving   my large hands barely fit   a smaller woman probably wouldn t be able to use this gripping method   as the airbag is contained within   speaking of airbags   there is a place to turn off the passenger airbag   it may take a key   as i see a key slot   as well as a button   i will need to investigate this   however we have no small children in our household   the vehicle itself is wider than i am normally used to driving   i am unsure about fine points of parking this larger vehicle   the key can be awkward to turn off   as there is an extra lever which needs to be turned off   but perhaps it is this way in all fords                                                             ok   not even one month later   i am discovering that the heater control switch   the dial which switches the air from hot to cold is not functioning properly    sometimes   you have to turn the knob back and forth to get the warm air to properly fill the cab   it can force you out when it is zero degrees out   or feel lukewarm when it is   degrees out   guess they ll have to replace the switch   being too hot is not a problem   being too cool is   seems it only happens sometimes   but not when it is in the shop as well   as i was stopping at a stop light this afternoon   the check engine light came on   the owner s manual said this could be because i was out of gas   had water in the tank or a couple of other variables including emissions problems   wasn t running choppy at all   i turned the engine off and back on and it was still there   could this be a fix or repair daily   i hope things don t go wrong this regularly when the warranty expires in a few months   when i took it in for warranty work   they noted that a bad oxygen sensor needed replacing   which they did   free of charge   as well   the hazard lights do not always work properly   and sometimes only one out of four lights blink                                                               i took the in earlier this week because the overhead light did not come on consistently when i opened the drivers   door   they replaced the switch free of charge   one month left on the warranty also   i noted that when i drove home during a   hour trip on a very humid day   there was a bit of condensation coming off the air conditioning unit placed above my sandal clad feet   the water was not excessive   but noticeable upon my nearly bare feet   nonetheless                                                                 things seem to have gone well with this truck and we just put on    miles on a one week trip   the truck handled well on the rainy streets   it can burn rubber easily when backing up a wet hill   however i back into my driveway   which is on a hill   if i park on the hill   rather than the base of the hill   i can occasionally hear the truck creeking backward   my husband has successfully parked half way up the hill when encouraging the sun to melt the snow in the winter time occasionally the passenger seatbelt will make a ratcheting sound   it works   but the sound is annoying    the starter is starting to go out   it is not releasing   retracting or whatever it is supposed to do   we have    miles on it   the cost of a replacement   lifetime warranty   was     our average distance driven one way to work is   miles   we also run errands with this truck   it is also used for pleasure and long distance trips    times a year    i was shifting gears quickly to change lanes in heavy traffic   that is when the manual gearshifter knob came off in my hand   i suppose it could have caused an accident   mileage      replacement gear shift knob   approximately      we have about    miles on the truck   i was driving along perfectly well   i stopped for a minute and attempted to restart the truck   it kept turning over   but never started   when i did coax it to start   it ran very rough   and i was scared to drive it   seems the fuel pump went out   bill    we had a range of    from a private garage to over    at the dealer   the fuel pump is located by the fuel tank and one needs to take off the fuel tank to gain access the hood may be made from aluminum or plastic as it will not hold a magnet   unsure of the gauge of tin used elsewhere on the body what i really like   is the warning bell when you ve left your headlights on   the pockets alongside the doors are handy for maps   etc   i like the mini storage behind the seats b criteria   before i took delivery of this vehicle   i wanted to see what it was worth   we both looked in the classifieds and online   we called my bank    first national bank of omaha     and they said they would loan anywhere from     to     or so for this vehicle   i inquired as to financing and they quoted us     with my excellent credit   i also checked with my insurance    state farm    who quoted us    on a   month loan   the dealer    jim s country     went through   commercial federal   and was able to get us a     loan   when a day earlier he quoted us a loan rate somewhere in the high    range for persons with good credit another criteria that i had was to have my mechanic     keith pauley     owner of    all pro muffler and brakes     located at   s    st   omaha   nebraska   do a free mechanical inspection before the deal was finalized   we have been doing business with keith ever since he opened about   years ago   we went in there to have our brakes replaced on our chevette   only to have him tell us that all they needed was a free adjustment   he has had our business ever since   keith informed us that the parking brake did not hold on our new when it was on a hill   and the brake light on the dash had a short and suggested that we have this fixed at   h p   smith    as it was still under warranty   he also advised that the tires needed replacing     all pro    specializes in brake and muffler repair service   other than brakes and mufflers   keith s customers have demanded that he go into virtually all kinds of mechanical repairs   he is a straightforward person and will tell you the way it is   being nice in the process we asked the salesperson at    jim s country    to see if he could get us a good deal on tires   he called a nearby     t o   hass tires    located at   l st   who made us a good deal   we also went to   h p   smith    located at   l st   who very agreeably set up service for the items still under warranty   he even informed us that the warranty was   months longer than the salesman originally told us   also   the salesman mentioned that there were no recalls on this particular vehicle speaking of seats   i work the night shift   i make it a habit to take my lunch sleeping in the cab of this vehicle   it is very easy to throw your legs over the bench seat   rest your head on the driver window   and take a nap   taking a nap in our mazda pickup cab is a chore compared to this all in all   we are very pleased with our purchase   if things change   you will be the second folks to know    fyi   we used to have a f     which was a fix or repair daily however   the truck was a   owner   high mileage truck with a strong   v     my husband adds for some odd reason   my husband wanted to buy another   hopefully we will have better luck with this one  
789,1,  overview i ve been a man my entire life   they truly are the best made automobiles in the world   anyway   the   door explorer sport is definitely my favorite   it s an all around great looking vehicle   and i always get tons of compliments about it likes i am very particular about my vehicles   and the explorer still met all my needs   leather seats   power seats and windows   moon sun roof   cd tape radio deck   thermometer compass   and rear temp and stereo controls are all the great options i got   i think it is very smooth riding   even for a suv   while its only built for four adults comfortably   five can still fit   except you are short a seatbelt   dislikes there are not many things i do not like about the explorer sport   i do wish it had the on board computer that   door explorer limited and eddie bauer have   its just nice to know exactly how much gas you have left   your mileage   and instantly know your systems diagnosis of potential problems   all of which the inboard computer provides driving driving the explorer sport is awesome   in late april of   i was at an overnight camping party   no tent needed   just fold down the back seats and throw a sleeping bag back there   well overnight it started pouring and never stopped   we were at the end of the muddiest minimum maintenance road i ve ever seen   while everyone else got there cars trucks stuck on this muddy road   i flipped into   wheel drive low and drove through a muddy cornfield for   miles   it was great the explorer drives well in any conditions   i especially likes it   wheel drive handling   it is just great who should should not buy i really don t think you can go wrong with the explorer sport   since there are only two doors   dealing with little children and child seats   is probably not suggested   but for singles   a young married couple   an extra work pleasure auto   or even a truck replacement this is a perfect vehicle br br  
790,1,  to all of those who dislike their suv s   think again   this is finally a truck that lives up to the term suv   after owning many cars   and not having any luck   i finally found a vehicle that is dependable   this is my second explorer   and i love it   i purchased this one   months ago   and have only minor complaints   the only problems that i have had were paint related   and that was the dealers fault   seems they scratched it when prepping the car for delivery   i feel that the value of this vehicle is better than average   the reliability is better than i have seen with other suv s   i traded in my pontiac grand prix early and am completely satisfied   i have been reading a lot of other people s reviews   and am a bit confused   i am reading about how uncomfortable   or how bumby   or how much this car uses gas   well just a few questions   this is a truck right   it is not supposed to be a car   correct   knowing this why did you buy it if you are going to complain   there are a few things you should know about this truck before buying it   it is bumpier than a car   it does not get    miles to the gallon   and it will not do    in under   seconds   but then again   get the right setup and you can pull just about anything   drive through or over pretty much all that gets in your way   and feel confident that you have lots of vehicle around you   the only major complaint i have is that it does rattle a little   however i knew that going in to it   that is what a truck does   as i see it   you pay for the power   and ability   all i can say for the skeptics is   if you are looking for a well built   reasonably priced truck   this is it   if you want comfort   room   and gas mileage   buy a bigger truck   or get a luxury car   cause this ai nt it     
791,1,  explorer sport provides a perfect blend between sport utility capability and practicality for everyday use   while smaller suvs lack the weight   size   and wd ability   larger suvs sacrifice fuel economy and drivability   for instance   a honda crv is not nearly as well suited for rough terrain and or snow   with a structure that is derived from the honda civic economy car   it is nowhere near as durable and imposing towards bad weather   on the other hand   a larger suv   such as a expedition   or even a   door chevy blazer for that matter can make a driver feel disconnected to the road and make one nervous when trying to maneuver these battletanks around crowded city streets   with the back end somewhat shortened over   door models   one might expect a significant problem with cargo space   this is not the case   explorer sport has plenty of space to hold several pairs of skis with the rear seats folded down   also   visibility is a strong point of explorer sport   pillars are arranged in a manner that cuts down of blind spots fairly well   the explorer sport offers a great deal of strong points   not the least of them value   about the only complaint that i have with this car that offers incredible build quality is that the base is uninspiring   go with the    sohc as opposed to the ohv model   the extra   horses is a definite plus   particularly if towing is in your plans   all in all   though   i have nothing but praise for this well built   capable truck that offers a great blend of four wheel drive ability and normal day drivability br br  
792,1,  in september i purchased my explorer sport   model   at first all was well but once we went in for our   oil change everything went straight down the drain   several days later we heard a knock in the engine while the car was in park   i quickly called the service department and told them what was happening with the vehicle   after having my car for   days it was decided that was indeed responsible for this defect    although no one wanted to call it that legally   but indeed it was   apparently    some of these models made for the   year have a high incidence of carbon forming around the pistons and can and will if not taken care of completely ruin your engine   the catch   no one knows how often to have this problem serviced and how to keep the so called wolves at bay because it is a new problem   no one knows anything about it but this new problem can lead to disaster after time even with the routine maintainance prescribes   no one would guarentee that my engine would not blow up    nor could i even get as much as a report to the engineers about this problem because does nt consider it to be a defective engine    or the inner workings thereof   no one concerning this product is willing to take responsibility for it   nor are they willing to replace the engine ect because does nt want to admit fault with their product    at least not just yet i am basically driving a time bomb    and i would suggest to look for another vehicle to purchase because it is becoming clear that corporation does nt stand behind their product as well as it should   f o r d   fix or repair daily   br br  
793,1,  my husband bought me a explorer sport for christmas last year   and told me that it was going to be our family i was so excited to have a explorer sport   the prices do very depending on the options you get i have seen prices as low as     and as high as     our suv was priced at      i was disappointed because it seems like we got nothing for it our suv is pretty simple all it has is power windows and power door locks i really wish it came with an alarm   what i have discovered over the year is that it is a good car to have its very dependable on and off road i was staying with my parents and where they live there s a lot of dirt roads this suv can handle sand   clay   and rocks   i usually would drive about sixty on these dirt roads and it drove great it rides bumpy on the dirt roads and very smooth on the paved streets   off road lovers will love this car   the suv is pretty roomy it would be ideal for a family with child that don t have to ride in a car seat as i found out it is difficult to install a infant carrier and remove it as needed   for that reason i wish i had a explorer besides that its really roomy   as for gas mileage mine gets roughly   to   miles per tank a tank holds roughly   gallons   i feel that s a lot of gas for those mileage   i do suggest that couples with babies consider the explorer   door instead of the   door sport for couples with no children and children that don t need car seats would be a good buy     
794,1,  we recently bought a   explorer   used with only   miles on it   it has the leather package   am fm cd and cassette   upgraded speakers   and power everything   yet after all this negative hype from the media   we still wanted to purchase it   we love it just as much we thought we would   compared to the chevy blazer which we also test drove extensively   the was the best bet for the money   although we paid    more than we would have paid for the chevy   the came with options that made it well worth it   the interior is very roomy   and since we re starting a family   we needed the back seat which ample adult seating and leg room   the leather makes it nice because it s easy to keep clean and since i m a little short   i can slide right in once i hop up high enough   it hardly feels   too big   to drive and it s very easy to park   i love it  
795,1,  confession   i am a former member of the   i hate suv   club   but   having three large dogs   a seven year old   a   foot boat that i trailer   a wife who does arts and crafts shows   as well as living in new hampshire   i had to revoke my membership and take the plunge for what made sense    an suv   i had driven an older   door explorer and a   blazer   both seemed cushy   had roll and lean when cornering and lacked any type of road confidence   i test drove the   sport and was very impressed   the   sport   it has more than adequate power   there are no rattles   which my   taurus wagon specialized in   the vehicle seems solidly built   i love being so high up   also   the vehicle drives with confidence   steering is responsive and it corners better than any truck i have been in   no roll or lean    beware of overconfidence   the sound system is the best i have ever had in a vehicle   you do feel every bump on the road   and be careful of taking a corner above   where there are noticeable bumps in the road   but remember   this is a truck   not a car   the ride is quite and on a flat surface   very comfortable   as are the front seats   mileage is around   all round   but this is a big    engine and not all that bad for its class   oh yes   towing   i can t tell you how many times i could not haul my boat out due to low tides    yes   i previously towed with a taurus wagon   which probably hastened its premature death   this truck is an awesome tower   it does not cease to amaze me how well this truck tows a   pound rig   there is no strain on this truck at all   i am sure this   wheel drive monster will be great in the snow and off road   if you do that thing   i paid     for this   truck with k on it from a dealer   this may be the best vehicle value out there for my needs    haul the family   boat   art   dogs and family without mortgaging the ranch   as for the back seats   stop winning   you bargained for a   door and that is what you got   saving you a couple of thousand in the process and giving you a much better looking vehicle than the   door as well as adding a few miles per gallon  
796,1,  i m personally not a big fan of large suvs   they use massive amounts of gasoline mileage is generally in the low teens and owing to their nearly three ton weight and high bumpers constitute a danger to anyone in a smaller vehicle   especially if that vehicle is a lower riding car or minivan   yet even i am not entirely immune to their appeal   there is something fascinating about vehicles so large   probably the same thing that is fascinating about large beasts such as elephants and hippos   and large anything for that matter   size is impressive to the animal brain   recently i had a coupon for a free oil change at a dealer   it was supposed to be a   fast lube   but with nine cars in line ahead of me it was not   so i took the opportunity to indulge my revulsion fascination complex with large suvs by taking a   expedition for a test drive my motivations were a bit more sophisticated than i have let on   i knew that had substantially revised the expedition for    the revised styling follows the path set by the   explorer   with the largest change being a less round and more massive looking front end   most intriguing to me   steering changed from recirculating ball to rack and pinion and the live rear axle was tossed in favor of an independent rear suspension to improve handling    handling more than any other area affects my satisfaction with a vehicle   as in the   explorer   the new rear suspension permitted a much lower load floor   promising a larger rear seat there s also some history here   gm used to own the large suv market   then finally got around to introducing its own full size four door suv in    and that first expedition was instantly a success   gm responded with its own substantially redesigned large suvs in    and they ve regained some of the lost ground   this intense competition for high margin sales   large suvs command much higher prices than mid sized suvs   but do not cost that much more to produce   explains why so substantially revised the expedition for   b styling   as with the     a href content   explorer a b    click for my review   i like the new styling much better than the old   the rounder front fenders of the first generation expedition   as successful as they were at adapting s aero look to a truck   were just a bit too pretty for a truck   the new styling makes the vehicle look stronger and more up to date   rounded forms are on their way   out   without resorting to an overly macho theme   i e   the avalanche   some people complain that the explorer and expedition look too much alike   i don t have a problem with this personally   the point of styling is not to entertain auto journalists or third parties   the point is to give owners the   look   they want   if they want the   suv look   and the explorer is large enough inside   then that s the way to go   if they want this look   but need a larger suv   then that s what the expedition is for   no one complains that cheerios uses the same graphics on the oz and the oz box   right   and if every different size cereal box had a different look   wouldn t this lead to even more confusion in the cereal aisle   by similarly styling and naming its suvs   presents a clearer image and simplifies customers   decision making   finally   wouldn t it be worse if they looked different   and people who only needed a mid sized suv but really liked the look of the big one were thus forced to buy more gas guzzling truck than they need   so i have no problem with suvs looking alike inside the expedition has also been de rounded   the round forms of the old dash are gone   replaced by a more conventional arrangement   the most prominent features of the new dash are a large swath of black plastic across the driver s side and audiesque rotating metallic finish rings that adjust the volume flowing through the vents   to my eye   the latter are much more aesthetically successful than the former   i m not sure what all of this black plastic is for   minimizing glare   based on the mercedes line of thinking   the lincoln version isn t similarly blessed   so even if this is the line of reasoning can t be too committed to it   overall   i find the interior restyle less successful claims that the new truck s interior materials are an improvement   with vw as the benchmark   they are an improvement this is a nicer interior than that of the new explorer but vw is still a ways off   there s still a large amount of hard plastic to be found here    accommodations   hopefully   people who buy an expedition do so for reasons beyond an infatuation with size   to whit   hopefully they need to carry a large amount of people and or stuff over nasty roads   or even off road   let s cover the capacity issue first the expedition is a big vehicle in all dimensions   length   wide   and height   this permits a large interior   even after allowing for generous ground clearance   now   just about any car claims to fit three adults in the back seat   however   few have enough shoulder room to fit three comfortably   i e   shoulders not crammed into each other   middle person not sitting on a high   hard lump   etc   no problem here   all three rows have enough shoulder room for three adults to fit with little or no touching   a split bench is standard on the first two trim levels up front   so an expedition can be configured to carry nine people   the upper trim lines   including the top of the line eddie bauer i drove   are fitted with buckets and a center console   i found the driver s seat fairly comfortable   especially after i deflated the lumbar support   an earlier driver had pumped it all the way up   i found the driving position much better than that in the current explorer   in the explorer   the windshield header and sun visors intruded on my vision   it was like a billed hat i couldn t take off   in the expedition   i sat well above the dash   affording an excellent view out all around   yet the top of my vision was also unblocked   much   much better   no improvements possible here   huge mirrors were also much appreciated many cars these days do not provide enough interior storage   no problem with the expedition i drove   the center console   which reduces seating capacity to eight   has a huge storage compartment in it   a small dog could be stored in there or   more likely   a laptop computer and or good sized purse   this compartment was topped by a padded leather armrest   also nice   smaller storage areas are scattered throughout the interior the eddie bauer expedition i drove had the   climate control   seats   these include not only heating   but also air conditioning   each with five strength settings   i set the seat a c to     but never noticed a difference   i would suggest saving    by forgoing this option   except it s the only way to get heated seats   and these can be very nice to have on cold mornings with leather   you re call   just know the seat a c isn t worth much in the second row   the truck i drove had a bench split in three pieces   the middle piece can be slid forward   to position it closer to the front row   something parents with small children might like   two captains chairs separated by a center console with a large storage compartment   as in the lincoln navigator   are a    option   be aware that while the seats fold the console will not   so with all seats folded it sticks up a few inches above the otherwise nearly flat load floor   second row seat comfort is pretty good   definitely better than that in most smaller suvs and minivans   the seat cushion is nearly high enough to provide good thigh support   the cushion is padded and contoured enough so you don t feel you re sitting on a board   to get to the third row   either outboard section of the second row tilts forward in two fairly easy steps    not quite easy enough for children to manage   which might not be a bad thing the real surprise is in the third row   s main reason for eating the approximately    additional cost of an independent rear suspension was to avoid packaging a center differential with    or so of travel   this permitted the floor to be lowered nine inches   a huge amount   this lower floor permits two things   first   it permits a surprisingly roomy third seat   now   many vehicles these days offer a third row seat   including many minivans and an increasing number of suvs   i ve sat in many of these third row seats   i didn t sit in them any longer than i had to   though   they tend to be uncomfortable   and they tend to be mounted so close to the floor that my knees are at chest level   i don t like sitting like this   in the expedition   in contrast   the seat cushion is generously sized and padded and is mounted high enough above the lower floor that i had plenty of thigh support   move even than in the second row   overall   i found the third row seat to be the most comfortable in the vehicle   more comfortable than the second seats in most alternatives are far ahead of any third row seat i ve sampled   among suvs   only the even larger suburban comes close   quite an achievement the lower floor also permits this large   comfortable seat to fold completely into it   leaving a flat load surface behind   faced a choice here   they could have used the lower floor to expand cargo volume by making the seats removable   as before   they elected instead to keep cargo volume constant and thus substantially less than a minivan s and eliminate the need to remove any seats   ever   i suspect the great majority of buyers will favor this decision   as removing and storing seats tends to be quite inconvenient   for maximum cargo volume   though   a minivan remains a better choice   as the reduced ground clearance and removable seats permit a taller cargo area my test vehicle had the    power folding third row option   worth the     probably not to me   but i d suggest personally evaluating the effort involved in the non power version b on the road   the revisions for   have added a few hundred pounds to an already hefty vehicle   so even with the   horsepower    liter v acceleration is just adequate with a moderate load   by this i mean it felt neither underpowered nor equipped with power to spare   it moved as quickly as i wanted to   which admittedly is not too quickly   this being a large vehicle    the    a href content   toyota sequoia a b   is about equally powerful   the gm suvs have an edge here   towing a heavy load and or carrying a full load of passengers might lead some people to desire more power   but as i did neither i can not say   i can say that even when pushed the engine sounded quieter and more sophisticated than past expeditions and competing gm products   with the accelerator floored   the transmission shifted well short of the redline   at about   rpm   perhaps because going above that level on an engine with a low power peak makes no sense handling was another pleasant surprise   the steering and brake efforts were nicely firm where they used to be overly light   roll in turns is moderate   unlike past expeditions   i no longer felt i was driving a boat   not a sports car   either   but i generally felt the new expedition could be handled with adequate precision and   perhaps most important   a sense of control   overall   its handling felt similar to that of the toyota sequoia   sadly   the ride is not quite up to the almost lexus like sequoia s or even the tahoe s   over some surfaces the generally composed if not quite luxurious ride felt a bit jittery   though never uncomfortably rough   still   i never felt the degree of body on frame shimmer that turned me off the current explorer   overall   ride qualoty is adequate   but i expect better the interior is fairly quiet   even at highway speeds   with one qualification   whenever the a c was on   at any setting   a loud blower stayed on at the rear of the vehicle   i tried and failed to find a way to cut this blower off without turning the a c completely off   i think this blower recirculates air   pulling it through a vent at the very back   but even turning off   recirc   didn t kill it   there has got to be a better way   on the positive side   the climate control system appears well up to handle the task of heating and cooling all three rows of this large vehicle    pricing   the moderately loaded eddie bauer expedition i drove carried a sticker of      yes   quite shocking   but corrective actions are possible   the new   safety canopy    airbag to protect the first and second rows in a rollover   and   advancetrac    stability control   are impressive safety features   but together add nearly     to the sticker   i ve already mentioned the climate controlled seat and power folding seat options   another      not yet mentioned is the nicely sized but    moonroof   yet more can be saved by going with the xlt trim   where the luxury of leather is still available   equip an xlt to    a href content   honda pilot ex a b   levels   and the sticker drops under forty   still nine grand over the smaller but in some ways nicer honda   but more help is on the way   the honda sells at or above sticker   while according to edmunds dealers typically accept four grand under sticker   add in s current     rebate   and the likely transaction price for a still well equipped expedition comes to just over      suddenly the price seems quite reasonable   doesn t it   even further reductions are possible by doing without leather   front buckets   and so on gm s full size suvs   such as the    a href content   gmc yukon a b   tend to cost a bit more than the expedition   for reasons discussed in my review of the yukon   i prefer the the    a href content   toyota sequoia a b   costs much more than the or gm suvs   even though dealers are finally discounting them   the big toy is more refined   but low on power and not as roomy   i prefer the b last words   generally i d still recommend a smaller   more fuel efficient vehicle   but if you need to carry seven or more   adults   comfortably   there are few other choices   and those aren t much more efficient   for many uses   a minivan will do as well or better   but off road and or travel over uneven or unplowed snow covered roads can justify the space robbing   weight adding ground clearance of the expedition   with these qualifications   i can recommend this vehicle   with the changes for    the seating comfort   interior versatility   and handling feel now exceed the closest competition   acceleration   some areas of handling   and ride quality still lag   but among large suvs this is now my favorite b update november   b this fall nissan has entered the large suv arena with its pathfinder armada and has introduced a new   singificantly larger durango   after driving both my preference for the expedition remains   though the is a close second   the new durango is much quicker than the expedition   feels more maneuverable   rides better   and costs less   its disadvantages include a less comfortable third row   less shoulder room   and a cheap looking interior   the nissan is also much quicker than the   but its chassis feels very trucky and its interior quality is abysmal for a     vehicle i ve noticed that expeditions   front wheels are often thickly coated with black brake dust   they appear to have a problem in this area   if you must always have a clean looking car   plan on washing this one s wheels often my reviews of related vehicles b a href content   gmc yukon a b    equivalent to tahoe b a href content   nissan pathfinder armada a b b a href content   toyota sequoia a b  
797,1,  let me first preface my thoughts by assuring you that i do not work for any car manufacturer   after considering the acura mdx   chevy tahoe and toyota sequoia   i went with the   eddie bauer x   l expedition   i must admit that i have been reticent about american cars in recent years and at first was leaning toward the mdx   my primary fear was quality   however   after extensive research and a test drive of all four   i think has the best product for the price really did a good job with the new expedition   it looks like actually listened to the feedback from the previous expedition drivers   strange concept   and then built the new expedition   examples of what i am talking about    design   the interior design   while still american at heart   is clearly not the same old   for example   seems to have a habit of slapping together a confusing array of tiny plastic buttons and lights and then calling it a dash   did actually think that people like to have a readout that looks like one of those blinking light panels that spock always used to stare at   the new dash really looks somewhat like the new audi   see the air conditioning vents and two tone black and tan dash   i just wish they had gone all the way with this concept   there are still some of the old here with tiny buttons and green led lights   i d prefer    analog except where absolutely necessary     no more noisy wishy washy ride   the frame is stiffer   outside noise seems to be less   there is also rear independent suspension   the ride is really nice and the steering is apparently much improved    convenience   the third and second row seats fold down completely flat   storage is everywhere   the eddie bauer edition even has buttons to lower the third row from the back   no need to haul in and out huge unwieldy third row seats   seat memory   in dash   cd   pop down mini wide angle rear view mirror to keep an eye on activity in the aft section   dvd for the kids   second row middle seat slides forward   this is great if you ve got a kid in a child s seat back there    quality   i know that i just bought the thing   but the fact of the matter is that the expedition just seems to be built to last   no jiggles on the highway and a general sense of solidity    price   maybe i just had a better negotiating experience with my dealer   but the price i got it below invoice bringing the    sticker down to     when compared to the competition   this was hands down the best option on the downside   while apparently more efficient than previous models   the expedition still likes to consume gasoline   also   while most of the upgrades seem quality   a few seem like less than first rate   to give you an idea what i am talking about and i concede this is nit picky   the sunglass holder kind of jumps down at you when you push the button   in my   pathfinder   when you hit the sunglass holder button   it gracefully slides open   the leather also seems to be a little lower grade than some of the top of the line suv s   e g   acura  
798,1,  my husband and i went on the dreaded search for the new   family car   we knew that we wanted an suv   and were leaning toward the tahoe   i come from a diehard gm family   my parents have leased   tahoes in the last   years   and i had driven them frequently   i found them to be comfortable   however they always felt like they were top heavy when turning corners and such   i had read that the new expedition had come out with flat fold seats   and i knew that we had to check this out   i have to admit   i never thought we would buy a   but the minute i drove it   i loved it   it seems to have way more room in it than the tahoe   my husband is     so we need all the leg room    head room that we can get   i also love the way that you sit up high   it seems to give a better view of your surroundings   the interior is very driver friendly   everything is within arms reach   the center console is huge   lots of cupholders   even in every door   the seating is the real winner   really designed this well   the nd row of seats are separated into   individual seats   which allows for any number of seating arrangements   plus   the middle seat in the second row slides forward to be directly up against the console   it puts a infant right behind you   but for those of you without children   it allows for the people sitting in the rd row of seats to have a ton more leg room   we went on a   mile round trip with   very tall adults and everyone commented on how comfortable it was   they could not believe the leg room   the rd row fold down seats are the best   we knew that we wanted a rd row of seats for those rare times when we would need them   but we also knew that we did not have the room to store them   this was an answer to prayers   i find them very easy to put up or down   overall   we are very pleased with this vehicle   it does tend to slurp up the gas in town   but what big suv doesn t   it is very stable   turns on a dime   makes us feel very safe p s   my mom is jealous she hates her brand new yukon  
799,1,  i have a   probe se   it has approximately    miles on it   it is a five speed   the car has power windows   power door locks   power sunroof   and power seats   these are very luxurious and make the car very enjoyable to drive   i have the low profile tires for it which are standard on the se   the probe has an equalizer to compliment the stereo which has a tape player   i am going to get a cd player for it soon   the color is blue green and the inside is black and gray   the car looks very sleek and very sporty   i enjoy driving it every time   the car is quick and handles very well   it has an driver s side air bag and anti lock brakes which are nice to have   on the highway the car is very smooth and quiet   you can barely hear the engine running   the one thing i do not like is that once in a while there is a little rattle inside the dashboard which is common for probes   when i am driving it i definetly feel like i am driving a sports car   if i didn t know it i would think i was driving a porshe   everyone on the road checks out the car because of it looks and style   the sunroof is nice to have in the summer just having the air rush in over you   the people who should buy this vehicle are people who love speed   sporty cars   and quickness   there are plenty of saftey features on car so parents will like it for their children   anyone who wants a big slow car shouldn t buy it br br  
800,1,  i bought a   probe gt in    speed   no automatic for me   when i first saw the new designed probes i knew i would someday buy one   so when i got a good job i went out and bought my dream car   at first it was awesome i never drove a car that handled so good or accelerated so fast   everyone gave me compliments on how nice the car looked   but when i bought the car it had   kms miles   and with most cars this is when things started going wrong with it   i will list in order my problems i had    o sensors the probe has two of them when not working properly the car will use a lot of gas and show a engine lite on   parts are very expensive   note   if you live anywhere where they do emission testing the car will fail with the o sensors not working    valve cover gasket    oil will leak into the spark plug holes causing the wire to short out   gasket price is cheap but there is a lot of labor involved    abs sensor the car will make a buzzing noise and show the abs lite on   you can still drive the car like this but the abs will not work parts are expensive    water pump there is a lot of labor involved in this job too    i would definitely recommend to change the timing belt when doing this job because the probe has a interference engine and if the belts ever breaks the valves will crash into the pistons    air bag sensor lite   a lot of probes owners i have talked to have had these five problems the air bag lite sensor is usually the problem but i was told only the dealership can do the diagnostics and they are expensive   now i know that all cars have there problems but the probe is special in which almost all the parts on it are twice to three times more than most cars   from the exhaust to the struts   but i think sometimes in life you buy a car that just can not part with and this car is mine   i have heard of a lot of other problems the probe has   like the automatic transmissions have a lot of problems   but now that the probe is discontinued you can get one for pretty cheap   just make sure you check to see if the previous owner got this work done   above   just remember parts are expensive   and winter driving in deep snow is not fun due the fat tires and light back end of the probe   i still own this car today and have no plans to sell it   the probe has it own unique look where most new cars are all looking the same  
801,1,  i fell in love with the looks of this car the moment i saw one on the road   i finally got around to buying one last october    gt   k miles   and i paid   k for it looks like the previous owner hadn t done much with it   i got it from a dealer   so within a month i had replaced the water pump and the muffler   both of which failed on my first long drive in the car   cost me about   bucks for everything put together   but that s it     water pump replacement is part of the k service   which apparently wasn t done i ve currently got k miles on it   yes i drive quite a lot   and the only periodic expense has been the oil changes   at the k service i got the rear brakes changed and also the spark plug wires   total cost of service    or so   and since then things have been phenomenal   its a lot of fun to blow off v   camaros and mustangs at stop lights   even though they catch up with you down the road   but i have only praise for the acceleration of this car my car is black   and i wash wax her every fortnight   and i get a lot of appreciative looks for the trouble   she s a good cruiser    i ve done two trips of   miles and   miles   with no complaints whatsoever the niggling points are    body noises on all but the smoothest roads    that s supposed to be a problem for all   probes though    the idling screws up sometimes    varies between rpm and   rpm   but gets alright in an hour or so    the power antenna is stuck    another common probe problem probes are cheap   i have seen   gts with k for about    recently   so if you get a cheap deal   buy it    you certainly will not regret it if you keep the car well   forget about resale value though    you won t even get peanuts for this car   since i plan to run mine until the bitter end   i m not concerned about that i ve also done a lot of driving on back roads   i think the turning cornering capabilities are pretty good too   its a hard ride though    and i m too poor to replace the shocks   and takes some getting used to   the tires are dunlops   previous owner   and have decent grip   no fishtailing in the snow and that sort of thing if you want to buy this car   remember that the rear seat is strictly for emergency purposes i do nt know why put it in to begin with   this would have made a great   seater br br  
802,1,  in october of   i bought a   probe gt and it is the best car of its kind   i love the front room and the hatch room but no one can fit in back unless they are under    i dislike the performance probably cuz i m used to my old     off the start   it ai nt to bad   but after rd you just get blown away if you don t have mods which i am in the process of putting on   overall   the looks kick ass   and i would recommend the car for anyone who doesn t have    for a corvette br br  
803,1,  i bought my car in    it was built in    i was in college at the time   and it was perfect for my lifestyle   it is a fun   sporty car that was just right for a college girl   since i ve been married   i wish i had picked a slightly more practical model   there is very little room for groceries   yard stuff and other things that you have to buy when you live in an adult world with a house   and the backseat is a real pain in the neck to crawl in and out of i haven t given it up though   because i love zooming around in it   the radio is great   the car is comfy   and it handles wonderfully   i have had more than what i consider average problems with it   the brakes   exhaust   and muffler have all had to be replaced   the trunk latch has been broken for the past year or so   which makes it next to impossible to put anything in the trunk   the lighter was broken for awhile overall   this is a wonderful car if you have a lifestyle conducive to a sports car but no money for a sports car br br  
804,1,  our family purchased our   explorer xlt in march   from a good friend of ours who had to move across the world   we knew the car had been impeccably taken care of so it was an offer we couldn t pass up after driving around in the explorer for a few days   i soon discovered a new dimension of driving    seeing the road ahead   now i rarely go out to drive my father s car    i feel like my rear end is dragging on the road in xlt trim   the explorer fits anyones requirements for a vehicle   the bright beige interior is showing little sign of wear   the leather seating is slightly torn on the drivers seat   near a seam on the bottom   after    town hopping miles   a slight tear is much less than to be expected   ours came with   way power seats for both front passengers with lumbar and bolster for the driver and just lumbar for the passenger   they re still supportive and comfortable   the rear seat is like new    the only thing    on bumpy roads   the springs in the rear seat squeak   the rear cargo area is very durable   with a thick   padded carpet   the cargo cover still operates and provides added safety and privacy   the nicely equipped instrument panel is still fully operational as is the radio cassette player   occasionally a tape will jam   probably needs greasing up again   also   the center storage area has two large cupholders and a huge storage area for cassettes and underneath the cassette holder there is an area for cds or other stuff exterior treatments are shiny and the chrome glistens in the daylight   the factory tint or   privacy glass   is handy in high summer and really sets off the deep forest green exterior with the beige interior   the aluminum wheels are shiny but the lacquer covering was chipped on the edges following the firestone tire recall    bad mechanic procedures   i simply repainted it with regular lacquer and they re fine again the   l v   purrs every time it is started and never has hesitated and can pull me away from a stoplight with pleasant acceleration   it also comes in handy when pulling boats out of slips    even without a x system   it s still quite a capable vehicle   the ride overall is well controlled and with accurate inputs   the turns can be made so you don t feel like you re gon na fall out the car shortly after we purchased it   the freon in the a c system leaked out   where the car is located   you can still purchase r   from retailers so i filled it up again with a can or two only to have it gone in a few weeks time   i have since abandoned repair until i can find myself a r a conversion kit with some leak stopper where i live recently   a few other things have cropped up that are slightly annoying   inside the power window motors are three plastic cogs which slip anytime a finger or something gets in between the window   but    you can see this one coming   the plastic wears away over time and now the just sits there spinning around with no window movement   a good dealer told me to replace these with metal washers which have indeed done the trick next   the muffler has begun to break down   first   the tail end of the pipe started to crumble and now both silencing boxes are on the slippery slope of corrosion   i ll have to get this fixed soon finally   the latest issue has been the paint   the car is in the bahamas and the roof and the hood basically point to the sun and bake for hours on end   the clear coat on top finally broke away leaving bare base coat   in a hurry to preserve the steel panels of the car i had it repainted and it looks lustrous again   the doors and fenders   i e    anything that doesn t face the sun   were left with the original paint and are really shiny update   the am fm cassette unit which came standard died in the summer of    after a little research i found out the am fm cd players can be substituted with no wiring changes   then   i hunted ebay for a few months until i saw an early   s unit which would fit the    dash   i eventually found one   plugged it in and it is fabulous if you re interested in making this change   the radio removed was base part b   the radio with the toggle style volume knob   the base part c with the rotary volume knob is the perfect change for    and    model year explorers  
805,1,  in   i bought my daughter a new explorer with a promise from her that i drive it until she started college a year later   when she started to college she took the explorer with her and i drove another car   she drove the explorer until   when she purchased a     i sold the car i was driving at the time and took back the explorer   so you can see why i entitled this   quot recycled explorer quot we had problems with vibrations from the beginning   which i understand was a problem with most   explorers   the dealer from which i bought the car tried to correct this problem by installing shims   that didn t work and i ve been told that they should not have done this   this is the only major complaint we ve had with the car   obviously   it was not so big a deal that we sold the vehicle   it now has    miles on and still going strong   we have had to replace the anti lock brake system and i recently had the rotors replaced   but the rotors are a part of wear and tear that you would normally expect br br  
806,1,  i recently purchased a   explorer   december   and have loved it   i was looking for a suv   but because of financial restraints   my options were very limited   i have a taste for quality   so i couldn t settle for an old or bad looking vehicle   especially because of the size of a car investment   my choice on this explorer was great   now   to get to the car   i would like to say that it has tons of room   both in the front seats   back seats and rear cargo space   it is very comfortable and with all automatic features   it couldn t be more simple   the seats   mirrors   windows and locks are all automatic   when looking at other suv s of it s relative size   one overlooked feature that i have found to be very convenient is the option on the tailgate for opening either just the glass or the whole door itself   it makes quick trunk exchanges very simple   it has so far been very maintenance free   i have had it for just over   months now and it has not been to the shop once   with    miles on a sport utility   that is not bad   and the price was great too   oh yeah   and not to forget the four wheel drive feature   this too is activated with the push of a button   making the shift quick and easy for the emergency situations   the room inside with all the convenient features make this suv a great purchase for anyone   whether it be a family or just someone who likes the extra space for cargo or other needed use looking for comfort and space     
807,1,  my mom bought this suv a few years ago   and its been nothing but trouble   the and the transmission was already replaced in this suv   and it s only   years old      we bought it because of its sporty looks and durability and off roading ability   but we had no idea what was in store since i have gotten my learners license   i was actually allowed to drive this car   the explorer i noticed at first is very very preppy and has lots of horsepower   just stepping on the accelerator and it leaps forward   ready for action   when i m waiting at the stop line at an intersection   sometimes people look at me as a learner who just puts along and avoids everything   when the light turns green i leap forward and i beat everybody and zoom ahead   you should see the looks on their faces when i am way ahead of them   the x in the winter works really well   handles any kind of weather conditions   the only thing is that its really noisy when you turn it on and you have to go outside to switch the switch to go offroad   when you do   its a bumpy ride and juggly   the steering is crisp and responsive   but the power steering groans when you turn it too much   the brakes respond very quickly and straight the bad thing is that it has gone through a lot of repairs   either that or this is a lemon we got   the door handle has broken off   radiator replaced   timing belt broken   electrical problems   the lights go on and off for no reason   of course there was the daily tuneups and fixes etc   the windshield wiper switch is broken and the light switch is in a weird spot   sometimes the oil leeks into the   and burning of course creating smoke   it doesn t really go well up long   high hills without overheating   the seats are alright   but in the back its kinda uncomfortable after a while   not very cushy    when it gets to high speeds it jiggles around and starts squeaking and you can t hear the radio that well at highway conditions   at city speeds its fine   the radio that they give you is fine   but not great   also the gas mileage is not that great   especially when you have the x on   it just gobbles the gas up like crazy    not very good these days with the gas prices rising so this is a pretty reliable suv   and if you want lots of pep   this is the car for you   the only thing is that the repair bills is high and your wallet will get lighter   maybe ours was a lemon   but its good for a family br br  
808,1,  i bought this   wheel drive truck in february of   because i liked my   wd so much   the supercab has greater room for seat back movement and a larger     vs     engine   the only thing i wish it had is air conditioning   the autolocking hubs and push button   on the fly transfer case engagement have worked flawlessly   i get    mpg and the original x quot   tires lasted about k miles   amazing   one does get used to the power of the engine and it now seems a little weak   though i am sure it hasn t lost any ooomph   the cassette player started refusing to change directions and ended up   quot eating quot   tapes after   years   k miles   i replaced it with a jvc radio cassette   cd changer from crutchfield   i then heard vastly improved sounds from the speakers i will buy another when the time comes    or an explorer if i no longer need a truck   if you can find this truck with reasonable mileage and price   go for it   it is terrific in snow tis tough to give the   quot amount paid quot    below   cuz i traded in my     the price i have put in was the sticker price   get list and invoice prices from edmunds before you go looking for any vehicles br br  
809,1,  at first glance   it looks like you uncle ernie in florida s grand marquis    and some other times   it looks like the feds or local police are after you   but on the other side of the windshield   lies magnificent comfort   and classic large interior and seating   in leather on this sport model   look downwards to the   police radio    lol   and find a leather wrapped floor shifter for its butter smooth   speed auto transmission   this is not uncle ernies retirement car   it s a rocket ride   that s right   police and this sport share in the   horse power       new modular technology    v   along with real dual exhaust   i wish it were a tad bit louder   like its big cousin the maurader   but you can add from my research dynaflow for a slightly louder rumble   gas mileage has been fair to good   keeping my feet off the pedal is hard to do   especially when you turn traction control off   you can lay one hell of a big burnout   ala   s and   s style   the paint finish is fabu   no defects   inspected the engine and it is well constructed   although they could fancied up the engine area and added a nicer air cleaner     i would opt for a after market air filter and canister    and nicer trim in engine compartment would help   the wheels are   inchers and the tires goodyear   now if you read my article on the   jetta   you ll know that goodyear tires are somewhat soft and wear faster   we will see how these ls model tires work out   i ve seen the   crown vic sport and i can honestly tell you that the   is bound to be a classic   the wheels on the   are narrower to make way for clearance with the new rack and pinion front end on   models   i prefer the   look my self   also gone are the plush leather seats   they are now ala marauder style ribbed leather   so far i have put on    hundred miles and have had the first service done   also i might note that insurance for this car was alot less than most cars   thank goodness for uncle ernie   
810,1,    miles    brothers   and   years later our little   door lx hatchback blue escort is still capable of cruising down california roads   four days ago   however   the escort entered into retirement when i purchased a new car   the car has held up excellent throughout the years and is only showing signs a few minor problems now   well after    miles compared to cars today the lx escort offers very little in terms of options   it has an air conditioning system which provides ample amount of both cold and hot air   but when it s turned on the engine really loses a lot of power   it is not recommend to turn on the air conditioning when traveling uphill or at times when you need every bit of power the engine can give you   the car comes with a standard stereo which is basically an am fm stereo minus a cassette player   the speakers do an adequate job of handling any power   but again compared to today s standards sound terrible   they are not capable of handling very much bass before they start to make a crackling sound   the car also offers powering steering   automatic front shoulder belts   and a warning noise if you leave your lights on   the best feature of the escort has been it s gas mileage   i ve been able to achieve   miles on one tank of gas   with high gas prices in california   refueling my tank every   weeks or more was a blessing   the car is capable of getting more than   miles to the tank   but you may start dipping into your reserve fuel the worse feature of the escort is unfortunately the safety concerns   this car was built before airbags were required in cars   and because it s so small a massive collision could be potentially very harmful   although the shoulder belts automatically strap on they provide very little safety it seems   i ve pulled on the shoulder straps violently several times and they have failed to catch   i m not sure if this is age or if it happened when the car was new   since the car was passed down to me   the car also offers poor handling   the tires are small and overall the car is very light   high winds have a tendency to blow this car from side to side and you can t take turns too fast without feeling like your going to tip over   but the escort lx did exactly what it was supposed to do   it offered a quality car to get you where you wanted to go   this car offers no luxury but it wasn t purchased for luxury   it was purchased to get three boys to and from college   and it succeeded in doing that for   years   if your looking at purchasing an escort lx   kelly blue book recommends that the car price not exceed    to     this is for a car with no major mechanical or body defects   i think the car would be perfect for someone on a really tight budget that just needs a car to get them from point a to point b  
811,1,  the contour   a driver s car for the rest of us   for under      here is a domestic sedan that can keep up with the entry level offerings from germany   the contour s driving behavior is comparable to the audi a   volkswagen jetta   and bmw i   what these models have over the contour are uprate interiors of fancy plastics and bank vault feel as well as brand panache   better resale and superior available mechanicals   like audi s quattro and bmw s sporty rear wheel drive   but if you can t come up with        you don t have to settle for an garden variety accord   altima or grand am   unlike many inexpensive cars   the contour has a playful yet composed personality and is more than willing to be your curvy back road eating friend my contour is a    se sport model with the   l duratec v and the mtx    speed manual transmission   the sport trim level added features like alloy wheels   the v   spoiler   fog lamps   leather wrapped wheel shifter   floor mats   my car also features leather trimmed seating and a power   sliding moonroof   since i had to take delivery on a car from a dealer lot to get cheap      months   financing   i didn t get all the options i wanted   it is difficult to find the contour in the v spd form   at least in my urban location   other options i wanted as well but could not find on a lot were abs   traction control and a split   folding rear seat the duratec v is one of the contour s greatest assets   it s not a perfect engine and some close competitor s engines are arguably better   like vw s   l vr   but the duratec helps elevate the contour from a tempo replacement to something unexpected for an inexpensive domestic compact sedan   it loves to rev   it makes sweet mechanical music   it doesn t wheeze or sound stressed   it pulls all the way to the fairly high redline of   rpm   mid range torque is excellent for this class   tasks like passing and highway merging are relaxed   fun   when you have the duratec   the power the duratec generates surprises other drivers in their hp v mid size sedans   it also surprises the college kids in their integras as you pull away from them   i wouldn t necessarily call a v equipped contour fast   but it is certainly spirited   what limits the duratec s appeal is a lack of low end torque and an unrefined transition when the secondaries kick open at rpm   some people like the kick from the engine at rpm   however   after driving german vs   i prefer a smooth build up of power   not an abrupt one   but the kick is part of the engine design   not a problem   and helps give the contour a little edge   a little personality   overall   the duratec is similar to a honda vtec engine albeit with less refinement and turbine smoothness   but with a more workable powerband one of the best things about the contour is the availability   actually it s standard   of a   speed manual transmission with the base cyl engine and the duratec v   you can t get a v spd on the accord   grand prix regal intrigue   galant   altima   malibu or grand am alero   the contour s manual transmission is easy to use   the shifter is of the notchy variety   while most enthusiasts prefer the rubbery feel of bmw s stick shift   the notchiness makes it easy to find the contour s gears   the clutch is fairly strong and relatively easy to engage   it doesn t require much pressure and isn t as   quot spring loaded quot   as some other clutches   the contour is my first stick shift car and i found it a very good candidate to learn on    honda s manuals are probably the best for novices   as any car geek will tell you   a manual transmission allows you to have real fun with a car   the spd transmission allows you to keep the duratec in its powerband for passing and for turns   together   they make the contour a reason to get up in the morning if horsepower and flat out acceleration were everything   i d be driving a camaro z with its   hp   l v   but as i ve said before   the contour is a driver s car   not a stoplight racer   what allows the contour to be compared to the german models is its grasp of the driving fundamentals   handling   steering   brakes   you can throw the contour around   it s easy to brake before a turn and control the car through the turn with throttle   there is moderate   but predictable understeer   the steering is very communicative and adjusts its attitude over various speeds   at low speeds   you can feel imperfections in the road and anything that might get you in trouble   it is also responsive   at fast highway speeds   the steering is appropriately heavy and not twitchy   the suspension feels very european   the ride is supple   though some american drivers will find it too harsh   since i am in my s   i don t care so much about ride as i do about handling   unless you buy a world class car like the bmw i   you have to make a compromises between ride and handling   a base se or lx will have a smoother ride than my se sport   but with lower roadholding limits   the contour has a very reassuring pose that rewards spirited driving   body roll is present   though not a problem and is a bit better controlled than others in this class   steer the contour through an emergency maneuver and the car stays planted to the road   after a sudden move   the car regains composure quickly and waits for your next input   although the contour may not be loaded with the latest   quot safety feature of the month quot   i consider its excellent driving mannerisms a big safety feature   the contour s brakes are very good   a result of a nice   progressive pedal feel and a system that stops the car straight and short   the brakes have a good bite that may surprise you if you are used to the weak stuff gm makes all these qualities add up to a car you ll probably drive just for the heck of it   you ll want to find those little used back roads to play on   i ve taken my car out for a few drives where i try to nail it to redline   take turns at high speeds and   of course   develop a very brisk pace   the car is very stable at mph and i have managed to take it to    at that point   i feel like my driving ability is at its limit   rather than the car   even after a tiring day of play   the engine and brakes maintain their performance   this car has high limits   if you don t typically drive in a spirited fashion   you ll still appreciate the contour s driving competence   it produces few   if any   surprises and the reassurance it provides might make you pick up your pace a little bit   likely without you realizing it the contour is america s   series   it has a real enthusiast s engine   a proper manual transmission   a suspension that grips the road well   steering that communicates and brakes that stop without incident   it is not a   series equal   however   and i do not consider my car an apple for apple replacement of a bmw   for instance   the contour is front wheel drive   while all bmws have rear wheel drive   bmws have better refinement and higher limits   but we aren t talking about a     car here   a nicely equipped i   you can t reasonably expect a     car to equal a     one   and the contour doesn t   rather   the contour gives you the best version of german engineering of any american asian car under      that includes the intrigue   the toughest argument against the contour is the vw jetta   the jetta certainly has a better interior by far and its vr engine is a real thrill   but it costs thousands more   doesn t handle as crisply and has a meager yr k bumper to bumper warranty   on paper   the jetta appears to be a winner   but since you can get the contour near invoice whereas the jetta goes near sticker   the battle lines blur from a practicality perspective   the contour is less impressive   though still capable   the trunk is fairly large and has much usable space   entry exit is easy from the front seats   though the much scorned back seat has room for improvement   it s tight back there and i can t imagine having   adults sit there anymore than a very short distance   since i am single   i use the back seat floor as a way to convenient way to haul groceries and other items   they roll around in the trunk   visibility is good from the front and sides   though the rear view is a little abbreviated   the dashboard has a simple design and buttons are easy to locate   however   the stereo is too low in the dash   the front cupholders are possibly the most pathetic feature in the car   they can t hold anything   i really like the appearance of the instrumentation    crisp and easy to read   however   i can t stand the econocar plastic that abounds in the interior   vw does a much better job in this aspect and i wish would give the contour better feeling and looking plastics   the door panels in the contour are completely plastic    there should be a cloth leather insert   the seats are comfortable and although they don t have an adjustable lumbar   there is plenty of lower back support for long drives   since i drive the contour in a spirited fashion   i wish the seats would hug you a little better   the contour s heating and cooling systems are first rate   although they have the old fashioned hot cold dials   not an actual temperature setting   the heater puts out tons of heat and the ac can be downright icy regrettably   the contour can t completely shed its american car reliability stereotype   in   months   i have had   warranty claims   the first was to replace a strip of trim on the roof   the second was to fix a wiring harness behind the headlight switch   the third was to fix a heater blower resistor assembly   the fourth was to replace faulty insulation in the front bumper crash sensors   the last three were official recalls    addendum      the number may become    i read in autoweek that   contours are being recalled for frayed accelerator cables   all of these claims are troubling   but i don t know what to make of it   having   warranty claims in the first   months of ownership would suggest the car is a junker or lemon   however   my contour really hasn t let me down   the warranty repairs themselves haven t been major in scope   the dealer has been able to make the repairs the same day   also   has been the one making the recalls   i haven t had to bring my car into the dealer for problems that i ve found myself   i suppose i can put up with these issues simply because i love the way the contour drives and since it has been reliable   however   i think i will be looking for another car after the    mile warranty expires   that s a shame to be honest   i was scared to buy the contour because i feared it might be a repair nightmare   i was driving a   honda civic at the time   which had not given me any problems in k of driving   i was used to the stereotype that japanese cars drive forever but american cars are fixed often rarely driven   i got over my   probably misfounded   fears and bought the contour   using the fact it had a fresh warranty as an excuse   although my contour hasn t been flawless in the defect department   i don t worry about it breaking down on me   it may not be a toyota corolla   but it is a reasonably well made car   i ve taken it on many trips   including a cross country one   without incident   from what i have read from others   the contour is no tempo and bests the poor reliability history of the stratus and malibu other areas of interest   i m not happy with the fuel economy   fetching mpg in suburban driving and a max of mpg on the interstate   my heavy right foot is partially to blame   but the thirstiness is made worse because of the smallish fuel tank     gallons   fortunately   the duratec happily drinks regular    octane gas   the stock tires    firestone firehawks    aren t performance tires and limit the car s performance abilities   the headlights are abysmal   i find myself using the high beams a lot   cabin noise is unremarkable on the highway   with some wind and tire noise protruding   but nothing out of the ordinary   there is a convenient storage space for cds in the center console   though the right driver armrest can get in the way while the contour as a complete package is flawed   so is the competition   what makes me   and others   such fans of the car is its remarkable driving behavior   you just can t get this kind of performance and joy from any other sub k sedan   the contour is a reasonable choice    it is functional   inexpensive to insure and operate   not a theft target   comfortable   fairly stylish and is reasonably priced   unless you have a growing family   the car should accommodate all of your passengers in reasonable comfort   the contour s last model year will be   as it is being replaced by the new   and excellent   focus   that s a shame because has a real winner here   one that can be made great with some reworking and refinement final note   while i recommend the contour with the v and spd options   i do not recommend the car with the cyl zetec and the automatic transmission   this drivetrain takes all of the life out of the car   if you need an automatic   stick with the v   if you can drive stick   the cyl zetec is an acceptable   and economical   choice br br  
812,1,  with    daughter preparing to get her license and inherit mom s    passat   i went shopping for a replacement   the short list got very short   however   when i decided to consider only cars with timing chains rather than belts   demanding a chain limits your choices to most gm products   including the saturn   cyl s   and the duratec v family   the contour was the perfect size    it ll fit   adults in back quite comfortably   although   will be tight   and it has a large   useful trunk   this year it comes in only   flavors   the loaded se sport with the quick    v   or the very loaded svt with the very quick    ho v   and   given that it was mainly designed by of europe   where it is sold as the mondeo   its character   amp   demeanor are markedly european   making it the natural successor to our old vw    volkswagon has taken its prices so far upmarket that they didn t even rate consideration   the seats are more sculpted and orthopedically shaped than anything else   or any other domestic   offers   very similar to those found in volvos   the thick   leather wrapped wheel fills your hands   while the interior isn t plush   with all vinyl door panels and no chrome or wood trim   the car has some nice thoughtful touches such as a fold down armrest for the driver s bucket and door rocker switches for locks   amp   windows that illuminate at night   the car we bought had the automatic transmission and premium stereo with in dash cd   i passed on abs   amp   traction control   sticker price was     the local dealer that participated in carpoint responded with an offer for     or about    over cost   i feel this is an excellent price for a car with this level of equipment   and the deal was made all that much sweeter with a    rebate from   this car is a joy to drive   the engine feels eager to run   and the revs come up with turbine like smoothness   shifting is crisp without feeling harsh   and the computer has adaptive capability so that the car soon acts as if it could anticipate exactly when you want it to shift   the car steers precisely and responsively   it s nicely balanced and very easy to drive quickly   it feels very much like the cougar which is based on this car   but has the stealthy innocent look of a   door sedan   the contour and its mercury sister the mystique qualify as s best kept secrets   the cars receive virtually no advertising   and are destined to be dropped after this model year   this knowledge has induced many enthusiast owners of older models to trade in now for the latest model   it s a pity to see this car go away because it has sporting yet sophisticated qualities that don t come through in its replacement   the focus     
813,1,  i had never considered buying the contour svt   but i happened to see one at the dealership   i thought    quot i can t afford that quot   but after looking at the sticker and the markdown sticker   i seriously considered it as part of a former job   i have driven quite a few cars   i would have to say at least   different models   honda   accord   civic   prelude   chevy   cavalier   beretta   camaro   monte carlo   vw   golf   gti   vr   jetta   passat   pontiac   sunfire   grand am   acura   integra       taurus   escort   bmws   audis   volvos   mercedes   lexus   many suvs   etc i test drove the svt and immediately knew this was the car for me pros power   v   hp     liter dohc   made by the same guys who make the cobra   wow   great mid range and high end power exhaust   the sweet tone is like no other   really reflects the power of this car handling   it outhandles any car in it s price range hands down   even better than cars around   k such as the bmw and audi   sticks to the roads and carves the twisties short clutch   many   speeds   such as the   have a clutch that s really high   the svt was the perfect height loaded car   moonroof   leather   power windows   doorlocks   amp   seats   keyless entry   amp   trunk release   for lights    quot   alloy wheels   z rated tires huge trunk   actually is a little too big    should have made the back seat bigger euro styling and feel to the car cons road noise   at high speeds back seat   way too cramped quality   the interior plastic and parts seem kind of cheap i have just passed the recommended   mile break in period   somewhat babying it   i have opened it up since then and am completely addicted   the svt begs to be redlined and the exhaust makes it that much more difficult   winding roads are a blast to cruise on svt has done a wonderful job with this car   it s too bad it s to be discontinued after the   production year i would highly recommend anyone looking for a   k ish car to check this bad boy out br br  
814,1,  the contour was introduced as a   model and was s first attempt at building a world car   the contour was designed and built in europe and is sold there as the mondeo what model is the best to buy when i was shopping for my car i drove several different models of the contour   i tried a   cylinder automatic   a v   automatic   and a v   manual   i also tried the base and sport models   the best model is easily the v   mated to the   speed manual   however   if you prefer automatics that transmission is a good choice too   it never lets the engine strain and always chooses the right gear quickly and smoothly performance this car s performance is the most convincing reason to buy it   the sport model s wide low profile tires have superb grip   the car s suspension holds the car down great and it definitely has a european handling flair   the front disc rear drum brakes are excellent and have a great feel to them   the suspension of the v   model is definitely stiffer than the base model   though it never feels like your riding in a sports car either   the v   engine is far smother than the four cylinder and has a great sound to it s exhaust   the   cylinder engine accelerates fairly well   but the v   is by far worth the extra money   interior the interior is the only sore spot of this car   and especially in back   the front seats on the sports model are extremely comfortable and really hold you in place when the going get s rough   the dash was redesigned in   and can still use work   the vent on the passenger s side is positioned awkwardly   and it is hard to get the air direction right   the lower part of the dash houses two very low and shallow cup holders   and a storage shelf that can barely hold a pen   the power window switches are mounted vertically on the door in a position that makes them hard to use   the rear seat is cramped but like the front seat it is very comfortable   the stereo sounds great but the buttons are small and many serve dual purposes that are hard to decipher   other than those minor glitches the interior is definitely designed for driving and the driving position   seats   steering wheel   and climate control system are excellent reliabilty consumer s reports rates the   contour average   the v   is more prone to problems than the four   my friend receives a contour as her car and has had an electrical problem   and a recall on the engine mounts   besides that she is very happy with the car   overall anyone in the market for a small car should definitely take a look at the contour   if the contour s interior proves to be a problem than take a look at the mercury mystique which is basically a contour but sold by mercury   the mercury has a redesigned dash and interior which solve most of the contour s problems   why is nobody buying the contour my guess is the interior   the rear is not sufficient for a family with older children   and the minor details done wrong on the inside affect a person s decision greatly   however   if you re looking for a fun to drive   comfortable   affordable alternative to a corolla or saturn the contour is definitely the way to go     
815,1,  as opposed to the the volkswagon jetta which i also looked at   this car has plenty of power and at about the same price as many of the foreign counter parts   at about     you get a well equipped vehicle with a v   engine and performance tires to match   road noise is a little loud and the stereo system leaves a lot to be desired   overall comfort however is very nice if you are under ft in   there s plenty of room for   large adults and if you not too picky about the stereo system this car makes an excellent all around car   trunks space   what can i say there s plenty   i put a rack stereo component system    units   and a computer   gas mileage is pretty good however they only put a   gallon tank in the car so it seems like you re filling up all the time   i average about   miles per tank   so if you re looking for a vehicle that has sports feel both on the road and on the pedal this car is for you   i mean you can feel the road and the steering is easily readable   if you looking for luxury this may not be the car unless you get the leather package with power seats   supreme sound and all the little perks   it s an ideal family car for the small family    wife and two kids   and an excellent singles car that can be used for business or pleasure br br  
816,1,  greetings   what follows is a blow by blow account of a head to head comparison test of the contour and the plymouth breeze   if you own or are thinking of purchasing either of these vehicles   this should prove to be very interesting reading for you   i have toned it down to about    words   in the interest of not posting a novel here on epinions    earlier today   i found myself with an interesting assignment   to pick which of two cars was the   quot better quot   car   a close friend was shopping for a compact sedan   but she hated the idea of not buying american   after much discussion   mostly related to styling   she narrowed it down to two cars   the contour and the plymouth breeze you see   this all began several weeks ago when my friend s car   a wheezy old     was diagnosed as needing a new automatic transmission within the next month or so   the car was driveable   but definitely on the way out   knowing that i am a   quot car guy quot   she called me up and asked me what she should buy   choosing from only compact   four door north american models that can be bought for well under      she was thinking     or less we immediately ruled out the pontiac grand am as she felt the styling was simply too funky for her more conservative tastes   especially the dashboard which appears to have been lifted straight out of a sci fi movie   i actually like it myself   she also ruled out the focus   as it too struck her as a little too weird   interestingly   she really liked the looks of the contour   she also liked the design of the plymouth breeze   saying that is was definitely   quot neato quot   and was not too weird for her so   having effectively narrowed it down to a used contour or a plymouth breeze   we set out in search of a prime example of each   she decided that she would probably be best off to pick up a used   model of the car she chose as this would save her several thousand dollars   you know the scenario   champagne taste   coca cola budget so   as luck would have it   after lots of searching for a couple of really clean cars   we happened to find one of each on the same used car lot   a red   plymouth breeze with    miles   and a white contour with    miles   both were automatics   and had power windows   door locks   and mirrors   am fm cassette stereos   cloth interiors   and   cylinder engines   we drove the breeze first inside   the plymouth breeze is deceivingly roomy   there is plenty of room for four   foot adults to get comfortable   the back seat even features a nifty fold down and pull out dual cupholder in the back of the front armrest   the opposite was true of the contour   the back seats are tight for six footers   and rear headroom is non existent   hitting a nice bump on the freeway would definitely result in the rear passengers bumping their heads on the roof if they were    quot   or taller   the breeze won that one hands down   it feels much larger from any seating position   even though on the outside it s almost the same size as the contour the breeze has the nicer looking gauge cluster   and more in the way of interior storage compartments   of course   as is typical of chrysler products the interior looked and felt like it was put together on a strict   under allocated   budget   the plastics are definitely rental car grade   and the controls do feel unsubstantial and sort of rubbery on the other hand   the contour was missing something i insist on in any car i drive   a tachometer   even with an automatic   a tach can be very useful   especially in a car with overdrive transmission   the contour feels smaller   both in terms of interior space and overall size   without a doubt the plastics used on the dash are of higher quality than those found in the breeze   the steering wheel in the contour scored major points with me for it s thick   meaty feel   conversely   the steering wheel in the breeze is nothing special and is immediately forgettable despite being direct competitors   these two cars feel very   very different   the breeze feels more like a typical american car in that it feels large and roomy   and it handles like a small boat   road feel is not a term with which plymouth is well acquainted   the steering is vague and uncommunicative   leaving the driver feeling like they are driving a small buick conversely   the contour   derived from the hugely successful european mondeo   offers the driver excellent road feel   for an enthusiast   this makes the drive more fun and makes the car more predictable   inspiring more spirited driving   for the average consumer the contours excellent steering imparts a feeling of having better control over the vehicle   thus making them feel safer    this elusive trait is why bmws are known as the   quot ultimate driving machine quot   the road feel in a bmw is quite simply the very best in the world as for power   neither car is exactly a road rocket   but thanks to its superior handling   the contour feels both faster and much more fun to drive   in all honesty   the felt faster from a standstill   although we obviously did not conduct instrumented testing   the s brakes were definitely better than those in the breeze   but bear in mind that both were used cars surprisingly   both cars have great trunks   one would expect the contour to have a small trunk   and while it s not as deep as that found on the breeze   it is surprisingly large and usable   of course   the breeze s trunk ultimately is the larger of the two one of the biggest subjective differences between these two vehicles is the quality of materials and level of fit and finish   the felt like it was put together very well   in fact   if i may be so bold   it felt downright european   conversely   the breeze felt like it was good for maybe another    miles before it came apart at the seams   the plastics are super cheap   and squeaks and rattles were certainly noticeable   the breeze left us with the impression that we had driven a cheap car   while the contour felt like a shoe string budget bmw wannabe   no kidding so   which did we choose   in case you haven t guessed yet   she bought the contour   we both felt good about the purchase   especially since we negotiated a great deal on the car   she is thrilled   and she especially likes the styling of the contour   when we took a good long look at it   she felt the breeze looked like a plastic toy   especially the grill and mirrors   and i must admit that the front end of the contour is very pleasing to look at   the cat s eye headlamps are very elegant apparently   the contour is one of s most reliable products   time will tell   and i must admit that i am somewhat pessimistic about its projected life span   of course   it s not a plymouth   i am not a fan of chrysler products   so i definitely think she picked the better built car overall   i was very impressed with the s performance and overall packaging   except the rear seat headroom thing   i had pretty much written off as a manufacturer of below average quality automobiles with little or no finesse   the new focus excluded   a pleasant surprise   i could actually sort of envision myself driving a product and actually liking it for the first time in years   of course   i would probably opt for the   cylinder svt contour all in all   the struck me as the better car   i think she choose wisely   of course   neither car would hold a candle to a used nissan altima   honda civic   or vw jetta in my books   but hey   this car wasn t for me   my pal insisted on an american car   and i personally think she got a great set of wheels for her money    br br  
817,1,  i was able to drive this car for the past couple of weeks   when me and my brother decided to switch cars   he drove my    mercury mystique and i drove his    contour   i was very impressed with it s handle on the road and the little added horsepower that the mystique doesn t have   i ve been driving the mercury mystique for the last year and have been pleased with the car   what really surprised me when i started driving this car is how similar it is to the mystique   the interior is almost exactly the same and the feel of the car is also similar   so with that in mind price should also be compared   we paid about the same for the car   his being a year newer gave him the advantage   i think that mercury mystique is a special kind of manufacturer so you spend some money on the fact that it is a mercury mystique    things about the car   comes with the nice anti lock brakes for all wheels power windows and door locks i think the contour is the svt   and in the    models that particular type of contour has more horsepower   to the se and lx s   it has a v engine   it has more torque than the other models also miles per gallon   which is   important   now adays   is     city hwy has cruise control and air bags seats now more than   comfortably   it is a very luxurious ride if i may say so it s a safe ride   even though it has more horsepower than the mystique   the feel when you drive it makes it just as safe   it s hard to explain   other than it feels safe when you drive it brother bought it at about     i would recommend this car to parents who want a safe and dependable car for their children to drive   also to people who do a lot of driving to work everyday   it s gets good mpg   is it better than the mystique   even though they are two very similar cars   the added horsepower and cheaper price makes this car a little bit better br br  
818,1,  i m publishing this review for those of you who are considering a purchase of any v model contour   i bought a   contour svt   special vehicle team   because i like high performance european type vehicles without the high costs usually associated with any euro model car that fits this description my initial test drive of the   contour svt made me smile   which isn t all that easy to do when it comes to cars   i demand a vehicle that can really perform and handle well in the twisties and at the same token   deliver good looks and carry four people with relative ease   i purchased my   contour svt new in december of    it is now november of   and i currently have k miles on the odo in retrospect   i can give an honest and well experienced review of the pro s and con s of this   door performance sedan   if you are on a budget and want a   door performance sedan   this is definitely a car to consider   performance is right up there with most bmw s at a considerably cheaper price   what are the pro s by far the biggest pro is the performance the svt model offers   but even the non svt models are good performers for those who don t want to pay the premium attached with the limited production runs that come with all svt cars   car and driver hustled the svt from a standstill to mph in just under seven seconds      and through the quarter mile in    seconds at mph   for those of you unfamiliar with performance statistics   lets just say this   door performance sedan will keep right up with almost all v sport coupes on the market priced under   k   and beat quite a few of them in the process   handling is even better   generating   g s on the skidpad   which means you ll most likely exceed your own personal tolerances well before you approach the car s handling limits   the svt s front bucket   leather is standard in the svt models   seats are very comfortable and very supportive during spirited driving maneuvers   overall steering feel is excellent   with only mild understeer once the handling limits are reached or slightly exceeded   and the power assist works wonderfully at any speed   as far as the ergonomics go   the trunk is spacious for a car this size   and the controls and gauges are all laid out clearly and easy to use   so what are the con s mostly fit and finish in the interior areas   i ve also noticed some suspension noises   clunks and rattles   especially during the colder seasons of the year   interior noise isn t up to par with most cars   even in its own price range   cup holders are horrible up front   and non existent in the rear   there are inserts that sells that solve the problem up front though   interior lighting leaves much to be desired   there is no glovebox light   a real inconvenience at night to say the least   and no rear passenger lighting exists either   rear brake noise has been an issue for me personally from time to time as well   dependent upon whether or not you like it   you may or may not appreciate the exhaust engine noise   keep in mind this car   and especially the svt model   is designed with the performance enthusiast in mind   so the exhaust and engine are tuned accordingly   i personally love the growl from under the hood and from the exhaust overall   i think the v   contour s are great contender s in the market segment for which they compete   unfortunately for me but fortunate for others   the resale value is about average for a vehicle   which means you can get a really good price on slightly   read    years old   used models that have been well cared for   and even better deals on slightly older models br br  
819,1,  i recently spent a week with a   contour se on a   mile vacation   when i first picked up the car   i thought that it would be a total drag   i was pleasantly surprised   though   it is a very roomy car with all the features of a more expensive car   the ride quality is excellent and managed   miles per tank with a lot of highway driving at speeds of mph   mountainous driving requires manually shifting the automatic to get the most out of the     cyl engine   braking is sure with no fade   even after driving down a    grade for two miles the trunk is large and roomy enough to carry luggage for four   though billed as a   seater   four can sit comfortably   i have also driven v   contours in the past   however the   cylinder wil be more than adequate for most peoples needs br br  
820,1,  i just purchased a contour lx   it is a   model   and cost      i got a great deal considering their was only    miles on it   at first i was somewhat hesitent to test drive it because it was an automatic   and i usually hate automatics   but after just driving around the block   i was sold   i was amazed at what a great car you can get for so little   i looked at the honda accord and the toyota camary   but they were both overpriced   the contour was not only thousands cheaper   but i actually thought it drove nicer than the other two   the in dash cd player produced a sound that make the camary s radio look like a alarm clock in comparison   the only two complaints i have about the contour are small   one is that when you pop the trunk   it is a little heavy to lift   two is that the cup holders are positioned a little too far away from the driver   two inconviences yes   but not enough to deter a sensible buyer away from this great buy br br  
821,1,  this car is a gt premium   which has   horsepower as advertised   it is above the standard model   but it s about     more than the base model   my    recommendation   pay the extra money for the gt if you can   it s worth every penny and then some power acceleration   the acceleration in this car is quite phenomenal   i m more than happy with it   i ve added an american thunder cat back exhaust system to give it a really cool growling sound under open throttle   it has more horsepower because of the modification handling   i am very happy with this rear wheel powered vehicle   keep in mind this version of the vehicle has    performance tires   that surely improves handling significantly above the standard trim level   i ve hugged some tight curves with excellent grip on the road   on dry pavement   the handling is excellent   on wet pavement   care must be taken   spinning the tires is fairly easy during heavy rain   when accelerating onto a highway   beware of your usual high speeds when turning in wet rain   and leave plenty of space ahead for braking   breaking on dry pavement is very good   the   wheel anti lock disk brakes had been used in an emergency situation once   with maximum sustained pressure   and they lived up to their expectations   deceleration from    on a tight curve was better than expected   maintenance and upkeep   after     i am very happy   there s no major or minor problems to date   only time will tell   keeping the zinc yellow clean is more challenging   but it is well worth it   it s an outstanding color and gets noticed   i wonder how long my clutch is going to last   i surely make it suffer when i have fun with the car   it s doing good so far gas mileage   the gas mileage can average as low as    mpg during a week with above average traffic problems   i drive about    city     highway   and the average mpg per tank goes up to about     when there haven t been significant traffic problems on the commute   surprisingly   the cruising mpg   averaging about   for    miles   i received    mpg   that was a pleasant surprise   if you want to take advantage of the full power of with this car   your gas mileage will suffer gt   it s unavoidable   but it s never gone below    mpg for me comfort and interior   i m definitely used to the black leather seats and power everything   my dog loves the back seat   if i expected to have   or more adult passengers regularly   i would not purchase this vehicle   the rear view mirror is slightly obscured by the spoiler   and the side mirrors are slightly obscured by the body form in the back   it took some getting used to backing up into a parking spot   climate control is fine   and the   watt stereo is very clear at the maximum volume level   which is awesome   the ride is not overly uncomfortable for a sports car   i love the feel of control obtained from a sports car   as opposed to the floaty feel of comfort and luxury vehicles   the road needs to be felt when drying hard and fast price   the price i paid includes all taxes and fees      for the gt premium   that deal was through carsdirect   which   by the way   provided fine service and stuck to their price  
822,1,  the coupe in premium trim offers a lot for a low price   present   k rebates make the car a steal at about   k   philosophy moment   owning a proud american car takes a bit of self esteem   the camry conformity group will try to co depend you into their faceless society of stellar reliability   it is too dull a life for the expressive and passionate driver key attributes   horsepower    ft lbs of torque    r   tires   spd with traction control   wheel disc brakes with abs mach    disc cd changer   way power driver seat leather wrapped tilt steering wheel from the list above   it is clear you get a lot for your money in the coupe premium   further   the trim and badging are tasteful   subtle   and true to the images so familiar to most americans   handling is predictable and mild mannered in dry conditions   the goodyear eagle ls tires are surprisingly squeal resistant   this allows pushing the limits without attracting much attention   the brakes are decent   but not on par with s svt vehicles   they will stop the car   but are not made for the abuse a racing car might see the powertrain    l v with   speed   is flexible and torquey   as the rpms build past    so does a considerable amount of horsepower   the car will chirp the tires in second and third if you are not smooth with your shifts   the car is happy to cruise at   to   mph but is governed to   mph top speed   as a long term member of the   mph club   i can say that this is fast enough to pass     of the cars on the freeway for this type of vehicle   gas mileage is respectable ranging from   to   mpg on average   you can do even better on the highway with cruise control   the fit and finish is good   but some interior parts show uneven gaps between panels   there are no squeaks or rattles and the materials seems very robust   by and large   fit could improve but this year s shows does care about quality   the feel of the car is extremely solid   the gear shifter feels like it is part of the transmission   it is   and the engine seems composed and strong even with the throttle wide open to be objective   there are areas for improvement   wind noise is noticeable but not excessive   the back seat is not comfortable for adults   and   the rear live axle can occasionally make the back of the car feel a bit sloppy   these gripes withstanding   it is clear that no other car can match the s equipment   performance   and comfort levels at this price any questions   or   are you on your way to the dealer already   get a   it will revive your love for driving   or get a camry so it can steal your soul  
823,1,  i wanted a convertible for years   ever since i got my driver s license   when the   model came out   i thought it was the most beautiful car on wheels   that i could afford   of course   it had a powerful v engine   gorgeous design lines   leather interior   an automatic top so i wouldn t have to wrestle with folding and unfolding some unwieldy thing   it had a glass window in the back   with defroster   so it wouldn t get scratched like a plastic one   it also had a back seat   so i could pack friends or stuff   it was my dream car   i kept it cherry with weekly detailing in   i totalled my dream car because the combination of the huge   high performance   quot   tires   and the powerful v engine   although a blast to drive on dry pavement   were a disaster in wet weather   i was going below freeway speeds when i hydroplaned   spun out and hit the center divider twice   the air bags deployed perfectly   and although i had to get out and run from the dead car to avoid being hit by oncoming traffic   i was virtually uninjured   both the front and the back end of the car were smashed and twisted and virtually gone   but i had no trouble opening the door in a hurry   and not only did the airbags save my life   they prevented injury   i had had the car for four years and it didn t have a scratch   now it was gone   but i was alive i read later   in consumer reports   that many people have had similar experiences with the big tires big engine in wet weather   but that did not deter me from wanting to get another one   it was still the only car for me but the   model is ugly   its lines are no longer powerful   sleek and lovely   but sharp   angular   overly aggressive and masculine   i ve looked at it and looked at it and the design is just repulsive   it s still a   it s still a great car   but it can not compare to the look of my    i am dismayed that the designers at are again on the downhill slide with the   in my opinion   the of the   s and   s was one sad looking underdeveloped machine   a far cry from the hot   innovative little pony car of its beginning   i hope that the of the new millennium will not share that fate   go back to the drawing board   guys    and make it beautiful again   you can make it powerful and hot looking without making it look like a shark   start with your    models   i still haven t bought a new car   and the money s burning a hole in my pocket   and i m itchin to feel again the way that car made me feel br br  
824,1,  this was the first new car i ever purchased   it was my dream car   my     door coupe was forest green with saddle   tan   interior   the   cylinder    liter    horsepower engine was all the power i needed   sure i would have liked to have had a bigger   beefier engine   but did i need it   no   i have the two speeding tickets to prove it i only had my car a couple weeks and we decided to take it on a   quot road trip quot   up to the mountains   to show it off to my parents   it handled like a dream   with   passengers that engine pulled us right up the sierra nevada highways   passing people left and right it was a great commute car   with good gas mileage   i could go a week   traveling   round trip miles a day   on one tank of gas   the only draw back for this car was the comfort level for long trips   as long as you were driving it was fine   but the passengers were not as comfy   the head rest on the front seats were to far back to recline and enjoy the ride   the back seat area was small   only a petite woman could sit back there comfortably for any long period of time we traded in my for a   explorer when my due date approached   it was going to be too difficult to get a child in and out of the back seat   let alone all the   quot stuff quot   that goes with one in the trunk area   i really miss my car   and breathe a sigh of regret every time i see one on the road   hopefully one day in the future we can get another one   i will bet my daughter would love one when she starts driving fourteen more years   wonder if i can wait br br  
825,1,  wanna get hold of a fun   fast car   that s fairly good on gas   has a great reputation as an american classic   and holds up well over a five year period   then the   is for you i bought my in dec     one year after the re designed   stangs came out   my little champ is a basic model   v     l engine   that still performs like the day i brought it home from the stable   it gets good gas mileage    city   hwy   has great suspension   corners awesome   and has been relatively trouble free   i ve recently turned    miles by october     a few parts that i ve replaced include tie rod ends   struts   serpentine belt   and tune up parts   just did that myself about   months ago   and   new tires last year   other then regular oil changes   there have been no major corrections needed for my   the engine is top notch   the transmission excellent   a none worse for wear under carriage   relatively rust free exhaust system   and good body still makes for a beautiful ride in this classic car a few cons include limited cab space   i wouldn t recommend this car to people over    quot    i m    quot   and the back seat is very cramped   only good for little kids   really   also   due to the tight suspension   potholes can easily mess up the wheel alignment   i ve corrected this twice in five years     
826,1,  just about   years ago   i re entered that oh so wonderful market of used car searching   having driven a   bonneville for the last   years of my life   i was ready for something a little sportier   because of insurance   mustangs   eclipses   and cameros were instantly out of the question   at the time   power didn t matter to me as much as looks   finally   i stumbled upon the car that would soon become mine   through the good times and the bad   it was indeed a   probe p b appearence   i outside   from the start   this was without a doubt the factor that sold me from the beginning   it s styling is amazingly intricate   and for it s day in age   seemed much more aerodynamic then most of the running competitors   while it didn t offer the ground effects or better looking rear bumper then the gt model   it did still sport the same front bumper   however   it disappointingly did not come with premium rims   or even alloy rims at that   it s hubcaps were very loosely attached to    black steelies   and looked like one of the worst designed i d ever seen   its taillight brakelight display pattern was clear   bright   and consisted of a rd brake light on the upper border of the hatch window   pop up headlights were extremely smooth looking at the time   but because of maintenance   became more of a nuisance over a good period of time   it also sported a factory spoiler   which helped to complete the car s small   compact design   the trunk helps to tally up yet another plus for the probe   offering alot of space to store move stuff   the back seats could be put down to allow for more room   i was once able to fit a whole   speed bike in the back end with no problem at all   and room to spare i inside   on the inside   it seemed extremely roomy   however   that was before i ever tried to get into the back   which almost didn t even exist because of its tight quarters   the upholstery was made of a cheap looking plastic   and appeared to snap into place everywhere   that didn t exactly thrill me   but it was going to have to work   the seats   also available in leather   were made of cloth   and provided individual bucket style seating   they were very comfortable   but after a few long trips   i found them to be a little odd in shape and hard on your neck   mostly because there is no separate headrest to be pulled up or down   it came factory with a cheap tape deck   which i yanked out within weeks of having the car   it s wiring was easily noted   and color coated   however   unless you have a work manual telling what you what is what   that doesn t really help much   another huge plus of the car was its overall visibility from the inside   since it is a hatchback   it s comprised of many good sized windows   because of this small factor   backing up and maneuvering on the road was made simpler and more worry free   in my opinion   the driving display was seemingly a little plain   but has everything that you could need to know while operating the car   consisting of mph   rpm   oil level   engine temp   gas   and battery   i found that it got the job done   at night   the display was seemingly a little dark   and only emits but a small green glow   which can be adjusted by the intensity knob   its single overhead dome light doesn t create much light in pitch black instances   but was sufficient enough for the time being i engine bay   under the hood   i found there to be alot more open space then i was expecting   wiring however was kinda messy   with tons of stray wires running every which way   and appearing in no logical order or pattern   the engine crankcase was based almost directly in the center of the engine bay   and seemed well proportioned for a   cylinder   when changing the oil   i immediately discovered that the oil filter was located in a horriable place   to reach it   you must run your arm almost   feet deep in the engine bay   from the bottom up   and this included sliding your arm by the exhaust manifold and piping   bad idea   because of its extremely high temperatures   you must let the cat sit on ramps for almost    hours before you even dare stick your arm up by it   while on the topic of heat   the car s engine tends to run extremely hot   while the temperature gauge reads that it s in normal range   it is a very hot engine   and must be allowed to cool down for a good amount of time before working on     b engine stats    the standard engine in the   probe is a    liter    valve dohc inline   cylinder   while the car is manufactured under s name   the engine itself   and most of it s components and counterparts are actually produced by mazda   when i first got my probe   it purred so quiet that you could hardly hear it running   no sudden drops in rpms were present   nor spark or engine knock   now   about   years after it was purchased   k miles at time   i ve got k on her   and she s still running smoothly   some spark knock has occurred   but is quieted by using plus    octane   grade gasoline   under my experience   the engine is extremely reliable   and has yet to leave me stranded or screaming at my car at the flywheel   it produces   horsepower   while it is closer to about   horsepower at the wheel   redlining at   rpm   it s apparent that it s not a engine   my specific model was a manual transmission   so i found it to be awfully peppy off the line   i also found the engine to be extremely weak and it tended to struggle on just about any hard acceleration applied below the   rpm line   once you got to about   to   rpm is where the power band begins to kick in   and is short lived to about   rpm   running the air conditioner takes an extremely dampening toll on horsepower   and appears to make the entire car s operating performance more sluggish   while this car does produce a good amount of horsepower and pull for a   cylinder   it is by no means a powerhouse   if you re looking for that   it might be wise to start elsewhere   if you ve got your hopes set on a probe   i might suggest looking into it s more expensive and step up gt model   sporting a   horsepower    valve quad cam v   p b performance ride quality    as for road stats   completely stock   my probe was running about around a       mph in the    s recorded road test records slightly better results   but this is about what you would expect from a   year old car   the car s governor kicks in at   mph   at right about   rpm   braking was decently quick   responsive and smooth   however   my car was not equipped with the optional abs   anti lock brake system   so i m not really able to comment on that aspect   turning and cornering was yet another strong point for the car   making it extremely maneuverable   as mentioned previously   teamed up with its excellent level of visibility   it makes for a very easy and effortless driving experience when weaving in and out of traffic   however   because the large amount of glass   fogging of the windows can start to become a problem   especially during the wintertime   you may find yourself waiting   and waiting   and waiting even longer   just for your windows to defog when it comes to gas mileage   the probe does put forth an extremely good effort   stats for the car read   in town   and   on the highway   my person findings have been must better   on the average   i ll normally get about   miles in town   and almost a whopping   mpg on the highway   cruising on the highway creates a very comfortable and smooth ride   ranging the smoothest from   to   mph   however   another negative you that may very well hear from multiple probe owners is the infamous rattling sound coming mostly from the back hatch area   while other rattles are present   the most obvious by far would be from the back   i ve tried multiple times to find out exactly what it is that caused this   and have yet to come up with an answer   also   while on rattles   the windows start to come into play   since they are rimless windows   they don t have a base   or track that they follow when rolled down   because of this   even when rolled all the way down   they tend to rattle inside the door   this can be fixed   but requires taking the door apart to apply   buffers   along the windows path p b options    the   probe   like any other car   could come fully loaded   or bare to the bone   some of the available options are as follows   power seats   power windows   power door locks   power mirrors   powered sunroof   abs   anti lock braking system    wheel disk brakes   premium sound system w equalizer   spoiler   premium wheels   or alloys   rear window wiper   ground effects   side airbags   keyless entry   cruise control   fog lights   leather seats   sports suspension and intermittent wipers if fog lights were not included on your model but are desired   you will be happy to find that the harnesses for it s wiring was still ran through the car   making it easy to plug the factory fog lights button up to custom fog lights   swapping out the factory tape cd tuner is made very simple because of its economy standard sized opening   which requires no special harnesses   many of the other options can be added as well   rather it be by use of aftermarket parts   or even managing to find order original factory parts from    prices    at the time i bought my probe   you could find most of the   models ranging anywhere between    to    depending on mileage   shape   and overall condition   however   since then   there has apparently been a drop in the marketing price   and the prices have dropped through the floor   if you keep your eyes peeled   you could pick up a great steal for right around      however   when taking in account of the car   you had best put a good amount of money aside   because this car has been known for it s expensive repairs p b repairs    within months of owning the car   i was sadly introduced to the number one gripe of owning a probe   prices tend to be    times as much as they would be on say a taurus   or escort   reason for this would most likely be because when the probe came out   it had a very rare set of tools that were needed to work on it   since it s a mazda hybrid   it was a total mess when it came to trying to using tools for only fords   or only for mazdas   also   it s not exactly considered a plus that this car was discontinued   much less that the   model was the   farewell   year model   since   was the last year the probe was produced   in the us   many loose ends and problems were left unsolved and fixed   it is because of this reason that even dealerships aren t able to answer some of the problems that tend to occur p b overview    after all is said and done   it all comes down to personal preference and choice   would your money be best invested in this mazda discontinued hybrid   or spent it elsewhere   well   that s really for you to decide   in my personal opinion   i am planning on sticking with probe until it s end   however   if you are looking to a probe   don t make the same mistake i did   maybe the   cylinder model is perfect for you   and gas mileage means much more then performance   but if you re in the run for more power and somewhat upgraded or better styling   you might wanna slip into a gt   it obviously would prove to be much quicker and yield more power in about every aspect   but when it all comes down to   i can t completely rip on the probe too much   because it has got me from here to there with some style   and has never left me stranded   while repairs can range from pricey to ridiculous   the car itself is almost more of a mystery then anything   the final standing question would be if you re willing to give this enigma a chance  
827,1,  my wife bought this car   years ago   jan    and we use this car as our   around town   car   other than tires   oil and brakes we have never had this car in the shop   this car has held up through long road trips   cramming with luggage and a couple of small fender benders we like this car because of its looks as well as its design the controls are all in easy reach of the driver and passenger   we have the   speed   which for a car in this price range   is surprisingly agile the car could use bigger tires and wheels to help it stick to the road   but the suspension is good and firm in most turns   we have the   cyl engine   which is not the most powerfull engine   if you like this car but want power   get the   gt the engine is a high revving engine that most people can have some fun with   all in all a good car for the money   would be suitable for a teenager    the gas mileage is great   the car is reliable and it has dual air bags  
828,1,  this   probe is a sporty and spunky little car   it is reliable and always ready to run   my   probe has   miles on it to date   i have had very little trouble with the engine   it blew a timing belt but when replaced it ran great   this problem was my fault   as i was aware that timing belts should be changed periodically the   has quick pick up with the turbo engine and it gets in and out of traffic with little trouble   the paint has held up very well for an eleven year old car   it is fun to drive but watch out for tickets   it gets good gas mileage even at this late stage   it continues to get   miles to the gallon and the spark plugs have not been changed in   years   the air conditioner has been the only problem and that is because there no protection in the grille   it is very easy to get a rock in the condenser   this can be eliminated by putting in a screen to protect the condenser   i would rather have this little stick shift model then a new one   i believe the   probe will be considered a classic in later years and i am going to hang on to this one   this is the car for someone who likes the sporty look likes the feel of a car   is interested in reliability and value and may want to keep it for future appreciation     
829,1,  my husband recently traded our   b mazda for a   door v xlt wd   we loved the mazda but it was getting lots of miles on it and wanted something new   the mazda and are the same vehicle basically and we knew we had good luck with the mazda for years the controls are exactly the same   and i mean exactly   this is fine since everything is laid out well and is good quality   several things have changed on the inside like the steering wheel is a little thicker which is more comfortable   this truck has   doors   but not full size doors that make you lose bed space   they make it easier to store things behind the seat as well as being easier for passengers to get into the back   the back is still not the most comfortable spacious ride   but it s okay for short trips   i personally don t like the seats sitting sideways in the back as it can make you feel sick on twisty roads   but we don t use them much we had one bold break and one loosen frequently on the armrest in the mazda   they have since added bracing on both sides of the armrest which makes it much more sturdy   there is also an airbag turn off switch for when you need to have children ride up front   he got the single cd stereo which has very good sound and easy to read buttons the biggest and best change is the engine   it s the same size but more hp with more get up and go   it s also geared differently   manual   where you can be in a higher gear at a lower speed which has been a good thing with all of the snow and ice we ve had   the wd is great and can take you anywhere you want to go   it rides like a truck because it is one   but the ride in the new one is much tighter and takes the bumps a whole lot better one thing i don t like is the programmed keys   they are    plus    for programming if you have them do it   we bought   extra keys and programmed our own but it was pretty scary because we didn t want to mess it up and have to have it towed   miles to the dealer   it was pretty easy though   it s supposed to make it harder for thieves and is considered an alarm system it s a good truck that has been relatively unchanged for many years which shows that it is an idea that works no new trucks seem to come with a bedliner and i m quite sure why seeing how expensive the trucks are and they save the paint   we got a bedliner installed by them and it s very nice br br  
830,1,  i love it   my truck has a great look and definitely turns heads   i trade in a   explorer sport x   i have to tell you that i already miss the full back seat my two daughters like riding in the back but i can tell the novelty will soon wear off   the explorer had more power and the turning radius was much better   however at   miles the gas mileage was horrible i went to the dealership with the intention of buying a new explorer   however   the    sticker sent me looking for something cheaper   i looked at the new sport and sport track but like it s big sister the price with options put it near k   too much for a car in my opinion   i immediatly noticed the truck on the showroom floor   it looked very tough and extremely sporty   be advised i am a   yo white collar professional not an   yo looking to buy his first truck the salesman was steering me toward the new escape yuk   the escape is boring inside and out   i kept going back to the   after a long solo test drive i was sold   the wind noise is average   the nissan i test drove was much worse   take offs from traffic lights are more than adequate   the internal controls are easy to reach and attractive   i opted for the   disc in dash cd player   it reacts a little to slow for my taste but the sound is clear it makes highway driving fun   i play music loud and can not hear anything going on outside the truck   i especially like the way increased the s height   it sits at the same level as the explorer overall i recommend the extended cab x    v   it handles well and does great off road   the stylish improvements and interior do a great justice to this truck   if you are in the market for a small suv or pick up try this out in your search   you will not be disappointed   it matched the foreign competition in every way except was typically    thousand dollars cheaper   good luck  
831,1,  real truck people know who s got it in the compact class   most would agree   nobody but nobody   can touch s   although the japanese may have an advantage in car sales they remain on the outside looking in when it comes to trucks   gm has never been a serious contender with the s   and is only starting to make some inroads with the dakota   quite simply   none match the build quality puts into the for instance   i drove my last   a   wd for   years before recently upgrading to a slightly used     x supercab edge   during my ownership covering    miles i replaced one set of brakes and shocks   did one tune up   replaced a leaky valve cover gasket   several mufflers   two batteries and a water pump   basically just routine maintenance   quite a record for any vehicle   especially one that cost just      for those of you that may not know   the edge series comes with fewer goodies than the top of the line xlt   it lacks some of the finer things you d consider indispensable in an automobile such as tilt   power windows and locks   keyless entry etc   however this model was exactly what i was looking for as it contains a hose me out interior   the extra room the   door cab offers is great for hauling around my constant companion   a german shepherd named barney   barney seems to have   times more hair than any dog his size would require   most of which he d leave behind where it would stick fast to the seats and carpeting of the previous truck   the edge with its vinyl floor and seats   is one heck of a lot easier to vacuum and keep clean   and after all   this is a truck   not the family go to sunday meeting luxury vehicle having said that i must admit i was somewhat disappointed with our test drive of this vehicle   for one thing there was more engine noise and a much choppier ride than in my far older   wheel drive truck   the difference was very noticeable   so much so   we went home without purchasing the truck   much to the chagrin of our sales person i guess we just weren t prepared for the difference you ll find between the   wheel version and its bigger   at least taller   x brother   after some discussion my wife and i decided even though we preferred the   wheel suspension   a x would be better suited to our current needs   point being if you don t live in snow country   unless you re into status that is   you ll be a lot more comfortable in a   wheel model   here you ll find easier entry   since it s lower to the ground   in addition to a much softer ride of course serious truck lovers wouldn t consider anything but a x   why because they re macho   they just look bigger and meaner with their taller stance and huge tires   often owning a x is all about image   not necessarily need   maybe some of that was true with us too as the edge x is one mean looking vehicle   it just says   drive me   when sitting in our garage i consider the    v   sightly undersized   especially since the truck is rated to haul up to    lbs   can t help but wonder where they got that number   must have known that because newer models come with the     a   hp boost   as standard equipment   although the smaller engine is adequate for most needs and probably does better at the pumps   gas mileage is in the    range   not exactly outstanding the fun to drive aspect is hard to measure   ride is toward the harsh side   but the truck handles incredibly well and doesn t feel the least bit tippy unlike many suv s   seats are very comfortable   wind noise is minimal   i have noticed some creaking noises   undoubtedly attributable to the   door design that lacks the stabilizing nature of a center post   as noted earlier the vinyl interior of the edge makes cleanup a breeze   nevertheless it does make one wonder why had to pad the seat backs with a velcro like cloth that nearly defeats the clean ability feature for dog lovers   the is literally bullet proof from a mechanical standpoint   combine that with its good looks   rugged suspension   right size   flexible utility and fun to drive aspect   you have one heck of vehicle   it can haul wood   cruise effortlessly on the highway or carry campers through some of the worst terrain without taking a deep breath   and it retains its value better than    of all the other vehicles on the road   no wonder it s the number one selling compact truck   it sure gets my vote  
832,1,  we live on a farm and purchased a big truck in order to pull a horse trailer to transport our horses   cows and or sheep as well as haul feed for them   i buy a ton at a time   we also needed it to pull a car trailer for our antique and classic car collection   at first i was intimidated by this monster of a truck   being a small woman   but once you get used to it i think anyone would enjoy driving this truck   it has a lot of power and rides very smooth   it handles very nice and makes you sit up so tall you can t help but to feel powerful   ours has a v   in it and i wouldn t want anything less   i really like the power br br  
833,1,  we recently purchased a new f   super crew for the reason that we wanted a truck   we looked at the ram   the dakota   and the   the f   was the most comfortable and economically sized   when we decided to test drive   the ride was smooth and quiet   all controls were perfectly situated for an easy ride   that was when we decided that the f   was what we wanted   since then   i have been more than happy with our purchase   we have taken it with us on long road trips and even had to sleep in it which made for an accurate night of sleep   i was impressed with the comfort i felt that the f   had made during the long drive   i highly recommend this truck  
834,1,  i own a   two tone   north woods limited edition what s so limited bout it   i don t really know   its a   liter   banger w   a stick   five overdrive   standard cab   long bed   though i wish it was the otherway around   ext   cab   short box   not enough leg room   and it doesn t have tilt   i heed you this   do nt get a that doesn t have tilt steering   thou can be dealt w   but gets frustratting on long trips   overall seating is ahh well i guess comfortable for short rides but w   standard cab your bound to feel confined after an hour or longer trip   trust me i know   and i m not that tall either   at    quot   my knees start to bother me on long hauls   due to not so perfect seating arrangment   no   its not the clutch either   that i would add is very controled and perfectly calibrated   not to hard or to mushy   just right feel   and very strong   even after one hell of a rigorois beating of tryin to sport the damn thing and revin up the r s to a point of redline and popping the clutch numerios times if i may add too   even after k miles   feels just the same as new   exactly the same   actually better due to break in   brakes extremely well even though only has front anti lock   chassis settles very well and keeps comepletely controlled under exteme hard braking   manueverabititly well   very well built   no problems at all stong frame that can take much streess when pushed hard   can handle heavy loads very well   obvios engine lag and clutch stress but never seems to be a problem   ya got ta consider   its only a   and its not built for speed or much power either   but is indeed an all around very trustworthly truck   interior wise again    was the year that transferd over to the more streamlined sexy looking interior all rounded off and flashier looking   not enough elbow room left side      door side   seats pushed to close to door to make more room between seats   don t like that   good visibility for instumentation   very easy to use and explanatory fuctions make truck easy to drive   like the rear cargo light   that isn t available on the s    so that s a plus for   but would like the option to have it on a separate swith   they come on w   the interior when turning on interior light which isn t to bad thou   biggest disapointment   again the leg room on standard cab   the truck as a whole isn t all that aerodynamically designed or looking   but there isn t much road noise anyhow   long bed accomates enough space   thou wish bed was just at least a bit deeper   rear tailgate good weight   not to heavy   and not to light to bounce around on freeway when open either   good overall road site    though having tilt would allow more over the hood   has great lighting for night driving   thou one thing i do nt like about fords new design of the wind shield wiper blade speed is that everytime you use the blinker   you can t help but to hit it and accidently change it   it being located right on the outside of the blinker lever   that s where i give props to chevy   having the dial in the middle of the lever      with stick isn t all that bad w   no load   but can t sustain high speed cruise over    for the life of it   winter months w   out any weight in the back totally suck here in mi w   all the snow we get   if you live in a snow climate   i d strongly advise wd   it looks better for the trucks anyways   the big tires   high stance   its speaks    banger s good on gas   but if you crave power   then its the    that you need w   out a doubt   its a good starter truck   that s really all to it anyquestions feel free to e mail at tama hotmail br br  
835,1,  we went to a dealership where a friend worked   so we knew that we wouldn t be   quot taken quot   for a ride   and we looked and looked   wanting an extended cab   x pickup with air conditioning   but in our price range the extended cab was out of the question   amp   hard to find   so we ended up with a   x pickup with a c and cruise control   it had k miles on it when we got it in    amp   it has been great to us   it has bucket seats with a little   quot bench quot   type seat between them so that our daughter can sit in the middle   it drives very nicely   amp   isn t all that bad on the gas mileage   we haven t had to use the x feature that often   but when we have it has met or exceeded our expectations all the time   one thing i really like about the   model is that the body style is so similar to the current style that many times people think our truck is new   kind of nice that hasn t changed the body style much over the last few years we haven t put that many miles on the truck in the   years we have had it   since it is our second vehicle   but we hope that will help preserve the value of the vehicle     
836,1,  my    is a great truck to own   it has over    miles on it   is running great   and has had no major repairs or service done on it other than regularly scheduled tune ups and replacing the tires   although hard core off roaders might prefer the wd model   unless you live in the outback the wd is much more practical and economical   the engine is a large straight   cylinder with decent power and it shows no signs of needing any repairs any time soon   it has had no problems towing small camping trailers or being heavily loaded with items like pianos and couches when i helped my uncle and aunt move   and so it s a very practical truck to have   plus   it s not as large and unwieldy as most other pickups that are a pain to park or that you would worry a lot about in underground parking   i enjoy driving it   but i try to keep too many people from finding out that i own it or i end up having to help people move all the time   i guess that just comes with the territory in owning a pickup truck my only complaints are    it could use a little more power for the big hills i live in a mountainous area so it would be nice to still be able to accelerate up those steep hills rather than just maintaining my speed   but like i said   it has decent power     i wouldn t mind a little more passenger space at the expense of a little cargo room   but then again   i m     so it should be fine for most people as far as towing and hauling   this truck actually rides better when it s loaded down   if you do want the extra power   at the expense of a little gas mileage   go for the v model rather than the   cylinder   it just depends on your needs preferences  
837,1,  i ve had my    since    i bought it for    and consider it a great investment   i m a contractor on the side   a salesman full time   one of the first rules of business is to keep expenses down and profits up   sales have been slower lately but are building up again   i stay busy doing jobs smaller than most guys take on but no matter the economy i cringe at the thought of covering a new truck payment every month   why pay someone else money i made   let s see   buy new truck and throw money away   i do electrical   plumbing   dry walling   tile work and more   this truck has been great for all of it   tax deduction   i ve two great tax deductions i get to tuck into bed at night when i m not out on a job late   then i d also rather spend some time with my tax deductions   girl in   and boy in    rather than running ragged all the time   i ve got about    miles on this little critter and figure i ll drive it until it falls apart around me   one day i ll close the door and the thing will disintegrate into a cloud of dust   i ll rummage through it and pick out my tools   i do believe the next work truck will be a van   though   but   off topic one of the first things i had to do was have the exhaust system replaced      for the whole thing   another    for a topper    i was ready to go to work and not letting the entire neighborhood when i came    went this never was a beautiful truck   it was originally dark brown with a tan interior   but now the rust has given it a two tone color scheme   the only body panel that has not been eaten away at least partially by rust is the hood   all the wheel wells are slowly expanding   the right pivot point for the end gate has fallen off   i found it and have it on a shelf in the garage   believe it or not   i d rather drive this than a new truck   i never worry about door dings in the parking lot at lowe s menard s home depot   i cut shingles on the hood and use the side panels to knock concrete out of my mixing trough   why   because i can    it s convenient   nothing i do to this truck will reduce its value at all because it is far from the showroom nor has this truck ever been considered powerful   the   l engine is sufficient to keep it moving with traffic   but not to pull anything large and continue to do so   i ve driven from des moines to chicago with it to do a basement finish for my brother in law and even in chicago traffic i was able to hold my own   i m never   chosen   at stop lights but people give me room when i signal i m changing lanes   i think other drivers see the rust and are afraid that if they get too close it ll jump onto their car   too   a pox on ye   fine once when i rented a lift and was backing it into position up a driveway   the clutch began smoking   a lot   it    the clutch not the smoke    lasted another year or so until i could barely make it up my own driveway   so   i dropped the transmission    with someone who knew what they were doing    and replaced the clutch for about     the mechanic who does the work on my car quoted me about     i hate paying retail   the only issue i ve had with the interior noise level    it s tolerable even at interstate speeds    was on that trip to chicago   i turn the radio up to cover the engine noise   even though i say it is tolerable   that doesn t mean you can hold conversation with a passenger   i d also noted a great deal of wind noise from the passenger door and could see daylight through the top seal   so   at the next rest area i stopped and tweaked the door a bit   it wasn t quite enough   so at the next exit i tweaked it again   harder   that tightened the door to the point that it s difficult to open   but   the wind noise is gone   i like the bench seat   it really is comfortable   compared to the seats in my sales car    taurus   it is very comfortable   on the longer trips it doesn t limit you with bolsters or even attempt to cradle you   it just supports you and does this job very well   i keep my cordless drill    sawsall in the space behind the seat   i ve also mounted a first aid kit behind my head over the seat   it hangs down over the window but doesn t obstruct the view   since the seat doesn t have whiplash protection   the first aid kit has a dual use   perhaps someone will encourage me to purchase a newer vehicle someday by rear ending this truck   it wouldn t take much so i hope they re gentle the rear view mirror sought new employment one day out of the blue   it came groveling back from under the seat and now sits close to the end gate pivot in the garage   the view out the back is limited by stuff in the topper anyway   i ve quite a lot of tools neatly boxed in those cheap   plastic   gallon bins   they keep the tools out of sight and small parts easy to find   i ve tested the payload capacity a few times too many   the tires have been the only suspension on the rear at least a couple of times    once with a too large load of shingles and the second with a way too heavy tree trunk   a couple of other times since then i ve had the rear bumper drag on the way out the driveway   it doesn t take as much as it used to to do that   the right front brake hangs up once in a while   i believe i need new calipers but don t feel like dropping the money into the truck and don t have the time to spare anyway   i just avoid using the parking brake and things work fine   the windshield is cracked from a large extension ladder being strapped to the roof of the truck   i just laid it over the top of the topper and roof of the truck and strapped it down in the front and back   it caused a bit of stress on the roof and some cracks developed   iowa doesn t have laws concerning cracked windshields so i ll let it go until it becomes a problem   i carry the ladder very rarely as it looks like a hook    ladder truck coming down the road   well   perhaps more like a tight contractor who won t spring for a ladder rack the windshield wipers don t like to be too cold   if the day is under freezing they need some time for the engine to warm them up a bit   not a huge deal   most old trucks have a quirk or two   this one just has a dozen or so   a more annoying thing is that when the humidity is high or especially if there s been heavy dew   the truck is very reluctant to start   i ve replaced the starter twice   the first time was because it was worn out   the second time because a damaged flywheel was actually the culprit the first time   the second time i opted for the biggest starter that would fit in there   teamed with an oversized battery what s   reluctant   for me may be   not at all   for someone else   i don t know   i ve also noted a lot of leaves end up in my vents   then   occasionally the blower shreds them fine enough that they blow out but normally i need to dig them out   i gave up and tore the vent louvers off the dash   now the leaves just blow whole out of the chute while i m driving down the road   just wait until this winter when the heater really gets going   picture flaming leaves   anyway   the vent louvers have joined the collection on the shelf in the garage this may be related to the leaf thing   but when it rains i ve noticed that the floor on the passenger s side is wet   i just make certain anything that i put on the floor isn t going to be damaged by moisture   copper fittings    small bins of screws   i ve had a couple of cardboard boxes disintegrate with a couple of pounds of screws in them before i began to watch what i keep there   the bed has taken a great deal of abuse but looks pretty good   i found a bed mat in a garage i was working on one time that a previous owner had left   it keeps those plastic bins from sliding around as much   it s also a bit more comfortable than the metal when crawling up to reach the bin with the power tools    that s why i d like to go to a van when this truck gives up the ghost the radiator or a hose has developed a small leak   i m hoping it s a hose or clamps myself   three cans of stop leak and it slowed down a bit more   reflecting upon that it s probably the water pump   i notice this leak better in the winter as when the water mix gets too low in the radiator it doesn t reach the heater core and the cabin blower blows cold air   otherwise the heater works great   you could almost scald tender skin on the hottest setting   i m not certain what tender skin you re thinking of   no a c but i grew up without a c and am generally fine without it when dressed in grubby clothes   on really bad days i just knock off early   you can t work on a roof or in an attic when it s that hot anyway and if you re in an a c controlled house or a basement then you re golden    so to speak anyway   working in the dark i get rather pasty i think the carpeting is after market   at least it looks like it   not very well fitted either   heck for    you think you d get something a bit better   eh   the shifter knob for the five speed transmission has fallen off a few times   no doubt from that blistering acceleration   no threading on the lever or in the knob so i wrapped electrical tape around the lever and pounded the knob onto it   no problem   many items on this truck seem ready to jump ship   i m not certain why   electrical tape fixes many things   not as well as duct tape   but i m more of an electrician   not a heating    air guy the dash holds note pads   gloves and assorted ends well   the blowers also contribute an odd leaf or two   there s a nice bin above the glove that is at least as big as the glove box itself and that is great for the smaller things i don t need in my pouches but need to have along   the glove box is the tip out variety and doesn t hold much   it also doesn t always want to stay closed   on harder bumps it will fall open and try to steal items from the bin above it   it takes two or more tries to get it to stay closed again   even while closed it looks like it s threatening to open   a cautionary glance stops it but it seems to be muttering to itself even as it stays closed   insurance and licensing are almost silly     per year for registration     per year for decent insurance coverage   again   one of the first rules of business is to keep expenses down and profits up   this truck does it well when i was an employee   we had most everything delivered   this truck was more than sufficient   now that i work on my own   i ve learned that i personally need something that can carry a bit more   a    ton or one ton van would be right   would i recommend this to you   i guess you need to evaluate what you re going to use it for and what you re willing to put up with   i m out to impress exactly no one   now   if you need more cargo room   more tonnage   towing power i d certainly get something else   if you want a good solid truck to occasionally take a new bed home for yourself or your neighbors   then this truck is plenty   you won t catch too many new truck owners hauling dirt or garden manure in their new truck   i ve no qualms the decision is   of course   up to you  
838,1,  my    finally gave up the ghost at the most inopportune time   right before my spring break trip to paris   not about to lose the second trip of a lifetime   see my review of belfast for the first   i scoped the eiffel tower before coming back and dealing with reality   fortunately   my dealer pulled a mess of strings   and   ta da   i was driving home from houston   another long story   in my new   of course   you ll run your usual gamut of   anagram for fix or repair daily   putdowns   but the   yep   even the recently deceased   has always been an old reliable for me   and there was just something about the that made me want to go for it   i wouldn t open a hauling with one   but other than that   this baby will tote whatever you like down the highway without the excessive fishtailing you see in similar economy pickups   it s got about six feet of bedroom that will allow you to flag any oversized loads comfortably without expecting a pork wagon to pull you over   as i said   it also handles well enough   but don t get happy and make any fancy moves out there or you ll be picking junk up off the road as a result   inside the cab is a foldaway armrest which acts as an extra stash for cd s   your tape player   guns or whatever   it s a nice place to prop your elbow when alone   and will gladly make room for your special someone to cuddle up   the cushy seats also pull back enough to take advantage of what you will find to be an unreal amount of space   hey   i fit my briefcase   a full semester of textbooks   a crowbar   a six pack of hard lemonade   baseball caps and dozens of assorted papers back there so you couldn t even see it   i don t know if those seats are gon na take that kind of abuse in    but i won t bet against it   the vinyl steering wheel is starting to wear a bit   but the upholstery is standing up well   and the seats look like they re ready to go quite a few rounds it comes with a cool speaker system   and for a few bucks your car stereo dealer should be able to hook up something that ll make your cab come alive   also   it s got a hideaway spare and jack that hasn t seen the light of day   caution   this baby came with squeaky firestone radials that haven t popped yet   but i m planning to swap them someday real soon and so should you all in all   this is a good looking   dependable little ride that will haul your stuff around smoothly for some time to come   keep your oil changed regularly   drop a few bucks for upholstery cleaning once in a while   and the will reward you with reliable performance and low maintenance that you will long appreciate  
839,1,  i m semi retired and about to retire shortly so i wanted to find a vehicle that would serve my needs   i decided to buy my   xlt lwb after i looked at the competition   my desire was to get a truck to haul lumber home for special projects the lwb is    long   carry my big rc model airplanes to from the field   drive something that was economical to run   my    ltr   cyl w   automatic   amp   overdrive gets mpg   the seating room is better then my old   chevy c pu i sold a few years ago   i am overweight and felt that i might have to get one with a supercab but the regular cab fits me just fine   it rides just fine with a load of lumber but is a bit bouncy   as they all are   on poor roads   the only option i added was a tarp cover that fits over the bed and rests on   arched aluminum rails to allow rain to run off my truck also is helpful on trips from the nursery with loads of mulch   lots of plants or moving a few appliances for neighbors this is not a truck to pull a big boat or trailer nor does it have the hp or torque to carry big loads like a full size truck but it works just fine   like any pickup caution must be used when driving in snow ice   i looked at trucks from all the manufacturers and had   basic needs   good milage and something i would enjoy driving   i found both in this truck and recommend it to any one going on a fixed income and yet wants to have a certain amount of flexability in their vehicle br br  
840,1,  my boyfriend owns a   and he loves it   he generally has bad luck with cars   and after his second car   a   broke down   he decided it was time for a new car   i begged him to purchase a truck   because i think they are great   when he pulled up in his green truck   i fell in love   it is so nice   it has a nice sized bed and is perfect for those people who do not need a full sized car or a huge truck   it has nice pick up and is pretty fast   it has never given him any problems   it handles good in the rain or snow   this is a perfect truck for teens and people without families or people with one child   i said that this truck is very roomy   even in back   because there is no option that says    quot very roomy   no back seat quot     
841,1,  i bought my    back in dec of    right off the showroom floor   it was just a bit above factory standard   amp   cobalt blue   my fav   color   i was on leave from my air force technical training course and was about to be shipped off to offutt afb   i needed a truck that could handle a   mile trip without breaking this little airman s wallet     here s some requested information about the engine     liter    h p    cylinder as i stated earlier the truck was cobalt blue   here s the rest of the info   xlt    wheel drive    speed manual transmission    cylinder   standard sound system   all said and done it cost me         financing   over   years   i had this truck until    when i upgraded to an f    during that time i had only one thing that went wrong   the cellenoid sp   freaked out twice and i had to jump the posts to get the truck to turn over   i also had two factory recalls   recall    a bad seal in the drivers door that might cause the door to open suddenly if water seeped in and froze   recall    a faulty oil pump   i loved this truck   it was small enough that it was able to get   mpg on the highway and wasn t a nightmare to park   while still being big enough to haul around things like queen size mattresses with no problem   this truck is a great   quot first truck quot   and is also great for people who need a truck that gets great gas mileage   my one complaint about the   and trucks in general   is the location of the spare   i had a flat once and i had to drag myself under the truck to get the spare off   it should be a bit easier than that br br  
842,1,  every family needs a truck at one point or another   my family has personally retired four trucks in the last   years   when shopping   we look for something that gets good gas mileage   requires low maintenance   and is comfortable to ride in   we ve had a chevy   a   and a gmc   but once we got our first   we found out what driving a truck is all about   the has a good size bed for hauling   a strong enough to tow just about anything   and all the amenities you get from a car   s with the extra cab and jump seats are especially nice for families with young children   part and repair on the are very reasonable   not that i have had to repair anything   my truck gets about   miles to the gallon   which is good for a truck   being a woman   i am always looking for a reliable car   i don t want to deal with repair work   i want to feel protected even in a small truck   i want to know that i won t break down in the middle of no where at night   in my   i have all the securities i am looking for   it has duel air bags   with a shut off switch for the passengers side   adjustable shoulder belts allow anyone to wear the seat belt comfortably   anti lock breaks allow me to drive the california freeways without fear   reasonable price and easy on the insurance   the is the best small truck on the market br br  
843,1,  is it even possible for to make a good auto   hey it could happen   model info    edge price paid    strengths   looks    l engine   power   edge styling   ride   great cd   weaknesses    interior doo dads    no map pocket on back of seats   no vanity mirror   no map lights   you must get the   the   l ca nt pull anything   my dome light sensor makes the light stay on    not after the hammer   they replaced it   times until my warranty ran out   now i have no lights and a lil red light on my dash that always stays on   that has been the worst mechanical problem for me   i have replaced most s oem air   fuel and suspension parts   they are to weak to have fun with   all i can say is i hate dealerships   i will never have another car of mine worked on at one   the people they hire are usless compared to   previously owned   stx   checked out chevy s   toyota tacoma   nissan frontier review summary   my former was rock solid and the new edge is just as good   i custom ordered the edge model   x    l engine   automatic   extended cab   power equip group   cd changer   i have had constant coments on the looks and no one can tell that it it not a x   the edge package is a little sparse on interior extras   but that is by design   i have plenty of room for my gear inside bikes in the back   great power acceleration   and the automatic is a must for seattle traffic   gas mileage is pretty good as well   mpg right out of the gate   i love this truck and would recommend to anyone  
844,1,  i purchased this fully loaded   for my wife   the truck is the four door x off road model with every option available   the sticker price was      i purchased this truck to replace our     without a doubt the   door option is the greatest improvement   it makes the extended cab both useful and convenient   also introduced a combination cassette cd stereo this year which has great sound   we couldn t believe that our   model was without cupholders   corrected the problem in the   model   the   handles very well on the road   we have a cabin near yellowstone and the manages the unplowed roads      inches with ease   it has tow hooks in front and back which make it easy for us to help friends without xs when they take on more than their truck or car can handle i would not recommend that the off road package be purchased unless the buyer really had off road use   we love the flare sides on our sport model and really appreciated the automatic transmission and   wheel drive on the fly   all of the options are expensive   but it is a great looking sporty truck to drive br br  
845,1,  we recently purchased the   trail head   we haven t seen any on the street since we bought ours   i feel it isn t getting enough publicity the new trailhead has a similar package to the   x big guys   with it s   quot   wheel base and high suspension   from the first look to the last you will mistake this new trailhead for a x truck it however does not ride like any ordinary truck we ve driven before   it is quiet and comfortable   get down to your dealer right away and test drive this sporty and definately great looking pick up     
846,1,  i bought my sport in july of   and have not had any problems with it   i am really happy with the way it handles   i used to have a   explorer sport and the   handled like a dump truck compared to my     the steering is tight and there is minimal body lean   the power is very good   my   had pretty good power of the line but was a dog on the highway   my   is another story   my   has   hp versus   hp and you can really feel the difference on the highway and the off the line power is real good too   the seats are real firm but comfortable   my sport has the pioneer   watt   disc changer with subwoofer   man this stereo sounds great   the interior looks great too with high quality   mine has the overhead console too with compass and outside temperature with i find pretty useful although i did not think i would initially   the exterior styling is totally awesome    the best looking suv out there   i get between   and   miles per gallon which i think is acceptable for a suv   so i can say that i am really happy with my   sport  
847,1,  we had a   aerostar and really liked it   but when the transmission started to go we decided to shop for a   new to us   van we didn t know what we would end up with since we were shopping used   when we found the windstar we ended up buying   we were pleased   we had to sacrifice on a couple of features we wanted but it had better safety ratings than the caravan   which were everywhere on the used car lots we sacrificed on the dual sliding door when we were shopping we were close to having   children   and under and we wanted the ease of it   but reading safety reviews we realized that while giving up on convenience we were gaining in safety   as it turns out it wasn t a real sacrifice as the front drivers seat slides forward in such a way that a child can easily get into his seat and the driver slides the seat back into place easily   one thing we were not happy to give up was the heat air controls to the rear of the van   thankfully we live in a very mild area with few temperature extremes so the boys don t get too hot or too cold our gas mileage has been much better with this van than with the heavier aerostar   i also like how it handles like a car we knew when purchasing this van that there is no trunk space    it has a lot more than the caravan however   it is difficult to fit a stroller in the back one of our double strollers is too big and won t fit   we had been spoiled by having the aerostar extended so this has been an adjustment   i actually damaged the window tinting film by trying to cram a larger item into the too small trunk   if you have the choice by the extended version   the seats do pop out fairly easily   but while they can be done by only one person it is better suited to two people doing it we have had problems with the locks   we have keyless remote entry   sometimes either the sliding door or the trunk lock will not unlock that way   thankfully we did discover that we can disarm the alarm and then use the key to unlock the stuck lock we also have a van that makes a very funny whiny noise   we ve grown used to it and it doesn t affect how it drives   but it is a bit annoying   we ve had our van described as a   rocket van   due to the noise i really like that carseat tether straps attach directly to a metal piece on the seat rather than the floor   it makes it much easier for the passengers in the rear bench seat to get into his seat   it is nice and roomy for our four boys and all the seats are quite comfortable   i would definitely buy a windstar again and do recommend it highly after all   all vehicles have minor quirks  
848,1,  we own a   windstar   we and everyone else who rides in it   is completely impressed by how well it handles and how smooth the ride is   i really love this car   we got the basic model with very few extras   still   it is a great car for the money   i didn t realize what an awesome vehicle it was until we were in a car accident   another vehicle pulled into the drivers side of our vehicle   we were going    he was probably going     we were thrown off the road   and i was   months pregnant   very scary   however   the windstar shut off when we were hit   so we avoided a huge pine tree in front of us   also   from the looks of the inside of the vehicle   i though no damage had been done   i calmed myself down   then got out   and saw that the entire drivers side of the van looked like it had been bent in half   it was unbelievable   the drivers seat and all passenger seat areas on that side were not affected at all   i was very impressed and relieved   neither of us had any physical injuries or problems   at that point i was sold on driving a windstar for the rest of my life   we have put      miles on our windstar in   years   we travel an awful lot   we have had one malfunction with the vehicle   our transmission went   that is the only complaint i have about this vehicle   i am not sure if it went because of how much we use it or not   we have a theory that it could be related to the accident we were in   as a side note   we were told that is a good idea to have the transmission serviced sooner than the owners manual suggests   i love the way the vehicle is laid out   i like the cup holders   the little compartments   and the handle to help you get in and out   also   there are tether strap holders for car seats on every possible location standard in the windstar   in addition   my husband s brother   a    quot   basketball player has accompanied us on road trips   and he prefers the back bench   so i guess it is fairly roomy back there   we plan on buying another windstar   when we do buy again     
849,1,  when we first married   my husband and i thought there wasn t any need for one of those staid   quot family quot   vehicles   the s equivalent of the station wagon   it didn t take long   two kids   to realize what the attraction is all about the windstar first caught my eye by being the only us made minivan that had received a   star frontal crash rating from the u s   government   interest piqued when the insurance institute showed us all how bad an off set crash can be   now i had to drive one of these for myself the base windstar gl is a no frills van   with the    l engine producing   hp   not enough for someone trading in a     so we decided that at the least we needed the optional    l v    which produces a more satisfying   hp   vroom vroom   the   l engine also provides very sufficient power for highway merging and passing   and is fairly fast off the start line   ok   my nickname used to be   quot mrs   andretti quot   match this with the   speed transmission   and we are ready to roll   literally since we knew that we would spend part of the ownership time in warmer climates   we sought a van with the rear air option   this can be operated by the controls on the dash   or the controls set into the pillar behind the driver   the b pillar in guy speak   air flows into the cavernous rear area from a vent on the same pillar   and from four other vents   two above the middle seat   and two above the third seat   we have not had any problems with the a c   even living in muggy hawaii   the van also cranks out some heat   enough to have to lower the settings after only a few minutes    did i mention we used to live outside seattle   hmm minivans overall tout seating for seven   with not being an exception   we have found that two adults can sit comfortably in the third seat with a child   but three adults in that seat are a tight fit   the seats themselves are very comfortable on long trips   but you pay for that feel when lugging them out   for smaller people   this could be a two person task   the third bench folds down onto itself   and rolls forward to touch the middle bench   opening up the rear cargo area even more   had the correct intentions when installing tether strap anchors in the windstar   putting two on the middle bench and one on the front passenger seat   that s correct   one under the front passenger seat   this puzzles me even more when i note that they neglected to put even one on the third row bench most buyers in the market for a larger vehicle have come to expect that you pay for the safety and roominess at the gas pump   again   is right there in the pack with all the other auto makers   we average about   mpg in the city   and   highway   the   gallon tank keeps me from living at the local supply hut   gas station   but it does hurt when refueling   on newer models   now offers a   gallon tank   but that could just be delaying the inevitable our van of choice was a great find at a washington dealer   for      we ended up with exactly what we were looking for   we have many options available with the lx such as the roof rack   aforementioned rear air   privacy glass    quot premium sound quot   system   more speakers basically   power locks and windows   and headrests for every seating position except the third bench   middle seat   the power rear quarter windows are great for airing the van out   and the power side view mirrors make an easy task of adjusting for individual driver tastes   the only option lacking from the step up is the power driver seat   which may be more hassle than it is worth   the   windstar has a good list of standard options   abs brakes   dual front airbags   nicer cloth seats than some other auto makers   plymouth comes to mind   power steering and brakes   height   adjustable seatbelts for front passengers   tilt wheel and cruise control   which has controls set into the steering wheel itself   with the   model only   delayed jumping on the driver side sliding door addition in a very interesting way   the driver door is longer than other model years   and the driver seat is positioned on rails   the seat will slide up against the steering wheel   allowing easy access through the doorway   when i first saw this option   i wondered what idiot thought of this   i didn t see a need for entry on that side   not with a   ft   entryway on the other   ahh   motherhood   as the mother of two small kids   my husband and i can position ourselves on each side of the van to load kids   the space left open behind this seat is large by any means   i can stand hunched over   adjusting my daughter s car seat   and i am   ft   tall   while i envy the driver side door   since it would be a much easier option   i know i would lose the convenient cupholder   recessed bin   and rear a c control access that my   year old has right there   the drive   the van can t corner on rails   and i wouldn t recommend trying it   but it does have a comfortable ride   small bumps in the road are hidden   the steering wheel has a solid feel to it   and very little road noise intrudes into the cabin area   at highway speeds   some tire noise is heard   but it is not very loud   we recently had to have the transmission rebuilt   under warranty   thank you   and it was a little soon in the life of any vehicle   at    miles   oh those pesky axod transmissions   is reputed to have known of problems with certain transmissions linked to certain engine sizes   but luckily we were able to have ours fixed under warranty   because of the infamous   l engine   head gasket problems and transmission problems   i can t give my van   stars   as much as it pains me to admit after over a year of ownership   we don t know what we would do without this wonderful invention called the minivan   i do have to note that it has been to the shop twice this year   the   quot check engine quot   light came on   requiring a trip to the dealer for an evaporator and an oxygen sensor replacement   it was during this visit that the dealership noted for us the transmission hesitation   and scheduled us for a second visit   the service department at the local dealer was very helpful   as dealerships go   when it was determined that necessary parts had to be ordered from the mainland   the dealership paid for a   week car rental   my choice   explorer   heehee   all of this was covered under warranty   so our only out of pocket costs so far have been for oil changes   anyone in the market for a used minivan   looking for the safest   used   van available   well   you just found it     
850,1,  i purchased my new windstar on january     and have driven it some    miles   i keep complete computer records on mileage   maintenance   and repairs and would like to report that i have averaged    mpg during this time with a low mileage of    and high mileage of    mpg while always using regular unleaded fuel in this v    l engine   about one third of my driving is on interstates and the balance is short trips   i view the windstar as reliable   but the following items had to be addressed   to wit     replaced both headlight assemblies due to moisture invasion     replaced the transmission field sensor     repaired the transmission due to a faulty mid range part     replaced a cruise control assembly    replaced a defective driver side door window activator   and    re calibrate the computer   this sounds like a lot of work   but all was replace under warranty by my excellent dealer and the vehicle is performing well i really like the excellent ride probably due in part to the larger   inch wheelbase   the van is relatively quite and is most responsive during acceleration and de acceleration     
851,1,  we ve had our   windstar since it was new and give it an overall excellent to superb rating   pros   the windstar is a decent sized minivan   there is enough cargo space behind the back seat to load a couple hundred dollars worth of groceries   other minivans i looked at such as the plymouth caravan   japanese models   and the chevy astro were lacking in this area the windstar is a nice riding vehicle with great driveability   the seats are very comfortable for long trips and the dash is laid out perfectly   this van is probably heavier than it s counterparts   which will affect gas mileage and performance   but it s worth it for it s   star safety rating   this vehicle feels very   very solid weather sealing is superb   road noise is not bad at all   the brakes have performed flawlessly and still do not require replacement at the k mile mark the engine and transmission have performed flawlessly and are very smooth though shifts can be mushy at times   you re better off turning off the over drive in town or the transmission may   hunt   for the right gear   i like how put the over drive button on the gearshift making this very simple and easy cons   the door ajar sensing switches are prone to failure causing the light and audible alarm to continue to annoy you until you exceed   mph   this is very frustrating   it will usually quit within the first mile or two but needs to find a permanent fix for this problem   this same problem existed in the aerostar   you d think they could find a better system   update   i found that if you spray wd   or a similar light oil in the door latch this problem may go away   dirt seems to be the culprit since the door ajar switches part of the door latch   this area obviously isn t sealed the driver side and passenger side front doors are too large   this is great when you need them but when you park on an upward incline they tend to slam shut at the most inopportune times   i e   on your legs or back when leaning in the vehicle   even worse your kids   this is the only safety factor with this vehicle   for some reason each of the four cars and vans i have owned have had problems with excessive battery corrosion   the batteries usually last two years at the most   my gmc pick up has seven years on a four year battery and is still starting fine recommendations   if you want a   windstar look for the following options and or problems    get rear air conditioning even if you live in a cool climate   it ll add to the resale value and the additional air ducting will help with heating for the rear passengers in the winter    opt for the large engine   the    is what i have and it s very peppy but the    would provide nearly the same gas mileage with an increase of torque and horsepower     check the front suspension for loose or damaged components   i had a bolt loosen itself on the front stabilizing bar in the passenger side wheel well   it made rattling noises whenever a bump was hit   i torqued it down and have had no problems since    test drive the vehicle to see if it has the faulty door ajar sensors other than the things mentioned this vehicle has been very reliable and a pleasure to drive   other brands of minivans also have their quirks and problems too which you ll find if you look at reviews for those   i feel the windstar is a very safe and reliable vehicle for the entire family and a good value update   as of march   the windstar is still a reliable vehicle   some problems noted since writing my initial review are    drivers side window quit working and sliding door lock quit working   these items should not have failed with    miles on the vehicle   resale value has also dropped faster than i anticipated   i would still recommend this vehicle though even with these flaws  
852,1,  i don t even own a minivan   but i wish i did   i have a two year old and a three month old   and drive a small car   that is one tough thing to do   my father recently purchased a windstar   and i fell in love with it i love the fact that there are climate controls in the front and back   the doors can be locked from the tailgate   the seats adjust nicely   and the windows can be rolled up after the ignition is turned off i think my favorite feature about this minivan is that the driver s seat can be moved forward to get to the back seat without having to go around to the other side   i have borrowed my dad s windstar many times   and this really comes in handy the safety ratings on this vehicle have highly impressed me   and the ease of use has me sold   when i do buy another vehicle   it will be the windstar   it drives great   and rides even better br br  
853,1,  after being in a horrible accident with the   of us in the van   i decided to look   quot only quot   for a mini van with the highest crash test ratings for safety   that is the only way for my family   windstar rated the best among all the mini vans on the market today   i love my windstar   its nice looking and very safe for my family   it has the abs brakes   front and passenger side airbag   and the drop down in the case of a front crash to keep the from coming in on the driver and front passenger   keyless entry   and for those of us with our hands full and unable to use the key to unlock the doors this is a great feature that i definately wanted and needed and its a wonderful thing to have   the seats and everything are nice inside and looks and feels great the price is right too for this nice mini van   and the style is a wonderful atribution to the family br br  
854,1,  we were expecting our fourth child and knew that riding in two cars was just not economical or expectable   i always have wanted a mini van and to be honest never considered a till shopping around   yes the sales people did make a difference   but what really did it for us was that we could get what we wanted   for the price we wanted without upgrading it and getting every little add on   we chose the one we did because of the room   the simplicity   little computer components   which to us means lower repair bills   what really surprised us is the mileage   we have driven it to florida twice now and it beat our honda accord hands down and was so much more comfortable   the turning ratio is not as good as some we drove   but the roominess and the comfort is fantastic and a better trade   i am overweight and everything fits me   which is another bonus we will always by one   just keep trading it up for a new one   i test drove them all and will never turn from the windstar again br br  
855,1,  i was very skeptical about buying a mini van   once i test drove the windstar   model   i knew it was the mini van for me   i bought the windstar because of the price and because of the five star safety test   i have three kids so i need lots of room for soccer balls   book bags and other things boys collect   i would have to say that windstar has tons of room on the inside   the back seat folds down fairly easily and there is tons of space behind the back seat to store a stroller and groceries   i haven t had any problems with my windstar so far but i highly recommend it     
856,1,  right now i am a year and a half into my second windstar and couldn t be happier with it   i leased a    windstar and returned it after the lease was up   i would have loved to have purchased it but financially it just wouldn t work because of the good luck i had with the    when i was in the market in    i bought another windstar   even with all the hype surrounding the redesigned i felt the windstar was still the only minivan that didn t drive like a truck   the windstar felt and handled like a larger car   the only thing i didn t really like is the front end design   the grille work and lights make the van look   quot unhappy quot   look at it and you ll see with the facelift the    received and the addition of another sliding door the windstar has just gotten better recommendations   definitely get the v   you will need the power two minor annoyances   the cupholders for the front are not too sturdy   one of mine broke already   the sensors for the sliding door are very sensitive   they give false readings that the door is not closed all the way br br  
857,1,   bulletin   our explorer was nudging    miles during a difficult month for us    a major service was needed but i was paralyzed with indecision about how the nearest dealer in carson city nv would react   my preliminary inquiries about the car and possible warranty issues   were simply brushed off with condescending comments    no offers to fix things b   we were filled with misgivings for months   i did not trust them   our laundry list had grown a bit   the front passenger seat belt was hanging up now   that was preceded by troubles with the hazard lights switch   the rear window wiper would not work   and a couple of minor irritants   came the day of decision    i took the car over the hill   sierras   to sacramento   ca where we had purchased our prize   the service consulant appeared   wrote up the    mile service     i added a     including labor   set of mud flaps   then he lent a very interested ear to my woes   he looked at all four items   wrote them down   i asked him to estimate the costs to me    i was willing to come all the way back    mile round trip   to accommodate their schedule   he blinked   then took the keys    and offered me a free rental car b   the best place to be while enduring dentistry and car repairs is elsewhere and i went there for several hours   i returned after several hours to find the   explorer   still sitting in its stall   of course   it was a   big   service and i had added the mud flaps at the last second   after another hour   came the call        ok     plus       plus sales tax      deductible on warranty   seemed ok   what about the repairs estimate     huh   those items were fixed    on warranty b   i fainted   it is incredible how much difference a dealer can make    with the recent models of their   explorer   suv the appears to have beaten the import market at its own game   in fact     has become   an import   having absorbed such as jaguar and volvo recently   these acquisitions came with new   foreign   expertise   combined with the best of a century of manufacturing and merchandising in the usa   with these assets   is producing new products that deliver what the buyer has become used to getting during the past   years   what did do   study the competition and note what the buyers like and try to do it better   rather than torment buyers with agonizing decisions about options that should be standard items   has created and delivers a standardized vehicle in three basic versions   any one of which can overcome buyer resistance with an ample complement of attractive and useful features that make sense and are easy to use   it should not be necessary to mention but high quality workmanship should be evident everywhere in the vehicle   it is    what made us consider this vehicle b   from   to    we owned imports by bmw   audi   vw and toyota   in that order   they offered reasonable pricing   fuel economy   needed few options and were readily recognizable   they delivered performance and   at times   lots of satisfaction but a graph would show how we fared monetarily    outrageously costly maintenance says it all   our son   cured of his addiction to toyotas   purchased a camry replacement last year    one of his best friends is an executive with   it was a explorer   with two wheel drive and so   we were ready to be   converted   back   or domesticated    the purchase b   after two years of planning   we ventured into the car market   for budgeting reasons   the used car market was suitable for us and the search began   my wife wrote the specifications   explicitly   what she wanted had to be white   have four doors   less than five years old   have low mileage   a reasonable price   and comfortable   my input was limited to avoiding   wheel drive fully prepared   we went off on a joyride one friday and found our dream car   no luck on color   otherwise they had a   that met her criteria   exceeded it   in fact   the mileage was only     marilyn   currently the breadwinner of the family   did the road testing   it was a   go   the light green car sold itself    operating   the first impression when entering the explorer is of the ample head room provided in the opening   as well as the roof ceiling height   no more contusions on my poor pate   although the explorer is a relatively complex vehicle   it is easy to drive   the engine power is ample   easily overcoming challenges from changes in terrain   although the center of gravity is higher   the explorer glides around curves    being a car on a truck chassis   the ride becomes   jouncy   when passing over bumps and depressions in the pavement at slow speeds   this is a negligible nuisance i   the transmission gear changes are barely perceptible   the transitions to and from overdrive are detectable only on the tachometer   the overdrive control is within reach of an extended finger on the gear selection stalk   acceleration is startlingly effective   the sohc v needs only the lightest touch on the pedal to take the explorer from standing start to road speed   i estimate that adequate performance in traffic requires only about     of pedal   why all that power   for towing a ton and a half trailer with full passenger complement    the explorer is also available with a v engine   the operation of which must be pretty exciting i   the instruments and controls are clustered to allow the operator to run the machine without undue distraction from the road and traffic   crucial instruments are larger   crucial controls   including windshield visibility   are within reach of an extended finger   one must reach for others   an effort that usually involves taking one s eyes off the road   driver information from the instrument set is abundant   although some warning lights are so small that anxiety can replace knowledge   as in an aircraft cockpit   an operator should know the instrument layout so well that a   sweeping   scan is all that is needed to ascertain that operations are normal   close scrutiny is advisable only when the vehicle is stopped   the same goes for the steering wheel   tilt   adjustment   simply stated   do not try to do this while the vehicle is in motion   handling is rewarding and crisp   the explorer has a very tight turning ratio   making it one of the most nimble vehicles we have driven   at road speeds   the steering is very sensitive   requiring very little input from the operator   this advantage has a price   one should maintain high levels of attention to the task at hand   both hands   that is   braking is steady and smooth   we have not tested the panic conditions for which the abs system was designed   the parking brake works   an easy push of the foot will set it   the controls for the   cruise   control   labeled   speed   for some reason   are located on the steering wheel   one should get to know the   buttons by touch   studying them on the road is foolishness   the system is very accurate   requiring only a touch to set and to disable    cautionary advisory   since it is a relatively high performance design   the explorer is demanding on drivers   who must learn to concentrate on the task of running this finely tuned machine   all too often   drivers seem to become intoxicated with the suv concept and design and allow the vehicle to govern them   an operator who is distracted by passengers   usecured items items in the seating areas   comfort and audio control settings and   of course   the infamous cell phones   is out of control and is a hazard to persons and property   a lack of attention can lead to an unpleasant emergency situation   of course   the aggressive driver is a threat to all   a high performance vehicle like the explorer is unforgiving of driver errors   which can account for some of the highly publicized rollovers    tire air pressure is problematic   the recent spate of highly publicized accidents illustrate that   in the explorer operator s manual   the recommendation is to inflate per instructions molded onto the tire itself   psi on our present equipment   on the explorer itself   a door sticker advises a conflicting pressure of only   psi   this utterly silly and dangerous advice probably stemmed from some anxious sales executive who meant to   soften   the ride for some target buyer segment that dislike   hard   or bumpy rides    or trucks in general   the explorer design came from the     pickup chassis   anyone with experience with radial tires going flat will recollect how sloppy the handling becomes   follow the instructions on the tire you are inflating i    disappointments   we had some at first   exacerbated by an indifferent dealer in nevada     miles north of here   per the above   all disappointments were remedied by a crackerjack dealer     miles west of here    satisfaction   it is a complete success with us   we have had it for eight months now and expect to keep it for    years   so far   each day has brought a new and happy surprise for us    ours is a   wd   two wheel drive     not a d   two door   model   sport   which is otherwise similar but shorter

858,1,  i love my   explorer with automatic transmission and four wheel drive for one thing   the ride is smoother than the ride of the average truck   and i love the increased height of the vehicle    my honda civic is a great little car but i feel like i m dragging my butt on the ground in comparison in   quot christopher quot    yes   i name my cars   the great explorer and protector   i can survey the road from a dominant position   other drivers stay out of my way i m canyon woman    queen of the wild frontier when it rains hard   we have many flood sites here in san antonio   but i need not worry   if that sedan in front of me can make it through the water   i ve got it made   i m canyon woman    queen of the wild frontier when i go shopping for small furniture   i need not hire a mover   i m tough and able to carry my own purchase   i m well   you know in case of deep snow   well   it could happen even here in south texas   i m ready   rough terrain is my christopher s forte   i love my power seat package and plan to buy the equivalent in any future vehicle   the ability to fine tune the seat position makes a significant difference in driver and passenger comfort air conditioner heater controls for back seat passengers greatly increase their comfort the v engine is the perfect blend of power   yet economy   the extra wide cargo space is home to furry pups as well as bricks and garden supplies you name it my only error in choosing this vehicle was in the color   the   quot mocha frost quot    okay tan   exterior looks exactly like    of the other explorers on the road   i often approach a look alike in the parking lot   wondering why my   quot clicker quot   isn t working to unlock the door   also   the tan interior shows dirt far worse than my previous vehicle with a gray interior the left turn signal seems a little glitchy   often turning itself off before i get to the turn   my friend s explorer does the same thing i had warranty work done to fix a problem with the column shift when christopher was new   the service was problem free after five years my only service expenses have been for routine maintenance i love to take my explorer out on the road after a good wash and wax with tires gleaming and the radio blasting   okay   so i listen to talk radio and my hearing s not as good as it used to be i m canyon woman queen of the wild frontier br br  
859,1,  i wanted something that could haul anything   anywhere   and at anytime   at the same time   i wanted it to have a comfortable ride   and good handling   my explorer limited has done all of this and more   i ve only had to do regular maintenance services   if i were to knock it   i wish it stood taller on the road   mine is a   and has performed better than i expected   i do wish utility vehicles got a little better gas mileage   the seats are comfortable on long trips   i m not beat up nor fatigued when i get to my destination   it s a nice compromise between a regular road car   van   amp   pick up truck   i d highly recommend one to any one looking for versatility   if you want a vehicle that will do many things besides get you there   you should definitely consider a utility vehicle   you won t be disappointed     
860,1,  i have found that used explorers are a good investment most of the time   it seems that previous owners take pride in maintaining these vehicles in top condition   i own a   explorer   eddie bauer edition   this vehicle still looks new and drives just like new   it handles well and gives a firm ride   which is what a sport utility vehicle is supposed to do   if you are looking for a soft luxury ride   don t buy a suv   buy a luxury car   but   if you are looking for a good handling   firm ride and towing abilities   then consider a new or used explorer in the   door body style   not the   door sport   it is short and the ride is not as good   the only problem i have encountered in     miles is when towing the gas mileage drops dramatically   i have the v    should have had a v   br br  
861,1,  my husband jeff is a contractor that travels all over the country   up until december of   he did this in a very large   very old   very unsafe passenger van   i knew he had been looking around for a used vehicle to pull his   foot cargo trailer around the country with   then one day i got a call from him   he was in chicago and he had just test drove a brand spanking new   f dually   he immediately fell in love with it   it was a long bed x with a powerstroke diesel   the dealership even let him hook up his trailer for the test drive   after much haggling   he finally got the price down from     to      he then filled out the credit application and headed home then told me about his little adventure   but that s another story   he got the call a couple of days later to come pick up his shiny new truck   so he back off to chicago of course   from the beginning   i held a grudge and hated everything about this truck   i was a    payment we didn t really need   it was brand new   and with the amount of miles he drives   i just knew it was a bad investment to buy a new vehicle   and it was big   extremely big   but jeff convinced me that it was much safer for him than the old van   and that the diesel engine would last a very long time   slowly but surely this truck that i had deemed so evil started to grow on me   of course it was hard to get used to driving this monster vehicle after driving my   taurus for the past year and a half   but i soon mastered it   soon   i grew to love this truck more than my trusty taurus   the powerstroke diesel is much quieter than the cummins that and chevy use   and it has more power   so when you re pulling a   foot trailer loaded down with shingles   carpet and linoleum the truck doesn t lurch   it also doesn t use any more fuel than it normally would without the trailer   the powerstroke is reliable   and the transmission behind it very strong   being in the construction business   my husband knows many guys with different trucks   and many of these guys have had their trucks in the shop several times getting work done on their alison trannies   any down time on your truck in this business is a week without a paycheck   so we appreciate the dependability of the   but there are times   although few and far between   that my husband isn t on the road and we use the truck to haul friends and family instead of a trailer   the width and length of the crew cab makes the interior enormous   we have had   adults in the truck and there was still plenty of room to stretch out   the crew cab was made for just that   a crew   the folks at did a wonderful job of designing the interior of the cab   in addition to being roomy   it offers plenty of adjustable cup holders   front and back seats   extra power outlets   and storage   any road noise and diesel noise is deadened inside the truck   the seats are very comfortable and the design is ergonomic   which is extremely important when you drive up to   hours a day to get across the country   when jeff bought the truck   it had   miles on it   now   a year later   it has over     and over    of those miles have been pulling a trailer   we have not had any hint of trouble so far   and have never done anything but regular maintenance and tire changes on it   of course   regular maintenance is a bit more expensive than on my little taurus   which only takes   qts of oil   but the longevity of the diesel will be worth it   this truck is very practical for anyone that has many people to haul around   for people that pull trailers or rv s   or just desires a strong truck to do everyday chores such as pulling large stumps   helping stranded motorists   or hauling heavy loads   the only thing i don t like about the truck is the fact that for in town use   going to the grocery store and such   the sheer size of it makes parking very difficult   and it may catch a few curbs in town while going around corners   make sure you re ready for that before you purchase it   but all around   this is a well thought out   powerful truck that still rides smooth and will last a very   very long time     
862,1,  at the time of this writing   i have had my svt focus for about two weeks   and i am in love let s start with the visuals   personally   i have a very slight issue with the way the window line travels up to the rear of the car on the sides   and then back down to a point on the gate   i don t think it looks   bad    per se   but i can t tell you exactly what the issue i have actually   is    i can only say there s   something   about it   so   i ordered mine in black not only because i love black cars   but also to de emphasize the rear window line   i even blacked out the windows with dark tint   i think it looks completely sharp in black   and let me tell you    if darth vader drove a car   this would be it i love s new edge design concept   which traces it s roots back directly to the gt   concept car of the early nineties   who says concept cars serve no purpose in the production world   and i think they did a particularly bang up job with the focus   door   much better than the new style cougar   the car looks like it s hauling a   even when it s parked   i often find myself standing and staring at it after parking just because it looks so darned cool   the agressive   angular front end mates well with the curved   swooping roofline that tapers off in the rear   and the custom fog lights   rear spoiler   and   inch argent five star rims that svt installed put the icing on the cake   not that cheap sugar icing   either    we re talking gourmet butter icing   baby and   although it is defined as a   small car   it really isn t that small   it s taller than most of the cars i park next to   and the wheelbase is   inches let s talk about comfort now the smell of the leather interior is absolutely dreamy   and it is outdone only by the way the svt seat wraps around you and makes you feel completely comfy while driving   they fit   me   so well   in fact   that when i m driving   i actually can not feel the seat   say what   you read that right   let me explain   you know how   after you ve been in a car for a while   you can tell what parts of the seat are pushing on you   maybe your thighs are pressing against the side supports   or the lumbar support is jutting into your back a tad too much   or maybe even that darned seatbelt extension is about an inch too long   and it s poking your beer belly   no problems for me in the svt   even after extended periods in the car   the seat feels completely natural   this is due   in part   to the nice adjustments built into them   not only can you adjust the lumbar support   back angle   and forward position   but you can also adjust the ride height of the seat   very nice for adjusting the headroom and seeing over the steering wheel   should you need a   boost   btw   i m      lbs   just so you can gauge driving position is excellent and sporty   the steering wheel and gear shifter are   exactly   where they should be in relation to the driver   all controls are within easy reach   and the leather wrapped wheel and shift knob are a dream to grab   the silver faced guage cluster is awesome and easy to see   at night   the faces glow green and the numbers are black   the red svt graphic on the panel glows purple under the gauge lights    pretty cool i think the stereo controls could have been laid out a little more stylishly   but they aren t bad   they re definitely better than the plastic toy speak   n spell style buttons that gm loves to put in their vehicles   the stereo display is large and very easy to read   oh   by the way   it sounds great   too   the subwoofer is very powerful   especially for an eight incher   it is concealed in a nicely finished ported box that sits on the driver side wall in the cargo area   this takes up a little bit of your cargo room   of course   but hey    did i buy an svt to haul groceries and gear in huge quantities   no   i can deal with it   the six disc in dash cd changer is a luxury    no annoying cartridge to deal with   you just load them all in the slot   there is also a radio stereo control stalk that comes off the steering column on the lower left side for easy finger tip sound control while driving in summation   when you close the door and seal yourself inside   the relationship of driver and car is t i g h t road noise is a bit of an issue   due in large part   in my opinion   to the low profile contisport tires and large    rims   that s a lot more solid material to transfer sound   and you can tell   it s not bothersome to me   but if it irks someone like you   then the application of some aftermarket spray undercoating would take care of a lot of the noise yes   the ride is rough on less than desireable roads   but i wouldn t have it any other way   you pay a price for a car that performs and handles as well as the svt focus handling is a dream   pure and simple   i didn t think it was possible   but the svt handles as well and is as fun to drive as my hopped up alfa romeo gtv   and that is saying a   lot    if you have ever driven an alfa   you know what fun they are   and the svt matches   the car goes exactly where you point it   and there is no perceivable torque steer   which is something that has always irked me about front drivers   how tight is it   last night i took a corner that was marked for   mph at    i don t recommend you try this at home   coming into the unexpected turn   i thought i was going to dig a trench   but instead   the svt dipped its nose   dug in   and sprung right back out again   taking the turn and teaching the road a lesson while it was at it   amazing   it behaved like it had a tough racing torsion bar suspension   in   dip   and out for a front driver especially       weight distribution b   the handling is amazingly neutral   there is no pronounced over   or understeer   unless you really   want   it to be there   once again   the driver is in command the engine is amazing   took the already nice zetec i   found in the zx and cooked up a variable intake valve timing system   which ups the hp from   to    and gives you   lb ft of torque to work with   couple this power with the   gorgeous   getrag six speed gear box   and you have speed on demand through the entire range of the engine   seriously   there are no dead spots in the power curve   from stop to redline   the will pull and go like a champ   with no perceivable lag anywhere   and it sounds great doing it the gear ratios are right on target   too   normally   with a modern manual transmission   esp   a six speed   i expect fifth or sixth gear to be sort of an   overdrive   gear   not worth much for performance   however   sixth gear in the svt is actually a useable gear   all of them are very nicely and smoothly spaced in addition to the vivt system   also stuck in some other improvements   including forged steel connecting rods   aluminum pistons   and a dual stage intake system   which dramatically improves torque and low end performance   the compression ratio is also higher   at      so you have to use premium fuel there are also some pretty cool mods after the engine   including the dual mass flywheel and one in two out shaft design of the gearbox   if you want to know how these work   you can find the info at svt you have to be careful when shopping for an svt focus   because many dealers will charge an extra fee on top of the msrp simply because it s an svt   and therefore more collectible   however   if you shop around   you can find dealers that won t gouge you   i found mine at covert   in austin   for sticker        which is exactly what says they should charge   northside   in san antonio   wanted k for the same car in case you didn t know   not all dealers sell svt cars   only specially authorized dealers get them   and they are only allotted a certain number per year   if you find one for msrp   don t expect to talk them down on the price   either   svts are also usually exempt from any special deals or rebates   having the svt badge on your car guarantees a certain level of collectibility   and the dealers know it being an svt owner has other perks as well   you get a free one year membership to the svt owners assoc   and a free loaner car when yours is in for servicing   nice touch if you re into it   there are also tons of aftermarket performance parts available for the focus   not that it needs it  
863,1,  when i started   looking   for a new auto i became   focused    no pun intended   on the specification and configuration requirements that were important to me   now   to tell the truth   i may be a little biased as i generally like fords and would only consider subaru as a japanese auto but   nevertheless   i still made it my mission to be informed about all autos that met my criteria   out of the   models   that i narrowed it down to    the subaru forrester     only came with an   unremarkable   power source   the subaru impreza wrx kind of suited me but i was a little concerned about the interior room   this was a close one    i still love this car   the upcoming subaru baja would not be out for a while and still only had a mediocre engine   actually   i hadn t even considered a focus   why   i wanted to get away from front wheel drive vehicles   i had a   front driver   at the time   my first   and was a little put off by the   quirkiness   of its   handling characteristics   i was about ready to just wait until something came along that suited me    and then something made me decide to give the focus a try   i drove a   normal    zx and i loved it enough to consider buying it    but before i did i at least made the attempt to locate an svt model   to make a long story short    i bought one   the handling is great   the looks are cool   subjective   the interior room and features are incredulous   you may find it hard to believe but it does handle better than the wrx   though not as fast   this is what front wheel drive should feel like   only problem   mine came with a defect    the radiator had a hole or puncture   warranty item   there is no perfect car for everyone   rhetorical   but if i could be   greedy   then i d like to see   doors zx    more power and all wheel drive   like the wrx this car is astounding for the price but many may not consider it because they may   group   it as a small car associated with the younger genre  
864,1,  in dire need for a car to take to school with me in the fall   i was looking for something dependable since it s a   mile round trip   as well as affordable since   well   i don t have much money first   i test drove a stratus   and thanks to   epinions    i was able to see it would be nothing but a hassle and a money pit so   i re scoured the classified section of my newspaper and saw that there was a     taurus gl   for    available    quot loaded quot   the ad read   so i called the guy and went to look at it   surprised that the car only had k miles on it   i was thinking that this blue green beauty just might be a vehicular reality for me   i took it for a test drive   and this   l v practically drove itself out of the parking lot   it just wanted to go   i was very pleased with the way it handled turns   acceleration   reversals   and noticed no palpable thumps or rattles which would indicate problem spots   the dealer made sure to mention that the rotors may have to be turned or replaced   and that i might feel a slight vibration when i break quite the courteous remark   no in seeing that i know nearly nothing about cars   in a technical sense   i sent my older brother to look at it   in beautiful shape   he agreed that it seemed to be an excellent deal   so i purchased it at     since i paid in cash this car handles like a   grand am   around tight turns even when the speedometer is pushing    acceleration is no problem for this car as i have made it to   with ease   i i was just testing it i   the sound system is by   but they do an excellent job   so far it is a clear   seamless system which features a detachable radio antennae so that when i go through a car wash   i won t lose my fm   also   there are    extra   speakers in alignment with the side view mirrors   which further beautifies the sound   as it envelopes you even more    however    if you are looking to put in a new   stronger system with a cd player   mine just has am fm cassette   you may not be able to because of the way the   taurus b   radio face is set up   it is too big and basically encompasses the ac and heat control as well   so i am not aware whether or not a new system can be put in very easily   i have a feeling that you sacrifice performance for looks and convenience b lowdown   overall   however   i love this car   an excellent ride   i feel extremely safe in all respects   the trunk is   deep    an especially important consideration for a college student such as myself   it is a very roomy car   and as a rather big person at    quot   lbs   i have had no problem fitting comfortably   the power everything features of this car make it quite a pleasure to drive   and as for dependability   i consistently hear stories of historically pleased   taurus   owners who praise its longevity   try one today br br  
865,1,  history   i purchased this automobile at k and have driven it on paved to gravel roads   most of the miles on this car have been highway   i have replaced two unrelated engine sensors in the k i have driven it   these two sensors were backed up in the programming and did not disable the car before i took it to the shop   look and feel   this automobile is more stylish than the gm equivalents that i was comparing it to at the time   update your car interiors gm   and i have not been too impressed with my previous ownership encounters of and chrysler products   has a smooth ride and handles good for a larger car   it is very comfortable and it didn t feel like i was riding on the ground like some of the honda   subaru   or sporty autos   economy   the car averages    mpg on the highway   but does prefer the higher octane   and can ping under load on hills when driving slow back roads using   octane   body integrity   body is still in great shape and the paint still has a good finish   wiper arms were frozen one winter and were a problem   the wiper bolt will not keep arm fixed on the shaft   this part has aluminum splines and sheered off never to work properly again without modification or replacement   final comments   it has made for some comfortable   hour trips for four people numerous times   however the weight of the full trunk of luggage and the two people   small people in the back seat is a bit too much for the rear suspension   on some sharp quick inclines the car bottoms out on the springs and is that is not very comforting recommendation   i will buy this auto in the future when i need another   door sedan br br  
866,1,  we purchased a use   taurus lx earlier this year   now   i like the car   don t get me wrong   i just feel like a little old lady every time i get into it   it reminds me of my grandmother   who has always driven a   since my husband is   years older than me i ll give him a break   the taurus lx is the most luxurious car i ve ever driven   but then i ve only driven fun cars like trackers and eclipses   this vehicle is power everything   it s an automatic   i m still young enough to love a stick shift   the seats are the epitome of comfort who wants to fall asleep when their driving   it handles beautifully   there is a bare minimum of bumps in the road give me my tracker any day   i love bouncing down the road   it is very spacious   lot s of room for groceries or bodies depending on your hobbies   overall it s very comfortable   in about   years when my husband goes through his midlife crisis and buys that red convertible sports car   i guess i will be ready to settle down into a nice old lady car   it s nice to know it will be here waiting for me   i just hope it doesn t come to soon br br  
867,1,  after my daughter was born   i just knew that i would have to give up my need for speed   sports cars and kids just don t mix   i began my journey for an affordable family car with a little sport   and never dreamed i would find it in the taurus   my husband actually convinced me to test drive it   and i loved it   the back seat is wonderful for car seats   it is easy to put them in   and easy to remove them   there is child locks on the doors   and locks for the windows   the front middle seat pushes down for easy access to the kids   or folds up to reveal a neat little cubby hole for drinks   and any other junk you want to hide   the best part is that i can still get up and go   i love knowing that i can still beat those slow pokes at the red lights   and be safe in my taurus br br  
868,1,  has done an overall excellent job designing and building their new super duty line of trucks   with only a few exceptions   i own a   f super duty crew cab short bed x with the powerstroke diesel engine and an automatic transmission that i ordered from the factory and took delivery of in may of    i also recently helped relatives order their new   f super duty super cab   short bed x with the triton v engine and automatic transmission   the excellent stuff the new super duty trucks are the largest   tuffest   roomiest   nicest riding   and have the highest available tow ratings of any full size trucks in their class   the crew cab is particularly spacious in the front and rear seats   i am    quot   tall and   lbs   and i and   others of my size could quite comfortably ride for many hours in my truck   all the while towing a very large boat or travel trailer   i call my truck the    quot x limo quot i love the powerstroke diesel engine   but it is definitely not for everyone   the diesel engine has a very high torque rating of   ft lbs   and can more easily tow large boats or trailers than the gm trucks with their existing diesel engine   or the trucks with their cummins engine   i know this because i used to own a     x with the cummins diesel engine   the cummins diesel engine is a great   extremely durable engine   but the powerstroke is equally durable and has a more modern electronically controlled direct injection system   the powerstroke engine also meets california low emissions vehicle status   as does all of s super duty engines the styling of the truck is also excellent   when driving down the road   you sit about a foot higher than most other similar trucks and suvs   the drop down window design in the front doors contributes to excellent visibility of any nearby objects   and helps in parking   etc   the optional telescoping trailer towing mirrors are large   extremely useful and adjustable for wider or narrower trailers   the truck has a key locking tailgate   a nice touch   the crew cab seats are very comfortable and the leg room in the back is better than most luxury full size cars   the solid body structure of the crew cab is another contributor to a nice solid and quiet ride the not as good stuff the super duty trucks are very heavy across the line   they are between   and    lbs heavier than comparably equipped models from gm and   my truck weighs    lbs   full of fuel with no one and nothing in or on it   that is a lot   and more than i expected   some of this weight is due to the somewhat larger size of the super duty trucks   some of it is because the other manufacturers   gm in particular   have been more aggressive in trying to keep the weights of their trucks down   as a result of this heavier weight   the super duty trucks get slightly lower fuel economy when compared to similarly equipped competitor trucks some people have complained of automatic transmission problems   particularly when towing moving very large loads in extended extremely hard working situations   i have had absolutely no problems with my automatic transmission   there has been some other minor problems that i have heard from others and one recall notice for a minor fix   so   the truck is not perfect   but i love mine very much and wholeheartedly recommended it to others if you live and drive in a crowded major city   parking will kill you with this truck   they are simply large and heavy trucks   and one must be completely honest about what you really need   want and can live with p s   i have a tremendous amount of additional information from my ownership experiences   negotiating and ordering the truck   and from past trucks that i have owned       and   and my new     if anyone has specific questions   please feel free to email me at lvseng aol good luck and enjoy br br  
869,1,  i bought this vehicle because i fell in love with it at first site   then i drove one   and fell in love some more   i am impressed with it s handling it   wheel anti lock brakes   this truck is my dream vehicle i have a   f   supercab   x   lariat   v   gas engine   automatic i drive all over the country with my job   in all kinds of weather   and it handles great   the seats are extremely comfortable   and everything on the dash is easy to look at with out taking your eyes off the road   as well as easy to access   i am a    quot   woman   i have no trouble getting in and out   i do of course have running boards i usually get    mpg   but when i drive from mass to ca   i usually get      mpg   and since that is what the computer calculates an average   that means i am getting better gas mileage than that   that is excellent for a v   the comfort level of this truck is incredible   i love it   i also love the accessories that offers   such as a rear power sliding window   wood grained dash   front grille guard   fog lights   i know the   fog lights are standard   bug shield   an excellent bedliner   it is one of the best on the market as it is a duraliner   i also enjoy having a cd player that doesn t hog up my center container   like the   disk cd player in the   explorer does   i love the computer that is standard on the lariat   that gives the avg   gas mileage   temp   etc   i also like the placement of the cup holder in a slide on the dash   it is very convenient   the drivers cup holder is bigger than the passengers   great thinking i tow a loaded cargo trailer   as it contains all my belongings that i travel with   like i said i travel with my job all over the country   my truck doesn t even notice that the trailer is there   this truck is my daily driver if you want an excellent truck   with lots of options to make everyone happy   then get yourself a superduty   this isn t a small truck   but it is worth every inch and pound   if you want to drive the best truck on the road   then get yourself a superduty     
870,1,  i bought my second f super duty crew cab in august of    and wow   what a great vehicle   the   hp v   engine pulls like a well trained team of mules   the lariat interior package ensures ultimate style and comfort   the crew cab configuration yields room for six   the x is almost unstickable   the   in v is about what you can expect for gas mileage in a x configuration   the ride is a little stiff off pavement   but very comfortable on the highway   the carrying capacity is more than adequate   as i have hauled in excess of   pounds of feed with no problems   i have pulled a   lb farm tractor   and it was barely noticeable i bought this vehicle because i needed a pickup truck that had room for my family of four with plenty of cargo capacity   we have   ranches in texas   so i use this truck extensively off road   i love everything but the gas mileage and limited fuel capacity   the   gallon tank on the short bed model needs to be refilled far too frequently if you are looking for a vehicle that will turn a few heads   carry more than groceries and kids   go off road with style and comfort   and you don t mind poor mileage   this is your truck   get the lariat interior   the extra comforts are worth the price br br  
871,1,  my thunderbird was first car   after a long and dissapointing venture for a used car i finally found my t bird   at first i looked at a neon   yuck   then a    pontiac sunfire   but when i made the trip to greenbrook to the dealer it suddenly sold and the salesman tryed to convince me i wanted a   neon for     nope when i arrived home my mom was on the phone with my cousin how knew the owner of new dealer and they had a   thunderbird   the next day i went to see after school   i loved it   i bought it one the spot   pros the car has great acceleration that never dissapoints me   it is a sports car with luxury   which is what i really love   when i want a sporty looking car its there and when i needed a car to look nice in for the prom    my thunderbird was perfect   the front seats are roomy especially the passanger seat   my cousin with a broken leg had plenty of room with her leg straight out   the back is very large and comfortable   i have contemplated sleeping in the car already though the leg room could be better for such a long car i love the fact that i can set the temp i want in the car   cons the only thing i wasn t crazy about was the fact that you don t have a vent button its either windows    air   or heat this car keeps me in high status with friends   
872,1,  i bought my   t bird back in   it had    miles on it   the reason we bought the car was i like the looks and the way the car performed and my wife loves the interior and the power the car has when she sticks her foot into the v engine   i also love the car for it s ride and it s handling it has a tight turning ratio for a car of it s size and the speed sensitive steering feels great also   i also like the fuel mileage i get   mpg and on a   mile trip the car got   mpg and for a car that size with a   hp v i was very happy   about the only thing i don t like about the car is that it s not very good in the snow but with the right tire s it s not to bad   the car now has    miles on it and it still looks and drives like new i always keep the oil and filters changed and being an auto detailer i keep the car polish and waxed   for who should buy it   someone that likes a car that is comfy and the performance of a smooth v engine and handling to match   who not to buy   people that hate to drive in the snow     
873,1,  my thunderbird was the first car i ever bought on my own   i test drove it straight to the bank   i bought it used in june of    the seats wrapped around me like a glove   the car looked great   drove great   when i bought it   it had    miles on it   perfect interior   few scratches   this was luxury for me   it had automatic driver s seat   wonderful interior lighting   and rode like a dream   i also have a child   who rode in a car seat at the time   and i never had trouble getting her in or out   i never had any trouble out of it   other than the transmission needing a rebuild in august of    i absolutely loved this car   there wasn t a thing i didn t like about it   at very high speeds no   my daughter was not with me instead of shaking or floating   it felt like the car sat down and hugged every curve   my husband routinely drove it to his fire and rescue calls because it was faster and easier to handle than his truck   i   being stupid   decided that i   had   to have a truck   and a brand new one   at that   so   i traded it in october     trust me   i would kill for another one   maybe a super coupe this time   i ended up giving back the new truck that i had to have because i couldn t afford the payments anymore   i am still kicking myself   because my t bird would have been paid off in july of this year  
874,1,  this truck is the best vehicle that i have ever owned   my truck has    miles on it and never had a problem with this vehicle   i have put two sets of tires on the truck   the first set i put on were cheap tires so i went back to the stock firestones that it comes with off the assembly line   i have the   l engine   the engine is a little on the slow side but it runs great   it does have some decent power for its size   i would highly recommend this truck to anyone that is going to buy one   and just for some more reference my father owns the   xlt and it has    miles on it and it runs like a top     
875,1,  i recently bought my from a used car dealer   i love it   it has the    liter v    it goes through tires with me like i drink water   it has enough bed space to haul just about anything you can think of   this truck is two wheel drive and it cranks out power   they are relativly easy to work on   i have hauled a    rabalo with it   the down side is the space you have on the inside   i f you are clostraphobic   get an f    i am    and have no room   other than that   i love my truck br br  
876,1,  talk about a nobrainer   has some pretty good stuff out there and has been around for a long time as a leader in car productions   i bought my a year ago and is been a great   fast   sporty   trustworthy truck   i have just the basic stock   cyl   standard   anti lock brakes   and a c   you do nt need more than this to be pleased with the car   but if you want speed   go for the splash   they have a    l v   and they haul   over all are one of the best compact pickups for the dollar   the one and only down side is they re just what they re called   compact   if you re tall or need some extra space for cargo   get an extended cab for sure because there is no room in a single cab     
877,1,  want a valuable truck without the gas guzzling   buy a   this is my second and i haven t even parted with my first my original   has over k miles and still runs like new   i just bought the   for a fresh start but i will keep the   for work purposes in both models gas mileage is excellent   out of the   years i have owned the   i only had to pay for general maintenance   the only downfall is that it lacks in power   it takes a little to get the speed up there but hey at least it helps from not getting any speeding tickets if your in the market for a light duty inexpensive truck that will last a long time   i recommend highly checking out a and talking to other people that own one br br  
878,1,  i am a big fan and i have done some serious research on the new     i learned that has come up with a new trim package called the edge that falls between xl and xlt packages   with this extra package a customer now has much more options to choose from   with this new package   is adding special features in hopes to satisfy the needs for the young and active customer    quot what makes the edge so different from other quot   you might ask   well   to start off the   wheel drive edge has the same amount of ground clearance as the   wheel drive   this feature allows customers to have the x looks without the high prices   fog lamps   bed rail protectors   and front tow hooks are equipt as well   air conditioning and a cd player also come standard in the edge package with a   disk changer optional   the    liter engine comes standard in   wheel drive with your choice of regular cab or super cab and style side bed or flare side bed   i currently own a   trailhead that shares many of the same features as the edge   including the x look   i am completely satisfied with the power and performance that it provides   although the x lifted look causes a slightly rougher ride   it is well worth it just to have the   quot built tough quot   look that it has br br  
879,1,  i have never been so in love with a vehicle   i just bought a used   explorer xlt in wedgewood blue and it doesn t everything but brush my teeth for me b interior   the interior is roomy without feeling like a huge machine   everything you need is comfortably within reach and intuitively placed   no looking in the glove box to find the fuel door like on my      the fan set on the coolest setting is just as cold as if the a c were running   the seat has several electronic controls for the perfect fit   the passengers in the backseat have access to climate control and radio adjustments   the trunk   however   is the best part of the interior   it has it s own floormat    what a riot   there is an exceptional amount of space and a clever roll out shade to conceal expensive items from potential thieves b exterior   i find that the explorer is attractive but modest   i think the two tone paints gives it extra class   i highly recommend the running boards   at     i need the boost   i m also enjoying the motorized sunroof   while i am still adjusting from driving a small sedan   i don t have trouble fitting into tight spots or trying to park   the explorer is a nice compromise when it comes to size b the rest   true   gas economy could be better    i get   miles to the gallon and drive a mixture of highway and city miles   however   i don t find that to be unreasonable for the type of vehicle it is   the v engine is responsive and gives the vehicle all the get up and go it needs   it can definitely get out of its own way   the handling is smooth and does not feel tippy at all   i drove a tahoe once at thought i d roll at any moment for anyone looking at used suv s   i highly recommend you test drive an explorer   don t be distracted by the fancy looks of the xterra or the image of the jeep grand cherokee   the explorer is the best value for the dollar in terms of performance   comfort   and size   and they look good   too  
880,1,  this is one of the best cars that has ever made this   taurus has been a great family car for us since we bought it we ve put over    miles on it and it s only been in the shop once for minor repairs it has been a very dependable car throughout the years there have been a few recalls on it but they were not major ones overall this taurus has lasted us longer than any car we have ever owned it s great for driving in snow and on ice has lots of moving room in car the engine and transmission is still going strong without any problems i use to hear and read many reviews on a taurus about how they were the top seller every year and i strongly agree with that i love the power steering cruise control and the front wheel drive i will always stick to buying a taurus because it s worth every dime   i highly recommend anyone out there that is looking for a dependable and long lasting car buy a taurus because they keep going going going br br  
881,1,  i bought my   taurus from my parents because the prize was right and i knew who owned the car before me   i have had nothing but problems with this car     the light blue paint on the   taurus is defective   it will rust leaving you with a nice tri colored automobile     the air conditioning is famous for breaking and for a mere grand   you can fix it     there is a problem with the for the windshield wiper so it can come on an off when you operate the turn signal   i have owned a   taurus as well and encountered exactly the same problems   i will never again own a taurus   my parents recently purchased a   taurus and immediately it began making noises and the dealer essentially said   quot deal with it quot   if you are looking for a reliable used car from the early   s   do not buy a    or    taurus br br  
882,1,  this is a wonderful car   i bought mine as a used car and it was still in wonderful shape it has way over   thousand miles on it and it still runs like a dream   this car doesn t require much maintnence   does good on gas   and oil   has good   quot get up and go quot     runs smoothly when going down the road at any speed   this is a must buy car   if you are looking for a good car choose this one it also has plenty of space in front and back seats   most have options such as power seats   power windows power steering and more i really can think of nothing negative about this car   i really enjoy it   parts are easy to get at any car parts place   also parts are not very expensive to aquire br br  
883,1,  i own a    explorer xlt that s in the body shop for two weeks   the other guy s insurance is renting a new explorer xlt for me until mine is done    check out my review of the    model     life with explorer   all i can say is   i m impressed has the good sense to be content with minor tweakings of the very popular explorer   this latest incarnation of the xlt version is certainly evolutionary   but not revolutionary compared to my middle aged    model the outside stylings are more angular   with a front face that looks modern   yet also is somewhat reminiscent of the   aero era   headlight design that almost all cars had in the late   s   particularly the t bird and the model i m driving has spotlamps in the bottom of the outside mirrors   when the doors are unlocked with the key fob   these outside lights    along with the interior dome lights   turn on the first thing i noticed when entering the vehicle   is the redesigned door handles   they no longer pull up   rather the whole handle pulls straight out   sort of like an old latch refridgerator   the keyless entry keypad is now arranged vertically on the door   aft of the window   on the inside   the door locks are no longer stalks on the top rear of the door   but are now toggle switches near the inside latch handles the mirror controls threw me for a moment   rather than the slide selector   you now turn a knob to select which mirror to adjust   the tilt wheel adjustment is a fiasco   and so far the only thing i don t like about the     it s a large lever that must be turned   degrees to adjust the steering wheel   and must be manually returned to the starting position before exiting the vehicle   or else you bang your knees on it on the way out the radio   cd   a c controls are very similar to what i m used to   the dashboard   while still functional   clean and uncluttered   uses an odd   italic   font that i don t like as well as what i m used to   but that s purely subjective there are better cupholders   and handy bin for fries or sunglasses or a cellphone in front of the cavernous bread box of an arm rest bin   there is a power outlet in front of the bin   which helps keep phone charger cords out of the way   there is also a power outlet in back   for the kid s cd players    gameboys   the tissue dispenser had been eliminated   but a large clip is on the underside of the bin lid to hold the tissue box there   it s easier to change tissue boxes   but not as easy to access the tissues when driving   for those of us with small kids   that makes a difference   to the rest of you it s probably not anything to write home about the outside temp and compass have been moved from an overhead display to a small display that s part of the electronic odometer   it seems this has eliminated the tendency of the old design to register higher than the actual outside temp on very hot days   this was due to the old design s thermometer being influenced by cabin heat the rear storage area has more useable floor space   because the rear wheel wells are not as intrusive compared to older explorers   also   the retractable cover is situated higher   allowing room for taller objects to be carried and still remain hidden under the cover   it appears the tailgate window no longer opens independently from the rest of the gate   i found the ability to just open the window very handy   especially when loading groceries i have not attempted to use the rear seat   although just knowing it s there is nice   there are occasions when seating for five is inadequate   it s a nice option for those of us who dread a minivan   especially if seating for five is adequate more than    of the time the model i m renting has a v   engine    which provides plenty of zip from a both a dead stop and for freeway passing power   my truck has the big v   and while it s acceleration is not bad   it s clearly not in the same league as the new model   the engine runs quietly   and the transmission shifts smoothly   when it should   the wd drive system retains the   auto    high    lo   selector   although it has changed from a dial to a three push button arrangement the ride is much more car like than in my     there are fewer bounces and it s relatively quiet   there is some roll when cornering sharply   but that s normal for truck based suv  
884,1,  i recently used a   explorer xlt for a week and i really enjoyed driving it   the instruments and front passenger area is very well laid out   it drives very well and it has plenty of space for a wide variety of things   the cupholders and nic nac trays are easy to access and the stereo is easy to use and figure out   i don t really like having a third seat in this vehicle   as the seat seems kind of out of place   i would think if you haul around that many people   you probably need a suburban or an expedition   i would prefer a more level   and taller   storage area   with the third seat laid down   the storage area tilts down toward the tail of the vehicle and it seems a little awkward the model i drove had leather seats   a cd tape player and it had keyless entry   i like having keyless entry and i especially like the ability to open the back hatch with it   the leather was very new and it seems a little   tacky   but i am sure it will break in and smooth out   this vehicle seemed to have lots of options   cruise   leather   keyless pw   pdl   fog lights   thermometer and compass on the dash   but i would like to see heated seats   cold leather is the worst    i have heated leather in my   pathfinder i found the explorer to handle very well in the rain and the steering cornering feels very smooth and manageable   the explorer also has a tight turning radius   which really helps around town   it turns considerably sharper than my pathfinder   i don t know what wheel tire combinations you can get with the explorer   but it seemed like it wasn t really designed as an off road vehicle   maybe bigger tires would help   it is more like a big station wagon that handles well and has wd for driving on snowy roads   my pathfinder feels more like an off road truck and i enjoy using it on the back roads and in the woods   but i would be afraid to go to many of those places in the explorer since i am one of the few people who actually use my suv off roading   i would think the qualities that i don t like should attract a lot of   soccer mom   types who enjoy a stable ride with lots of room and excellent function my friend has a   explorer and i have to say that this new version drives better and is probably more versatile it s people hauling ability  
885,1,  i purchased this windstar in february    i just put    miles on my   windstar sel after returning to michigan from florida   it s a very comfortable ride with an excellent suspension   high

activated   an electronic compass   external temperature read out   automatically dimming rear view mirror   trip timer   engine message center   and low tire inflation sensors   i did not opt for the entertainment package with the    lcd viewer and the vhs dvd player this van came with the keyless touchpad entry feature on the driver s side door   daytime running lamps   and quad seating with a third bench seat   the exterior color is a two toned with a deep   emerald green and lower gold accent trim   the interior is a dark parchment with cloth seats and wood accents trim   the only difference between this sel and the limited series were basically the solid paint schemes   leather   heated   seats and wood accented steering wheel whereas chrysler offers their minivans in two basic body styles a short and a long wheelbase   the windstar comes in the long wheelbase model only the windstar has surprisingly quick acceleration   maneuverability is so so with the long wheelbase   the ride is very comfortable and quiet   the van holds the road very well and handles wet   slippery roads easily with the long wheelbase and the traction control   entry and exit is very good   the engine is loud if you floor it   but under normal driving conditions   the van gives a fairly quiet ride the windstar has many niceties including a small shelf to hold things like a cellular phone   a center console with cup holders and storage for cds and cassettes   holders in the driver and passenger doors for maps and other stuff   and a pull out shelf with two more cup holders   the overhead console provides very good interior lighting   a mirror to watch the kids sitting behind you   a compartment for eyeglasses or keys   a coin holder   a holder for a remote   and   as a really nice touch   the top of the dash is textured to eliminate glare and reflections off the dash onto the windshield   an extra power outlet is in front by the passenger side and a rear power outlet is at the liftgate   the two middle seats have cup holders and the rear seats fold down for extra room for cargo   the two middle seats and the third bench seat are removable   the third seat has little hooks in the back to hook the handles of plastic grocery bags into to keep the bags from moving around and spilling their contents   i also received a cargo net for the rear to keep items from shifting   the built in homelink remote on the driver s visor easily adapted to my garage door remotes   the visors have lighted mirrors   interior cargo space is very good   allowing me to remove the back seat and put in several pieces of luggage   a bicycle   and scuba gear including two air tanks   i had to pack everything carefully   but it all fit nicely however   the third bench seat weighs approximately   pounds so it can be a two person job to take the third seat out and put it back in   fuel economy is somewhat disappointing   my fuel economy with this windstar averaged    mpg with   octane mid grade fuel   economy is a little less at    mpg with premium   octane fuel   the windstar s v   engine is more than adequate for mountainous driving   i was impressed with the van s performance on interstate   driving through the appalachians   braking is adequate enough to quickly decelerate the    van   in my opinion   i m not a professional driver so i can t honestly evaluate   in technical terms   braking characteristics   the anti lock brakes do work and keeps the van under control and from skidding   when the anti lock brakes take over   you ll see the icon appear on the instrument cluster and the brake pedal will pulsate   you ll also hear an unsettling grinding or crunching noise   but this is normal   also   when the front wheels start to spin and the traction control activates   the traction control icon appears on the instrument cluster and again   you ll hear that unsettling grinding or crunching noise   but again that is normal   the traction control can be manually disabled by the driver the automatic transmission shifts smoothly and unless you re looking for for it   you can hardly tell when the transmission shifts up or down   the transmission can not be disengaged from park until the brake pedal is depressed and held   the road noise is low inside the van the van seems to collect road grime   salt and slush on the rear window so i find myself using the rear wiper and washer frequently   this is my first van and i think this is inherent with all vans and suvs a well equipped windstar costs about as much as an upscale luxury sedan but is much more versatile while retaining many of the luxury features   i wish would jazz up the pedestrian instrument layout and dash   i also noticed that water will fall on the door controls if the windows are cracked open while i am driving in rain   overall   i m very satisfied with the windstar   it has lived up to nearly all my expectations   except fuel economy   if ever builds these windstars with all wheel drive   then the explorer will be in very big trouble  
886,1,  i drove this van for nearly a year after my first car got stolen   and let me tell you   what a piece of work   i proceeded to drive it like a nascar   but it held up   with a spectacular v engine supplying all of the horsepower i needed for my various missions   let s talk about interior   this beauty had everything   mood lights   fully reclining seats   a fold out bed in back   a cooler   curtains   and a cable tv hookup   among various other things   in essence   it was   a van of the gods   with no other vehicle before or since   with the exception of my cadillac   even coming close to matching its splendor and pure sex appeal   it was asthetically marvelous   with boxy but smooth lines   and a ladder on back in case you had to get up on the roof for something   don t turn corners too fast   or it will tip over   if all of this doesn t make you teary eyed with joy   you are either a   an alien   or b   a communist   plus it has alloy wheels   and you can install tables in the middle and back seat rows   if anyone ever claims to make a more feature ridden behemoth   they are lying   a definite buy  
887,1,  i have always though of as a crappy   non reliable but ther explorer seems to always be good   what do they do different i have no idea   i love this car though   it drives great and it could very well be the top truck in the country   atleast in my eyes it could be   i recommend this truck to everyone and it is a pretty good price also   it drives great on rough terrain   i go out to cape cod and bring this truck through the beach and it drives great through there   i am telling you   this car is awesome   if you are smart you will listen to me you may think like me and say    quot   is a crappy i m not buying form them quot   but this is one hell opf a truck   and i suggest you get it br br  
888,1,  we are the proud owners of a   explorer xlt   we purchased it because we wanted a vehilcle that can handle western new york winters   carry two adults and two older teenage sons   and pull a large   quot pop up quot   camper trailer   at the same time   i didn t want to sacrifice gas mileage as you do with larger suvs   so far   we have been quite pleased with the explorer   it pulls our trailer   about   lbs   without a problem   with only some loss of gas mileage   when not towing   gas mileage averages around fifteen miles per gallon   or slightly better   although it doesn t have the soft comfortable ride of our old    crown victoria   the ride quality is pretty good   with the sohc v engine   there is some noticeable engine and road surface noise    nothing more than you would expect with a truck the vehicle handles very well and is easy to park and maneuver in parking lots   after driving an extended    aerostar mini van   the explorer seems much smaller and easier to navigate   however   we do miss the third passenger seat and the additional cargo space of the larger aerostar   but   we have taken several longer trips    or more miles   with the explorer and have managed to have enough room for luggage   cooler chest   christmas packages   etc   when my wife are using the vehicle around town   we love it for size and convenience there has been one recall so far    replacement of the secondary hood latch which was handled promptly by the dealer   just last week   we noticed that cold air seems to be coming in through the left rear door speaker   the dealer corrected this by adding insulation to the door   no charge   overall   the quality craftsmanship of the vehicle is quite good overall   if you want a suv that has decent gas mileage and is smaller than the expedition   excursion   or suburban   the explorer is a good choice   if you need larger towing capacity   or want more cargo capacity   then you will have to sacrifice gas mileage and go with one of the larger vehicles     update well   winter driving has arrived in western ny   and today i found out how well the explorer handles on slippery   snow packed roads   and i am very pleased with the results   on roads that were somewhat slippery for my aerostar   the explorer felt very stable and would not skid or fishtail when i pushed it a bit   so   i ll update this review again when i get a chance to play in some deep snow br br  
889,1,  i bought my eddie bauer edition of the explorer a little over a year ago and i love it more every day   this was purchased to replace an older car and a lot of thought was given to the suv vs car dilemma   i opted for the suv for the flexibility it offered ie hauling moving things without having to rent a truck   camping   etc i really love the luxury of the eddie bauer edition   the leather interior   great factory sound system   nice lines shape   it is wonderful to be able to see over traffic and not feel   quot boxed in quot   by larger vehicles   when i ride in a car now   i really feel like i m dragging on the ground   there are a couple of downsides that i wasn t really aware of   but can live with   they are that unless you are riding in the drivers seat   it can feel like a fairly rough ride and when the streets are slick   it does tend to slide more than a car   this is controlled by just slowing down a little more than you might on normal street conditions safer anyway   this is one of the best purchases i ve ever made and definitely the best vehicle purchase of my life   i will most surely be a repeat buyer br br  
890,1,  my parents own a brand spankin new explorer and i can not believe the extra qualities it has compared to other suv s   my parents bought this vehicle because of its overall power and luxury   it has a big triton v   engine that provides enough power for this vehicle   on our explorer we have the eddie bauer package which adds more luxury inside of the vehicle which is almost to much to better   i think that the options this vehicle gives you are almost unreal   it also comes with a x package which is nice for the winter time or if you want to take this vehicle off road   i recommend this vehicle to every person looking to buy a very nice suv for a reasonably price br br  
891,1,  stright and to the point   for a wd station wagon it is great   i was a truck user and had been for years   thought it was time to move up to a suv   biggest mistake i ever made first lets talk about the great things that the explorer is   it is a great family car   it has a super ride   the interior is very plush   the sound system beyond anything i ever needed   the handling and ride superb   lots of cargo space for luggage for trips   or for carring the groceries   now do nt try to help someone move with it because all your going to put in it are the small boxes   i used mine to help my daughter move from one apartment to another   way to many trips   took forever   own a home and need to do some lumber hauling   golly don t want to get wood slivers in that nice carpet or just ca nt get that   x   sheet of plywood in the back   i would highly recommend this suv to anyone who is looking to buy a station wagon or a really nice family car br br  
892,1,  iu think that the explorer should atleast have the    mark on this chart not the    that like a b   and i personally would give it a a   its one of the smartest   i purchased my explorer on jan    i have had it a year already and i have to say its excellent it rides like a baby and i love that   i truly would recomended this car to anyone who wants something that will last practically forever and very dependable on the road i enjoy my x espicailly when i got exactly what i want for only     for it    get one today you ll love it    you will be very safe in it in all the crash test i ve read   companies said it was a   quot excellent quot   and   said quot good quot   and   said acceptable and other than that no poors or marginal that s great   i want something that is safe and well assembled   very carefully put together get one today br br  
893,1,  i recently purchased the explorer and quite honestly have never been more satisfied with a vehicle purchase as i am with my explorer   upon my test drive of the explorer i noticed a very highly detailed interior which is both driver friendly and easily navigated   i was very pleased the with the power in take off as well as the vehicles ability to pick up speed once already moving   the seats are comfortable and adjust easily   one concern would be the history of the manufacturers past failures   but to this point i am thoroughly satisfied   the capability of this vehicle to corner is also very surprising suv s are known to be dangerous in higher speed maneuvering but the explorer and has seemed to located and lock in on the center of gravity for this vehicle   this is definitely the suv all families or truck van enthusiasts should consider when shopping for a vehicle br br  
894,1,  the explorer is probably the most ideal suv manufactured today   it s the perfect size   both inside and out   i am a school psychologist who travels about a school district that is over   square miles   so i log many   many miles weekly   the explorer is very comfortable and easy to drive   the interior is nicely arranged with all knobs and handles easily within the driver s reach   there are also controls in the back seat for the music system and air conditioning and heating system   the rear cargo area is ideal for transporting my equipment and testing kits   leaving the back seat for passengers   of course   one drawback is the tendency for this vehicle to roll over in an accident   but it is equipped   standard   with two airbags and seatbelts   which should be worn at all times   on the positive side   the explorer rates very high in overall safety and in crash tests   the drivers and passengers in the explorer have fewer injuries and deaths than most other vehicles   i drive mostly highway miles   but i find the gas mileage to be very competitive with more economy minded vehicles   it requires very little upkeep maintenance and retains its   resale   value very well   for the money   it s quite a bargain br br  
895,1,  when i buy a vehicle   i start with the purpose i want it to fulfill   then i look for vehicles that can handle the intended uses at a reasonable price and in a reliable manner   i wanted a vehicle that could carry a fair amount of cargo in an enclosed space   could handle deep snow and slippery roads   and could tow a trailer or boat   i looked at the grand cherokee   runner   montero sport   and explorer as well as reading about others   the explorer had the most space   a convenient wd system   good towing capacity   a proven reputation   and the best pricing   when a dealership offered me    below invoice in an honest upfront manner   with     financing   that closed the deal one year and    miles later   i am still pleased   and my wife enjoys driving it also   it is a truck   but a very refined and well equipped truck   we have an xlt with    sohc engine and moonroof   i live close to the canadian border   it starts fine in    degrees   it drives well on unplowed snowy roads   and the anti lock braking system works as designed   driver visibility and maneuverability are excellent   better than i expected in an suv   we can easily carry groceries   pets   lumber   up to    sports equipment or whatever inside with plenty of space   we have towed heavy trailers for about   miles during the past year at highway speeds with absolutely no problems   thus   it has fulfilled our purposes we have had no mechanical problems   only normal maintenance   gas mileage has been    mpg   which is not good but about what most equivalent suvs also register   my only complaint has been that it is difficult to keep the underside of the vehicle clean during winter when snow   mud and salt splatter up underneath it   there are many irregular spaces between parts and panels where crud can get lodged   rust and corrosion would be expected to result   thus   i spray it clean often during such weather   the spare tire is also exposed underneath suvs do not get as good gas mileage and can not handle emergency maneuvers   i e   rollover avoidance   like a sedan   thus   they would not be my choice for a crowded commuter expressway   the explorer is not highly rated as an offroad vehicle   other suvs with a shorter wheelbase and more ground clearance may be better   but   if your purposes are similar to mine   the explorer would be a good choice to look at     
896,1,  woohoo   i love this thing   it s way better than my that i have   i have been driving my   explorer around quite a bit lately and i ve noticed that i can hit curbs   i can drive through the snow at speed limit   i can run of squirrels and not notice them   i could probably even take out a frew children in a school parking lot and never know   however   i wouldn t exactly call that a selling feature it s got some amazing pickup   it s v   makes it faster than my in pickup   but not in the long run   it would kill my car off the line   snow is not a problem for this beast   i ve been driving in some great michigan snow so far this year and i haven t slipped at all   now   one issue is getting hit from the side   well   i m absolutely positive you d do a rollover if hit from the side   this thing almost rollsover when going through mountains after being hit by a heavy sidewind   it s big   but it doesn t have a very good center of gravity   thus making it an easy target to rollovers or other problems   but   if you get hit head on   or from behind   you will more than likely live   with it s cushy seats and major safety packages   it s also fun to play with   i love the little thing that tells what direction i m going in   normally called a compas   but it s just a thing when it s in a vehicle   i guess   it also tells you the temperature outside   the heat comes on really fast   it has all kinds of cool little things i can do with the seat   including tilting and deciding how high i want the seat   and how soft i want it   really cool i definitely recommend this baby   go buy one right now   don t look at anything else   especially the     it s flawed greatly and i know   i own one    br br  
897,1,  the key to a   good   explorer   is to   explore   the history first   know what you re buying   people   i currently have   and change on mine   check with carfax regarding the car s history   if the dealer will not   go elsewhere   is known for quality   so they claim   so this should not be an enormous undertaking for them to do so   s ultimate motive is to sell   sell   sell   like everyone else   customer service should not lag behind   unfortunately   it has for me   if the cs was even adequate i would have gladly put up with the little problems i have endured   my rear windshield wiper has a mind of it s own   so does my fuel gauge   it has become mandatory for me to reset my trip odometer and fill up every   miles   easy enough to remember   said they will be happy to do an   exploratory   check on the problem   there word really   to tell me it s a    problem   i know   it s like that everywhere   all the same it s still irritating   as the mechanic said this with a snicker   and no not the candy bar   for me   the problem is not the vehicle   it s the people selling and fixing the vehicle   fortunately   the selling is over on day one   it s wise to make friendly with your local mechanic down the road   trust me   the vehicle i own is of the   sport   breed   it fits me perfect   i am    on my tippy toes   nice headroom   leg room   hip room   etc   rear seat room is sufficient for short trips   knee and hip room lack   but i don t have much need for the back seat   well   ya know what i mean   with the seats folded flat   very nice for hauling pretty much anything you desire   i am not one for third row seats anyway   they tend to limit the second rows knee room   and see very little use anyway   for all you   owners with your third row seats they are of course not leather   come on   you re selling your top end eddie bauer and limited models with leather   while using vinyl for the third row seating surface   i don t know about you   but if i am paying   k and up   that would not fly with me   vinyl   anyway   back to my ride   great acceleration   awesome   speed tranny   take a spin   people   in a   speed automatic   and you will instantly appreciate your explorer that much more   above average suspension   very good brakes    abs   fuel economy is not all that   but i and you should expect that in any suv   a bit on the tippy side when strong winds are a blowing   minnesota winters can be nasty on occasion   and when it s windy be on alert   this of course   carries over from the bronco ii model   an explorer sport is basically a revised bronco ii   which were known for there compulsion to do the   wheel tango   a bit more stable with this model however   the side step rails that come with the sport model do tend to rust   i suggest waxing those while you re waxing the body   it may help a little   i was considering the purchase of a new   explorer sport after thinking back on the lack of cs   i quickly came to my senses   on the    model   i just can t get passed the plastic bottom   i realize most cars are plastic in this area   but at least they are painted plastic   call me picky   it just looks cheap   and now is cutting costs even more by moving to a plastic fuel door   to which was once metal   i am sure has stocked up on there inventory of this part   very easy to snap off if one is not careful filling up there tank   one last thing   s extended warranties   i did not purchase one with mine   here is why   i previously purchased a   gt with k on it   three years old at the time   problem after problem   my fault for buying a used    car   i know   but   there were so many problems   and not one item was covered under the warranty   it is safe to say   if you decide on purchasing an extended warranty from   mine cost     it will cover the engine   the tranny   and the drivetrain   that is it   everything else is thrown under   wear and tear   be prepared for a few headaches if you need to use it   not to mention trying to get a loaner car from   holy nightmare   six times in   months i was in for repair   nothing covered under warranty and i had to call at least   days in advance for a loaner car   not to handy when you need repair asap   is it again   it s wise to make friendly with your local mechanic down the road   unless can improve greatly on the cs this will no doubt be my last   for me   quality in the vehicle is equal to quality customer service   love the ride   just not the ride to the dealership  
898,1,  i purchased my   explorer   x   suv in may   i have had severe back surgery and needed something that was elevated in height so i could get in and out easily   i needed something that was big enough in the back seat where my two small children wouldn t constantly complain   quot he she is touching me quot   the seats fit my back wonderfully and there is so much room in it not only in the front   but in the rear passenger area   now   let s talk about the cargo area   when i go to the sam s club to purchase bulk items   i don t worry about where i am going to put everything   there is so much room   plus i have the option of folding down one side   or both sides   of the rear passenger area to make even more room   on one particularly lengthy trip   my husband and i folded down the rear passenger seat   spread out the children s sleeping bags and they were as happy as clams at high tide   i am absolutely thrilled with my suv br br  
899,1,  the   explorer sport is a fun   fairly affordable   and safe vehicle   it is easy to drive and rides very smoothly for a truck based vehicle   the inside is easy to use and looks nice   complete with fun and handy compartments and buttons   because there are so many options   it is very individual and suits personal needs   i bought the car over other suvs because of its wonderful safety records and have been very impressed with its performance since   contrary to belief about   door suvs   the back is very roomy and comfortable   it has everything i need br br  
900,1,  we bought the explorer because it had more room than the mazda protege we used to own   i absolutely love my truck   my husband and i bought it with all wheel drive all the time   i like the way it rides   it feels like we re riding on a pillow   the only complaint i have about it is that it guzzles gas   but that s because in order to get the all wheel all time you had to buy the v   the v has awesome pick up its the    engine that used to be put into a   it s a lot of fun to drive   the people who want to buy it is someone looking for a bigger vehicle   it may be a little more expensive than some other sport utility vehicle s   and that might make a person not want to buy it br br  
901,1,  i am a recent buyer of the explorer   and out of all the car s and suv s i ve had this has been the best one yet   it has an extremely smooth ride and gets pretty good gas mileage for an suv   best of all   depending on how you look at it   i was recently in a car accident with it   and by looking at the car   you would have thought i would have been seriously hurt   but i walked away with just a few bruises   the car has been repaired and it drives as good as ever   knowing what i know   i have much comfort driving   explorer has been good to me br br  
902,1,  first i must point out that the estimated price for this car is wrong   i own one and the base price with no options starts at      mine has every option except the leather which was a free option   but since i live in the heat and i hate hot leather on bare skin   i declined the leather   this car is made in very limited quantities of about   per year and commands a particulary aggressive type of owner   the car runs a    second quarter mile in stock trim and is good for about   mile per hour top speed   i put the vortech supercharger on mine the week i bought it as well as some aftermarket suspension parts from steeda   this was easily the best money i spent on the car as it only continued to get better   driving this car has got to be as fun as the owners of the original   thought   because not only is it one of the best looking american made cars on the road today   but it is also one of the fastest   i have had it to the drag strip three times now and have run a    et   mph pass with the stock tires on the car and a full tank of gas   now you heads out there do the math   at   pounds that makes this car a   horsepower monster   the fastest stock production vehicle on the road today is a twin turbo porsche   at      i own an american car that is a half a second faster at a mere savings of      now what could be wrong with that   but even better is the driveability and the mileage   on long freeway trips with the cruise control on i average    miles per gallon   that s   better then my wifes v taurus   you will be hard pressed to find a more reliable car with this kind of performance   at    miles i have changed the oil and the spark plugs only   that s it   no minor or major mechanical problems even with the aftermarket parts i have put on   this is indeed a fine example of american engineering and beauty   if you are looking at a used   or   cobra   i would encourage you to buy quickly   this car is a very driveable rocketship   a viper eating   porsche embarrasing american made musclecar that is as beautiful as it is fun   turns heads at every corner and the rear wheels at the drop of a hat   every stoplight becomes an adventure and every gas stop becomes a conversation   this car never fails to turn heads and on the rare occasion that you see another one the freeway   you are gauranteed to see a waving hand and a smiling face i ca nt say enough about this car except that i would buy it again today   even at full price   it is worth every penny   thank you  
903,1,  we own a   contour se equipped with the   valve v    the car was built in october   and we have put    miles on it since we bought it new we compared the contour to the honda accord and nissan maxima but found those models a little out of reach for our budget   we also drove the stratus   pontiac grand am   taurus   mazda   and the nissan altima   although those models were similarly priced   we did not feel that they could match the contour in drive quality   performance   interior ergonomics and exterior styling   we purchased the contour knowing that for less than     we were getting an attractive american car with the features we wanted   we made the decision that while the accord or maxima might have better build quality and lasting resale value we could not justify the    to    premium the car drives like a more expensive sports sedan   the smooth v   has a lot of power to offer at any speed and the suspension is tuned to give the driver a lot of confidence   the ride quality suffers as a result   but we knew it would   we do wish the car had more interior room   especially in the back seat   do not plan on taking long trips with adults in the rear seats   after   years we still have things to like about the car   but there are some things that must be considered if you are looking at buying one   we have gotten used to the ample power the v provides and the sporty handling   in addition   we still find it to be one of the more attractive cars in its class there have been numerous malfunctions that have required dealer service   has issued   recalls for this model for different reasons   the check engine light came on   but that is a common problem on all cars with current emission control systems   the fuel filler tube to the gas tank inexplicably became constricted to the point that it took   minutes to fill the tank   the most troublesome thing we have experienced is that there are pieces of trim that cover the jack points below the doors that will not stay on   we have noticed that there are a lot of contours on the road with the same problem   they cost roughly    each   all of the other problems were covered under warranty as annoying as any trouble with a new car is   we have taken it in stride   we still feel that the car was a good buy and plan to keep it until it has about    miles on it   you might not want to consider this car if you plan to put fewer miles on it than that because the residual value on contours is not good   on the other hand   if you can find a low mileage used one you might save yourself some money overall   i would say that we are happy with our decision based on the choices we had at the time   there might be a better model today   but put the contour on your list and at least give it a test drive br br  
904,1,  despite the criticism the contour has received   i ve found the car to be fast   comfortable   and a joy to drive   it seems that they got just about everything right in the    model year   and it missed the major decontenting that occurred in the    and   models   for just over     in early    my      i still think my k mile      contour se v was a great buy   the se trim level also features traction control   abs   and other features that are great in the winter   and aren t found on every car at this price level   i ve found it handles great around curves or daily driving   while acceleration is quick and responsive   i m sure the v helps in this regard   i ve never driven the zetec   cyl   but i understand some feel it s a bit sluggish in a car of medium size like the contour   whatever the case   the   horses put out by the   l duratech are plenty   and highway cruising   lane changes   and quick acceleration prove no problem at higher speeds   the engine is a bit loud   although many like it that way   so it s just something to consider   i tend not to notice as my upgraded speakers and subwoofer prove to be a nice way to drown out the engine noise   speaking of that   though   consider yourself warned if you plan on adding speakers or other upgrades   the contour isn t the easiest car to mess around with   each of the   stock speakers are in the doors   none in the rear deck like most cars   which means taking the entire door apart to replace them   routing wires and such is a bit of a pain as well   as has chosen looks   i e   concealing screws and wires in very difficult to reach locations   over upgradability   for most people who don t bother tinkering with their car   or who relegate that task to the specialists   it shouldn t even be an issue unfortunately   i can t give any hard info on reliability or long term performance   as i have only owned the car just less than three months   but in that time i have drove it regularly and its always performed as good or better than i expected   gas mileage is good   but not great   however this is my first car so i have no basis of comparison   however   i d say its probably about the same as most other cars with a similar sized engine   in the    mpg range   the   mpg highway rating from is probably a bit too optimistic the interior is quite comfortable   and the   way adjustable power driver s seat is a nice touch   a memory function would have been nice   though   the interior lighting is a little dim   the car would have benefitted from a centrally located   dome light   which i understand is on the mystiques and may have been on older model contours   rear seats   as most have said   aren t the most spacious in the world   but i don t see them as much of a problem at all   adults will definitely fit   although it may not be comfortable for very long drives   not really any different from just about any mid size car   though so   what are the real flaws   i haven t found any yet   besides the fact that   and especially the contour   doesn t have such a great reliability reputation   i haven t had any problems so far   however   and hope it ll stay that way   it s probably worth it   though   knowing that i saved a few thousand dollars over a same year import car   you know   those   reliable   hondas and toyotas   watch out for that depreciation   though   while it means i was able to get a great deal on the car to start with   it also means i can t expect much a few years down the line when it comes time to sell it   it s a trade off i m willing to take   though so yes   the car has its flaws   as you can see   though   most of them are relatively minor   and overshadowed by the car s great performance and price   after reading up on probably dozens of other contenders   i ve come to the conclusion that just about ever car in this price range will have a host of minor flaws and negative points   the   contour   of all the cars i have looked at   puts forth the best combination of looks   performance   and features with a minimal of problems for under     
905,1,  a little backstory   in my family   we buy cars out of necessity   in this case   the   chevy corsica had its last dance at the auto shop and was costing more than its utility   if on average i m spending more on repairs every month for the old car with no payments than i would on a newer car with the payments and higher insurance premiums   i ll dump the old one   time to shop   we found a   contour se with    miles on it   now   i knew of the horror stories about this car   the endless parade of recall notices and all of the repairs that follow   the guy who sold it to us   it was his father s before the he pasted away    and i think the family had more affection for this car than they did for the old man   had all of the service records showing that every recall   something like   or   of them   had been addressed and that the car was regularly serviced   i figured the rough patches in the car s history were over and that anything that could go wrong with the car already did   that was in march of    for two years and    miles   or k miles on the car total   we have not had any problems beyond the usual wear and tear   visits to the shop have been limited to routine maintenance   front end alignment and a new set of brakes and tires on the powertrain suspension   it s the se w   the    liter    banger   although the acceleration on the   cyl   w   auto trans   is relatively weak   it handles very well and the braking is superb   all contours have independent suspensions and rack    pinion steering   my se has the   in   alloys and   s all around   put them all together and it s like i m glued to the road   a word about drivetrain choice   the    i w auto trans    overdrive lacks punch in the low end   i can t be too aggressive getting on the interstate or weaving through traffic   i ve had this type of engine in another car   mazda   with a   speed manual   so i believe it s the tranny that s the problem   trouble translating those   horses to the tires quick enough   if i had my druthers   i would prefer the    liter   cylinder se or the svt   and   the combination of higher horsepower    horses in the svt   and the road handling of the se or svt would surprise most bmw   series owners   on style and fit   the   model look more like a shrunken taurus   than the econo box escort   overall the contour has very clean lines   even if it s a little generic   but   you can always tell the contour from the rear end   though   the light cluster and combination of reflectors and chrome reminds me of the lincoln continental   just shrunken down   the seats are supportive and   overall   the interior design is very clean   the flip down seats in the back and the roomy trunk are big pluses   too   i ve got my roadside repair kit   golf clubs and diddy bag back there   but   i still have room to go grocery shopping or mall hopping         side note   okay   you re asking   what s a diddy bag    it s the backpack where i keep a change of clothes   shower stuff   and my golf shoes   i confess    i m a horrible golfer   but rarely pass on a chance to play   with that bag in the car   my answer to anyone who asks is always   sure    i ll play       beyond being under powered   my only substantial complaint about the contour is the interior noise   the cabin has poor sound insulation    road noise is excessive   overall   overall   the car is a real prince   it has a charming personality with just enough styling   comfort and handling   it s a shame they stopped making these little go getters in the us   dumped the line and makes the mondeo in europe   the jaguar x type and the mondeo are both cousins of the contour   there are some notes about buying a used contour   though     take the se or svt over the gl or lx trim levels   the gl s and lx s that i ve seen   read about   and driven   seem chintzy inside and don t handle as well as either the se or svt     get the    liter   cyl   over the    i if you can   you will be so much happier with the added power     check the service records before you buy the contour   or any used vehicle for that matter   if you re buying from a private person and they don t have the maintenance records or can t tell you where it was taken for service   be very careful   something ain t right     get a warranty   if you re buying from a dealer   don t skip the extended warranty offer   and   if you re buying from a private person   check with the finance manager at your local dealership   like the dealer that maintained the car for the previous owner   to see what they will do to put you into one   at a minimum   think about getting an engine and drivetrain warranty to cover you for as long as you re making payments on the car   you will thank me later     be religious about vehicle maintenance   fords tend to be very spiteful when you neglect them   in another year   i ll be getting a new car   we have the mini van   see   chevy venture review   but we won t be getting rid of the contour   my wife will take it back and forth to annapolis and she insists that it will be the perfect car for our kids to have for their first vehicle when they get their driver s licenses   that s at least three years away   but so far   i can t say that i disagree with her  
906,1,  bought a contour se   january    decided to take it on vacation to maine   we are from branson   missouri   the contour was very economical   comfortable and a joy to ride and drive   the spunky   cylinder engine took the turnpikes like the big boys   was really impressed with the acceleration onto the ramps   the design of the windows lets you view a lot of the outdoors   which also made it very enjoyable   i would recommend a contour to anyone who appreciates economy   smooth ride   and sorta of a sporty look   i feel the   s certainly out number the   s   one of the   s is that there was some road noise   not really irritating   but had to turn the radio up louder than i m used to playing it   and another was the airbag light malfunctioned   we drove from eastern pennsylvania to home in one day    hours and because of the comfortable ride we arrived home not too tired and not at all beat up from the long drive   contour you have my vote and also my next vehicle will be a newer contour dwight rogers   branson   missouri   
907,1,  we bought a   contour in   and at first were so happy   it is a smaller car   but with   doors and a good sized trunk   it was roomy enough for our family of   at the time   then slowly things started happening   first the air stopped working   then we would get things in the mail every few months or so about a recall on the car   once it was the head lights   another time the breaks   and another time the air conditioner   the seat belts are constantly getting jammed and with   kids and a seat belt law   we need our seatbelts to work properly   was always happy to fix these things as the car is still under warranty   but it is just bothersome to have to keep taking it in and being without a car for a few days at a time     
908,1,  if had really taken this car under their wing   it truly could ve been the   world car   they were hoping it would be   but with ads seemingly only placed in   woman s day   and   parenting   magazines it s no big surprise sales were poor   in other parts of the world   namely europe   the mondeo   their version of the contour   has done reasonably well and the newest model has won accolades since it s inception   so   it is possible for to build a great car   but it seems recurringly impossible for them to bring it to the u s   without butchering it   with that in mind   you should definitely consider a contour if you happen across one during your search for transportation   understand   though   that it helps if you re a   car person   when you drive it   why   well   that s hard to explain unless you are a   car person   this car   in every trim level   handles like a dream   if you happen upon a   sport   model or   svt   you should definitely take it for a lengthy test drive   if you find a zetec   the   cylinder model   and it s a stick shift   play with it in the high rpms   the test drive will be more enjoyable and convincing if you can find a nice   twisty road to experiment on listen for things like engine howl or strange rubbing sounds coming from the wheel area   wheel bearings are a common failure on this car   as are water pumps   do your best to find out if the water pump has been replaced   if the car is over k miles and still running the original water pump   you may want to consider replacing it   they have a habit of breaking internally   which can result in engine failure if you don t catch it soon enough   i happen to own a contour with the zetec engine   i have replaced the water pump   but that s about it   the car is very comfortable on long drives and i really stress the engine everyday   with regular maintenance    notice i said   regular   maintenance   not    mile oil changes    the car should last you until you re ready for something else   take care of it and it ll take care of you if you happen to own one or are seriously looking to buy one   stop by contour org and visit us   that s the website for the contour enthusiasts group and we ve ran across and fixed almost every problem you could face on a contour   hope to see you there  
909,1,  i have leased a   contour gl for   years and will have to decide whether to buy or lease it or another car in october so i have been thinking about the car a lot   my model is a   door    cylinder automatic   with cruise   pw   a c   it has been an excellent car   no trouble for    miles   it handles very well   and i haven t seen the need for the available larger engine   though all the pro reviewers say the   cylinder larger engine is smoother   i used to have a bmw    and this car s handling is not as good as that   but it is better than my audi    for example   i know that the accord gets better reviews but i just ca nt complain about this car   it is quiet   and trunk space is excellent   the space in front is fine   rear is not huge but ok for kids or short trips with adults br  
910,1,  highly affordable   was a key factor in initial purchase   warranty very much considered as a premium value   appearance   comfort of ride and roadability   great selection of installed options   economic to operate   we have experienced   three recalls to dealerships   fuel filler neck would not accept fuel about the second week after we purchased the vehicle   dealership where we purchased the vehicle   disassembled the right suspension   exhaust   and fuel tank and we made about   trips to different dealerships trying to get noises created by the repair of the fuel filler neck   we finally gave up and we now here the noise when we descend across a flaw in the surface the road bed br br  
911,1,  best decision i ever made was begging for this truck for my graduation present   when i found it it had    miles on it and was sitting used on a new car lot   it was a   xlt   came with speed and    liter four banger   regular cab   longbed   and am fm stereo casette     split bench   and bedliner   not bad for   grand   all the goodies a college freshman could want   sometimes i wish for the    or    liter    but i m more than satisfied with the power my engine makes   it helps that it s a speed so that it s easier to make the most out of it the interior is great   comfortable   and i do nt ever want an aftermarket system because the   speaker   watt system that s stock makes good enough sound that i just added an rf modulated cd changer and will wait till i m making more money and have a new truck to make serious upgrades   you got ta put it on full blast to get any distortion   and the base is impressive   you d have to be blind   with no manual dexterity and fingers the size of pickles to have any problems operating anything while driving   in fact   i was able to memorize the dash layout so i can turn any switch without taking my eyes off the road in no time   the defrost works very quickly   you can see it start to kick in in a few seconds   i d like to see the cupholders placed differently   they sit at the base of the shifter   on the transmission hump   i have to reach way too low to grab sodas   i ve seen s s where the cupholders retract from the front of the center console   i d like to see that setup in the   i d also like a different manual door lock design   as it is you can t unlock the doors on a non power lock without opening the door because when the locks are down they are recessed all the way in their holes in the door and there s no way to pul them up without opening it   space is good for me at     quot   but it is not a truck for people above average height   i ve had passengers wish the seats had a few more degrees of recline   there s lots of storage with a center armrest doubling as a storage bin with slots for coins and a pretty big glove box i do nt know why peole complain so much about the    being gutless   get it to rev to the sweet spot between   and   rpm before you dump the clutch or shift in every gear and and those   cylenders pull pretty damn hard and i almost forget i m even driving a four banger truck engine till it runs outta steam after about   rpms and the engine whine becomes noticeable   part throttle at low speeds in first and second gear gives a healthy push   drive it right and it ll jump off the line pretty agressively   i know i ve certainly never had to beg my way off of an expressway onramp   of course i would never want this engine with an automatic highway passing though is a little different   if you don t need to pick up speed quickly at all   you ll get by in th most of the time   the engine will pull ok in th on flat or very slight grades   if you want to casually dart into the fast lane to make a pass and need to accelerate from maybe   or so to   or    you ll need th   but to really pick up speed fast   like from   or   to   or   and get out of a tight spot or jump into the fastlane without slowing anybody down you wo nt get any real acceleration above rd gear   but then again that s with most vehicles and i ve never found myself lacking for power when i really needed it the breaking is just as almost as good as on my parents   corolla   stops are short   without any fishtailing and not much nose dive   i ve had to do panic stops in rain and still never felt like the truck was getting away from me   handling is pretty good to   the firestones grip very ok   but i think i have the suspension design to thank for the handling more than anything else   ride is ok with big bumps or smooth roads   it s a whole lot of small bumps close together that upset it   the only time you have to be careful is fast bumpy corners or wet turns   where it reminds you it s a truck when the rear end does the jitterbug or slides a bit when unloaded   at speed the steering is accurate with little free play and nicely weighted   but in parking lots you ll have to twist it a few times to get out of tight situations   it s also extremely useful   though i have a base with pretty low payload it s hauled everything i ve ever needed it to   i somehow packed everything i own in it for the   hour drive to school   we chopped up a tree that fell in our lawn in the last storm and holled the logs away in only a couple trips   i even threw   cynder blocks in the back while making a quick run to home depo with a friend   through it all   with only the basic recommended maintenance   i ve had no engine problems whatsoever in the   plus miles i ve put on the truck   i get about   mpg in mostly highway driving   but i m   and have a leadfoot so do nt let that scare you real world range has stretched to over   miles with    gallon gas tank   anyone who drive like a sane person can probably expect closer to mid or high teens in the city and    on the highway there are some annoyances though    was a pretty bad year for elecrical systems so if you want a used get one from   on   interior light sometimes stays on for up to   minutes after i get out and occasionally stays on the whole time i m driving   wipers are posessed   sometimes they ve come on without me turning any switches   remember to put that parking break to the very very last notch before you get out and maybe even leave it in gear   otherwise it ll roll   armrest is starting to come loose from the seat   and the hard plastic steering wheel is very slippery   sliding right through the hands in tight turns   the bedliner has started to loose it s grip on the bedrail in a couple spots   the latch meckanism on the sliding rear window can be flimsy   i ve locked the keys in the truck and been able to get in with a screw driver   so you might want to put a lock on it or look for one without it if security is a concern   i really wish i had gotten one with air   i think more should be standard in the xlt package basically i love this truck   all the important things are done right   there s just some minor annoyances that i can easily live with   good   economical   useful   stylish transportation since i got it i have added a   disk cd changer and various cosmetics such as body color matched tail light covers   blacked out headlight covers   ventvisors   bug deflector   shade blade   and soft tonneau cover   some know what all that stuff is and some don t but suffice it to say when i learned about the huge custom product market available for puckups i went nuts and i probably still haven t finished update this is an update to a december opinion i wrote over a year ago about my new   it s been    miles and the engine has performed almost flawlessly   it s only hiccup was a winter day in subzero temperatures in which i stalled by slipping the clutch too quickly and it took a few tries to get it started back up   other than that i m never disappointed when i turn the key and have never been left stranded there are some annoyances   some small   some large   my temperature gauge dies on me at about    miles   usually when this happens it s a sensor that must be replaced for about   dollars   it s extremely rare for the actual gauge to die   lucky me   the dealer quoted me   dollars to replace it   that will have to wait   it does not affect how the engine runs so i will have to do without it because that s alot to a college kid the brakes needed to be replaced at about    miles   a little earlier than what i m used to but then again i do tend to drive like teenager because that s what i am   i also had to make a few panic stops   so i had the pads replaced and the shoes remachined at pep boys   which seemingly did good work   their brakes seem to bite better and make for better stops than the units   though they were very good i didn t particularly like the firestones   which gave out too early in the corners and rode roughly   so i replaced them at    miles with goodyear laramie touring tires   which aren t well known but did a better job of smoothing the ride and sticking in the corners   the firestones weren t really done for yet but i happened to have money at the time and figured it would be wise to replace them when i could rather than wait till they were bald   when i might not have any money   ahhh   the precarious income of a college student on the inside the interior light goes off when it s supposed to about   percent of the time   and the rest of the time when it gets annoying i pull the fuse   a sensor in the door probably either needs to be replaced or cleaned off   also   the on off button on the radio no longer works properly   so the radio stays on all the time   the driver s side window squeaks when lowered   a lubricant will probably help the paint has held up very well   there is no fading or peeling   only the normal scratches and dings from everyday driving   the bad primer and flimsy finishes that plagued pre   is no more the best fuel range with the    gallon tank is now   miles   but i think there s the potential to do better and maybe surpass    i put fuel injector cleaner in with the last tank   i also think part of it is that i m a little scared to dip too far into that reserve past e   but i m gon na go for it and update on the mileage soon so aside from new brakes   which has alot to do with driving habbits   and new tires   which i didn t really need   this truck has not demanded any other money for the most part except for cool stuff i pput on to personalize it mileage update      i just finished off a tank that was about    highway city driving   i drove it from when the tank was topped off at    miles per gallon until past e with the fuel light on   for the best range yet of   miles   probably with a few more left   that s roughly   mpg   i know   i know   less than what most would expect from this type of truck   but keep in mind that s with my jackrabbit starts in the city and    mph cruising speeds on the highway   this tank looks even more promising   as it is at the half way mark and it s already taken me   miles or so   i expect low   s when i tabulate it   update   range this time around with    highway cruising at about   mph and around town driving came to   miles total exactly from top off until i lost my nerve after having driven several miles past when the low fuel light came on   the bed cover stayed down almost the whole time and i definitely thinks it helps me gain one or two mph   i m going to try to be even more conservative in my driving with this tank and see if i can break    i m thinking it probably won t get much better than low   s overall no matter what i do   maybe a k amp n filter will snag me another mpg   one thing s for sure   i don t know how those guys with the half ton and three quarter ton pickups deal with    dollar fillups once a week   update     miles     so far so good   no big problems   never any hesitation on startup   the clutch feels just as strong as new   i think they put particularly good ones on the manual transmissions in this truck   the parking brake has another inch or so of give when you put it on and realease the foot brake   the same minor electrical annoyances persist   the stubborn interior light   whose fuse was pulled   and the gauges that occassionally act up   though thankfully they stull are functional   there is some steering pull to the right under hard braking despite the fact that there are only    miles on the brakes and i got an alignment about    miles ago   fuel economy has stayed the same at about   mpg mpg   though i haven t gone from tip off to near empty in awhile so i m gon na try it again soo and see what happens   the check gauge light comes on quite often though i have it serviced regularly and nothing has been found wrong with the truck   really hard bumps seem to trigger it quite often    was such a bad year for electricals   the big    mile service is coming up   with belt replacements   inspections   etc   i may shop independant mechanics to get a better deal on the more expensive stuff   pep boys is a possibility   i ll report back on how smoothly it goes soon     mileage update i just went through another good full tank of    gallons for   miles   or about    mpg   with what seemed like a good    miles left   the fuel light had been on only a few minutes when i finally filled up   i think my numbers should have been at this level from the beginning but it has taken me awhile to get up the nerve to dip into that reserve past e and get as close as possible to an almost empty tank for an accurate reading without stranding myself somewhere   this tank was about a    mixture of hard accelarating jack rabbit starts and stop and go city traffic and    mph cruising on the highway with occassional downshifting to fourth   there were also ocasional traffic jams and highway slow downs   some have criticized my truck s mileage   but i think averaging about   mpg is pretty good for a lead footed pickup driver   i also think there was still a few miles left and believe i could have reached    miles total on this tank   for about   mpg   if i drove more gently at all times   which i am sure i probably never will    overall should be reachable     
912,1,  i have to say that the is possibly the best purchase i ever made   and i also have to say it was one of the safest i ever made   i had a   xlt   and unfortunately i wrecked it   it was a nasty accident   but i came out with only a scratch   so it gets my vote for safety i loved the truck because   though it was small   it served it s purpose well   and was never in the shop   it was incredibly reliable   the   l    cylinder   was a little under powered   though it got good gas mileage   the best i ever got was   mpg   i had an aftermarket exhaust on it   and i removed the intake silencers   which helped both power   and mileage   the   mpg was steady driving at    i ve heard that s a little rare   but if you don t mind going a little slower   and are gentle with the throttle   it s not out of the question the only thing i didn t like about the truck was the small cab   an extended cab would have solved this easily   the long bed would have been a little better for hauling   too   but with the standard cab   and short bed   i kept the weight down   which helps mileage   and helps the   cylinder get going a little better i would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a truck   they re stout   and are very reliable     
913,1,  i d been riding a motorcycle exclusively for eight years   when i decided the time had come to get back on four wheels for awhile   the mean streets of phoenix   arizona are not known for their kindness to two wheelers i had looked at a number of sporty cars   and i was also considering a pickup to help out with the household chores   after driving a bike for so long   the   fun factor   outweighed practicality and the truck idea was shelved the muscle car era was over before i got my first license   but there are still a few cars out there that continue to capture the spirit of the original pony car the   gt incorporates the long hood   short trunk style of the first      any   stang enthusiast will also recognize the channel extending from the front quarter panel to the rear simulated brake scoop on each side   the   dual cowl   dashboard and emblems on the seats also evoke memories of the classic ponies unfortunately   both the brake scoops and hood scoop are tacked on for show   while that previous era cobra jet could claim some performance gain from increased air flow   all these decorations get you is a more difficult time washing your car   water just loves to adhere to the hood scoop honeycomb front and release after the hood is dry   with typical arizona hard water   this will leave long water streaks for you to clean again   i find the    brake scoops overdone   while the previous years i found stylish there are   gt models   the deluxe and premium   i found the deluxe quite acceptable   and in fact have only one added option   the mach   sound upgrade   when i bought the car i wanted no options   but the only black   speed manual on the lot had the   sound system     stands for   watts peak output i must say   factory car audio has improved greatly since my last car   i m one who traditionally ripped out the factory system within days and replaced it with something listenable   i have no such desires after   miles of driving in my gt   with a   cd changer in dash   mp compatible   plenty of speakers and all optimally placed   i have enjoyed this system far more than any other i ve ever had   the dsp   effects   are worthless   but there is one set of modes i ve found invaluable   setting for   driver only    all seats   or   rear seats   really does work as advertised   and perfects the sound for those areas you won t be using   rear seats   much   unless you have a dog or children   the backseat does not have enough legroom for any normal sized adult   the driver seat is just big enough for my husky     frame   but i would imagine it s tight for those over    the driver s seat is powered and firmness can be adjusted   but it feels like a compromise    some comfort   some support the gt deluxe comes with    alloy painted wheels   this means a bit more care when it comes to cleaning them   but they look great   you ll appreciate them if you re a fan of curvy   mountain roads   abs and traction control also add to the feeling of control when pushing this car   but if you just   have   to do a big   tire smoking burnout and fishtail   you can disable traction control with a dashboard switch make no mistake   the gt is fun to drive   the dual exhaust provides a throaty   reassuring feedback whenever you step into the gas pedal   it is subdued enough that you won t be annoyed by it during everyday city driving   you can always crank up the tunes if you opted for the mach   sound   there is an even better mach   option i do have an unfavorable reaction to stoplights   with the hot summers and excessive traffic in phoenix   the asphault near stoplights is often heavily worn   startingly deep ruts appear in the road surface at times   while all vehicles have a tendency to follow these ruts   a biker s nightmare   the seems to me a bit worse than normal in this regard   it tends to show the most during a firm brake for a stale yellow light about    of my driving is stop and go   city traffic driving   i get mpg just about every tank   on a long trip i once broke    and the very first tank was   i am absolutely happy with this purchase   i love driving it   and i have been spoiled by seriously fun motorcycle driving   it looks great   and though the car gets it share of attention   you don t look like you re having a mid life crisis or compensating for something   i hope continues to manufacture this pony for a long time   as this style gets harder and harder to find   see camaro  
914,1,  i bought my   mineral grey gt at june st   i had owned a   gt and loved the performance for what is classified as a mid performance vehicle   when i bought my new car i expected nothing less   i have been doing a lot of city    highway driving and i must say that i m very impressed with the mileage for an eight cylinder   mpg   on a highway trip this last week   i averaged mpg with the ac running very impressive   on the performance side it s a bit too soon to tell   i like to break my cars in a bit and don t like to push them much before to first oil change   i actually bought this car for less than i paid for my    and it comes with a few additional features that the    didn t have such as traction control   anti lock brakes and a   disc cd changer   had don t a first class job holding the price on this car in the last four years   i honestly believe that this is probably the strongest contributing factor to the being the   ruler   of the performance car kingdom for the mid performance level cars   fords continues to improve this car at every turn   the quadra shock rear end design along with the other structural traction improvements to the rear end makes this car a good handler on the highway and on twisty roads   this car is significantly quieter and quite a bit more   sticky   on the road than my    too   as far as overall power   so far i m quite happy with the pick up   i have also noticed that the   sweet range   for this car is in the sixty plus mile per hour range   this is where i can definitely notice the additional horsepower over my    all in all i would have to say that this is my favorite of the two i ve owned so far  
915,1,  i am loving my   premium coup   i have the silver body with the dark charcoal interior   i must admit however   after owning a white   pony   i was disappointed to see the interior had not changed much at all   the same simple   plain interior options were a let down   in that they were boring   the interior seating has seemed to change   in that it is more plush and classier   i did not go for the leather   but i am thinking more   i should have   should seriously rethink the interior options via the dash   my   had an option where you could have the fan placed at your feet and upper body at once   that option is out in the    i will state i am in love with my sound system   for a factory system   it is not sheepish at all   it thumps base like i have    subwoofers and the   cd dash changer is also lovely   the options to customize your tunes and their sounds is also nice   the only drawback   assuming cassette tapes are not used as much   is the   model i have   does not come with a cassette player in the dash   the   model did   but it also had only   cd you could have in dash   i am the typical enthusiast   i love the throaty deep growl the car possesses and you can even get this without upping the extra     for the gt model   i like the smoother than normal ride for a sports car i get from my stang   but the rear wheel drive can be tricky   especially in rainy weather   the abs and tracking system has installed   kind of gives a little more peace of mind to the driver   i was also blown away at the horses on this engine   the v   is powerful   although not as powerful as a matched model of some other   pony   cars   but it is punchy   my   was a five speed   but i could only get the paint and interior i wanted in automatic   which does not totally disappoint   but take off can be draggy   this car seems more   sedan like   than the older models   the long hood is still there and i happen to like the over sized scoops on the premium coup models   bottom line   this is a sexy car that moves just as sexy   just be careful on the slightest curve   wear your seat belt   so you won t feel you are being thrown out  
916,1,  first of all   i live by myself in a dorm in downtown austin   there is little or no parking available where i live   and most of the places i have to get to are within walking distance   also   i have a couple of friends that always seem to be willing to drive me around   because of these reasons   i really have no need for a car i have owned a few   however   actually   it was mostly partial ownership   as my parents technically bought them and just let me drive around in them   i ve used these cars enough to form an adequate review   i believe   and that is what i intend to do right now the has always been a great looking car with relatively decent gas mileage   about the same if not better than previous   cylinder cars i have used   in particular   i love the    model s style when compared to the earlier and newest models   this body style will be a classic   for sure   passenger wise   it is a great single or two person road trip vehicle   in the three years that i had access to it   it proved itself to be very dependable and still ran great   in spite of having    miles on it   when we traded it in   i did not consider myself then   nor do i consider myself now a car aficionado by any means   but this was one of my favorites of the cars that i drove   my complaints are minimal   i don t like to drive fast   so the fact that it s   l engine doesn t have the sound or power of other cars didn t affect me much   although my   quot friends quot   made quite a joke out of it   it can still beat most cars off the line with a   speed manual   but drops into the backfield rather quickly   another thing i noticed is that bugs tend to take off too much paint on the hood and front bumper   not to mention the pealing and chipping of the paint right behind the wheel wells   mud flaps would dramatically fix this problem   the body dents very easily   which can be very costly to repair   the interior is not the quietest place i ve encountered   and the rattling and squeaking noises can be an annoyance   as the car approached the    mile mark   i began to get a little concerned about the rumors drifting around about head gasket problems on this model   but my fears were unfounded   the inspector didn t even find any minor gasket problems when we turned it in this car was bought for around     and it is certainly worth the money   as far as i am concerned   it may not be the fastest car on the road   but i loved this car and would recommend it to anyone who asks br br  
917,1,  a diamond in the rough   this car is a dream to drive power comes on smooth as silk and goes till u let um reving out at   rpms this little rocket gives more than enough power to pull out on the highway or cut some corners on your favorite back road   once in a corner u can grip the whell and push the peddle down till your nerves give in with no worry baout losing control of traction i have driven many sports cars includeing   chevy corrvetts years           all owned by my father and the probe gt may not have top end or pick of the beast of a car the vette but it sure can make u stay in your seat and hang on for your life in tight corners   
918,1,  i bought this vehicle primarily for the prestige and looks rather than reliability or rating   overall   i am happy with my   though she is and can be tempermental   i was amazed at it s affordability and comfort   i must stress comfort   the seats are perfectly contoured to my body and the steering wheel isn t one of those hard skinny ones   which i hate   when i get in it and start driving i feel like i could go on forever   you really must at least test drive one of these cars   your standards of comfort will be forever altered the overall vehicle is very easy to maintain with relatively few problems   my car has    miles on it now and i am just now having to replace a few parts here and there   nothing major or highly expensive   just a wheel bearing and the brakes from normal wear and tear the would even make a good car for the family   if you don t mind the two door as opposed to four door for loading the kiddies   the airbags are of the design that would not blow up in your face   but rather split down the middle   only the airbag itself makes contact with you   i know this from personal experience    the ride for the most part is generally smooth sailing   although being low to the ground   you really have to watch curbs and pot holes more so than in another vehicle   but   the looks alone would make up for that br br  
919,1,  i have been driving my   gt convertible v    for about   months   it is a beautiful car and a pleasure to drive with it s power and great handling   it is as fun to drive as it is attractive   it s a car that you can drive and actually enjoy yourself   ample room for four but small enough to fit in those all too prevalent compact car parking spaces now for the downside   in these   months of joyous driving   i have been hit   times   once i was sideswiped   twice i was rear ended at traffic lights and three times i was hit while parked or stopped in a parking lot maybe i have bad carma   but i really feel that a bright red convertible draws more cars to collide with them   it acts as a magnet to other cars bumpers another problem the car has is that in many    fords   the transmission has been known to slip an operation which costs about two thousand dollars to repair and i am currently undergoing the operation for the third time   this time under warranty   thank heavens so the transmission slips   and cars seem to flail wildly about when they are near this one but who cares   it is a beautiful car   made to run on   octane   which saves money and now is very inexpensive to buy   buy one   keep it for two years   and then sell it   just so you can have the experience of driving this fine piece of magnetic metal br br  
920,1,  my   taurus gl station wagon was purchased new in columbus   ohio   this vehicle has been a very solid   reasonably reliable hauler   the large and versatile cargo area adds incredible utility   enough to fit a full sized bicycle without taking the wheel off   the car is comfortable to drive   and the handling is really outstanding for its day   remember   this is the car that saved and wowed the world with its audi class handling and driving dynamics in    the hp   l vulcan v is rock solid   but delivers tepid acceleration   brakes   no abs available   are no better than adequate   but the car handles predictably even in adverse conditions   we ve used goodyear aquatreds   which certainly help in the wet and snow   highway ride is pretty good up to about mph   after which things become loud and jiggly   the speedo only goes to    after   years   this is not a speeder reliability and durability have been surprisingly good   but   this is a   and keeping up with maintenance is important or it ll come back to bite you   long term problem areas include   alignment issues   tires wear out rather fast in this heavy front drive car   issues with random stalling    but it always started up again immediately or within minutes   and coolant system problems   the car is not happy in continuous stop and go city traffic   and can overheat and spill coolant   rust is a big factor in the older vehicles   stay ahead of it   or it will attack doors and rear wheel wells   original generation tauruses are said to have problems with a c and transmission   a c no problems   but rarely used   but transmission has slow leak after    miles    and i think could be busted up much faster under hard acceleration   good news   parts are cheap and plentiful   insurance costs are low   the wagon has been used to tow a lb   trailer without issue personally   i think the original    models are the best looking wagons ever produced   the smooth   proportionate   aerodynamic shape influenced every car produced since   this car is still good looking after   years    people are amazed when i tell them how old it is   these days   a   taurus can be a good choice for either a durable   inexpensive beater or a piece of american automotive history note   my car has low miles     over   years   regular maintenance   and easy driving style  
921,1,  i used to own a   convertible but had a terrible experience with the dealership   not the car   and fortunately got them to buy the car back   it was that bad   i might review this experience in the section i decided to give a second chance and since in the meantime i had adopted a lbs   dog i decided to take a look at bigger vehicles   with the escape in mind i went to a different dealership   while leaving the lot to take a midnight edition escape i glanced at a bunch of little focus station wagons and finally left the dealer in one of those the dealer had none of these wagons with manual transmission   traction control or airbags   so despite the fact that i was willing to pay the extra cash for such features i had to leave the lot in an automatic focus ztw   this was way back in august and since the car is almost   miles old i believe i can make a fair review the car is very well equipped for the money   lots of space and nice unexpected features everywhere   although the engine power is rather modest the wagon is kind of fun to drive due to great on road dynamics   fuel economy not as good as advertised but pretty decent and improving with time   now its making about   mpg so far i have not experienced any of the problems and mechanical failures that many people have reported here   just a very annoying squicky noise in the rear that hopefully the dealership will be able to take care of when taken to the k service the front wheels are permanently dirty due to fast fading brake pads i suspect but so far the braking power has been adequate and enough i really like the instrumentation and the interior design   there is storage space everywhere in the cabin   inside   the car feels much larger than it actually is   the only objection to the interior would be that the seat cushions feels short   i am only    and not heavy and in long rides the seat makes its presence known   i mean a seat cushion is not something you should think about unless its really good   i don t want to think how a larger guy would feel after an hour in one of these my dog loves the car and hopefully the trauma of riding in the minimalist back seat of the is forgotten and forgiven the other day i was looking at a sales brochure for the european focus and couldn t believe how spartan the american version is when compared to the one over there   features like climate control   better headlights   chrome inside door handles   hood lock   backseats headrests   no wonder is the best selling car in europe the initial quality problems plus the failure to offer many of the features offered in europe cemented focus   reputation as a very unreliable cheapmobile   bad for and even worse for the owners whose resale value will be greatly affected   i own a   version in which most of the problems supposedly have been already addressed but i suspect that such fact will be of little help when the time comes to get rid of my ztw   in the meantime i am enjoying the ride and the money saved focus is a very good car that consciously failed to make a great car   only they know why  
922,1,  in   my husband and i   having just recently had a baby set out to get ourselves a new car since the    escort we had needed some work   not having a lot of money we decided to look at used vehicles   the car dealer had a few    aspires on the lot and we decided to try them we test drove a nice   burple   color one as it became known to us since the color was a cross between blue and purple   we went and talked price and drove away the proud new owners of a   door    aspire the interior of this car was roomy enough for our family of three   my husband is tall at over    and never had a problem in this car   this car actually seems bigger then the escort to us many people have complained about the power in this car   while we found that you could not expect      very quickly it did perform well enough for us   i mean we are not racecar drivers   the only thing was to get enough merging power we would have to turn off the a c   this car diligently moved us from california to louisiana and then to alabama with no problem   our biggest problem with the car    the windshield hummed at any speed over   unfortunately   at    miles   a large promotion   and the thought of another child we decided that it was time for us had come for us to trade our aspire for something larger with more options   it was a very sad moment for us as we had seen a lot and done a lot in that aspire of ours   she had never let us down   we traded her in and said our goodbyes and before we even took delivery of our new car her new owners who bought her right after we traded it in were driving her out   we watched her drive down the road and i must say it was like watching the end of an era for us on a lighter note   we do see our aspire around town every now and then   it always perks my spirits to see her   even better yet   it means she still is running br br  
923,1,  i bought my aspire in   brand new off the lot   i paid    out the door   i had cruise control and a stereo added and later replaced it with a cd player   at first i didn t like the car   the interior was plain   the engine had no get up and go   and i had to put up with the wise cracks about how i was driving a washing machine on wheels   but now   years later i still have the car   my husband drives it now   and with    miles on it the car is still going strong    miles a week commute   i have put   brake jobs on the car   changed the tires all around   times   changed the battery once   had one tune up   and recently replaced a rotor in the engine all in the   years i ve owned the car   not to mentioned the car has slid into two ditches and hit a curb hard which inturn it needed two front end alignments and a new rim   this is all the repair i have put into the vehicle and it is still going strong   i predict this car could go     with proper maintenance and i only paid    dollars for it   what a deal   as i now see it anyone who wants an affordable   reliable   and fun car should get this one   but if you are looking for performance and style steer clear   this is not the car for you fyi   the aspire is actually a kia avella   the car model was purchased and marketed in the states by before kia made its move in the american market   the car was    kia and      if you are looking for a car similar to the aspire in todays market check out the kia sephia the body style and features are different but under the hood is pretty much the same     
924,1,  my wife was looking for an suv a couple of years ago and i talked her into a mini van   we picked out a   windstar because it had everything we wanted   v engine to pull a camper   seats seven   extra cargo space and a reasonable price used   our van had    miles when we purchased it   we now have    miles and had a number of minor and major problems   luckily we purchased an extended warranty and have not had to fork out too much cash the computer had to be replaced at about    miles   covered under extended warranty the head gasket had to be replaced at about    miles   covered by due to a faulty gasket problem the front tie rod had to be replaced at    miles   covered under extended warranty the engine had to be replaced at    miles   covered by for the same problem as the head gasket   a note to all windstar owners   will replace your engine up to    miles or reimburse you if you already had your head gasket replaced or your engine replaced after comparing problems with a friend of mine   i was alerted to a transmission problem and a break problem with the   windstars   i have not had any problems with the brakes or transmission   but if i do   i hope they come before my extended warranty expires got it back from shop with the new engine and now the transmission fluid is leaking   i finally got it back to the dealer and he said it was the seal at the torque converter   another    on my extended warranty other then these mechanical problems   we do like our windstar   it s roomy   comfortable   easy to drive   we pull a pop up trailer with it   but you can not find air shocks for the windstar   so all you can really get is heavy duty shocks to pull a trailer   the v   l does fine pulling the trailer   but eats a lot of gas   the windstar has the cargo capacity of an extended caravan   this helps on grocery day or for trips i would not recommend an older model windstar   but i would hope the newer models have all the bugs worked out   for all you older model owners   cross your fingers and save your pennies   repairs could be in your future david since writing this opinion i had a sensor for the egr valve go bad which cost    to fix and it was covered on my extended warranty so far i have had    worth of work done using my extended warranty   the    i paid for the warranty was money well spent   that doesn t even include the head gasket and engine rebuild that paid to fix br br  
925,1,  we own a   windstar   with the rising prices of mini vans a used one is a good option for many people and   windstars are easy to find and reasonably priced for a family we bought our s in nov   and it had    miles on it   we bought it because of it s safety rating   safest mini van made   and it s roominess in the last     years i have learned a lot about this vehicle   i ve driven it in snow   wind   rain   long trips etc good points   roomy one of the largest mini vans made   plenty of leg room in the first and second row   an adult can stand   bent over   next to the seats and maneuver children and items fairly easily fast   the windstar has great pick up   which is vital when getting on busy highways   it has a   l engine which makes all the difference in the world mileage   as minivans go   it isn t bad   i can get about    miles on one tank    gallons visibility   you can see everything around you very well   no terrible blindspots   at least for me handling   drives like a car   not a large van bad points buggy transmission   the transmission is sensitive   if you don t have it lined up just right you will not really be in park   drive   reverse etc   you must always use your emergency brake on the slightest incline heavy second and third seats   the second and third seats are removable but not on wheels   the second seat can be removed by one person without much trouble but the third seat really takes two   it is not impossible   just a pain overall   i really like the vehicle and would buy another and recommend it   the pros outweigh the cons   i happily put up with the heavier seats and lack of drivers side sliding door for the extra room br br  
926,1,  my   windstar at    miles has settled into a comfortable middle age   but it went through a lot of grief to get this far   an automatic transmission rebuild and head gasket replacement are the two major repair items so far   anyone looking to buy a used   check to see if the head gasket on the    liter engine has been replaced   if not   keep on looking the windstar is a quiet   comfortable vehicle with a good view of the road   the long wheelbase helps provide an absorbent ride   the windstar is adequately powered at best   gas mileage on our van has averaged    mpg   the cabin is comfortable up front   a bit claustrophobic in the rear   didn t get the rear captain s chairs   but after riding a few hours in back recently   i wish we had   the rear seats are difficult to remove for hauling   but once they re out   you have a huge space for cargo   the rear seatbacks fold flat in an instant   an option i use a lot to haul my bike in the back   the windstar meets our needs as a family of five very well   now that it s paid for   we plan to run it into the ground br br  
927,1,  we bought a   windstar about   months after they came out in april of    we had owned two aerostars previously   i loved driving it   we made alot trips in it and it never left me on the side of road   we had our first problem with the sliding door   the sensors would go off and the chimes would start   took it back several times but could not find a problem with it   they even tried adjusting the door we finally figured out the problem   if you get the contacts wet or they are dirty even just a little then that will set the chimes off and turn the interior lights on   we didn t have any more problems until a trip to phoenix and the check engine light came on   took it in and is was an oxogen sensor   had to have the brakes done at   miles it took four times to get it right   i blame that on the dealer   we had finally payed it off this past september and thought we would be without a car payment for a couple of years   wrong in december with    miles on it the transmission was acting up   it would not shift into first gear after stopping   xmas was not the time to give me problems with an upcoming trip home for the holidays   we decided to trade it in and buy a bigger vehicle   for the most part it was a good van it served its purpose while we had it   it was getting small for since we have teenage boys and they are all over   feet tall   i liked the ride better than the caravan   the seats were alot more comfy   i would recommend this van to families   overall it really never let us down until the end br br  
928,1,  i have a   windstar and i think it is the best around   i have three kids   ages     and newborn   it is so easy to get them in and out through the side door   i never have to worry about leaving my oldest on one side of the car unattended   plus   the van is roomy enough that i can strap them all in easily   then i just turn around and hop in the driver s seat   there is plenty of legroom   the most i have seen in a minivan   even being very pregnant   i can drive the windstar comfortably   there is lots of cargo space   we have a large wagon and we just plop in in the back for day trips   also we are campers and there is plenty of space for our tent   action packers and cots   even all the extras we need for baby like a pack and play   i highly reccommend the windstar   it is the best purchase we could have made      br br  
929,1,  if you have kids and need a vehicle a   year owner and i don t like fords   but i do like this one   i own a   windstar and love it   i have had it long enough to know whether i d buy another or not   what really matters when owning a van in addition to reliability   how the vehicle holds up to a family   we are a young family of   and our   youngest     amp     have grown up with this being our only vehicle we have never had any major problems with the van and people still are amazed to find out that the van is nearly   years old and still looks new   what i am getting at is that we have not done anything above normal maintenance and cleaning   maybe even a little less than the average person   and the van still looks good inside and out   the fabric does not show wear or stains   the carpet has maintained its look as well   the gas mileage     ltr engine   is a little less than i would like   about   highway and   city   the only things we ve had to replace or fix in five years is a power window and one a c relay switch   
930,1,  i have owned a lot of different vehicles over the years for various purposes including four different pickups   my most recent purchase was the power stroke diesel   model year    it is a f   xlt model supercab with and automatic and   wheel drive   i have owned it for a year and the following sums up my experience with the vehicle mechanical attributes   rating   out of    the power stroke has proven to be a real reliable engine with lots of low end torque while at the same time providing a fair amount of top end cruising ability   i pull a   foot fifth wheel trailer and have been able to climb a   to    grade and still maintain   miles per hour with the trailer attached   the fuel mileage is good for a working rig with a big mill   mpg w o the trailer on    w   the trailer   the trucks digs right in from a dead stop and accelerates well   even with the trailer on there two things to be wary of when considering this vehicle   one is that the transmission   i have the three speed automatic with overdrive   is weak   it can not stand to be overheated much at all and so it needs to have an auxiliary transmission cooler for any significant pulling   the mechanics i go to have recommended to me that it should have at least a   quot   loop quot   cooler   these same mechanics have also recommended to me that the transmission be regularly serviced at least as often as the manual recommends   and more often for any significant pulling the other thing to remember to consider is that being a diesel   regular oil changes are a must   changing the oil and filters are spendy considering it has a two quart filter and a fifteen quart oil capacity   however this is a minor cost considering that with regular maintenance   some of the diesel trucks have gone    miles with out a major repair body and comfort amenities   rating   out of    the engineers did a good job of putting together a nice cab   seats   etc   on this particular model   amp   year   the driver s seat with lumbar and   way motorized adjustment gives me an ability to move the seat into almost any position i want   my brother has the same model   amp   year pickup and hates the feel he gets out of his seat   he says he always ends up with a back ache out of it   so i have run into mixed opinions on this feature the gauges are in full view and well lit   the temp   gauge often sticks in the normal operating position during an overnight cool down   my brother s does the same thing   the stereo works well with front and rear factory speakers and provides a good balanced sound   my only complaint here is that the clock literally gains a minute each day   which i don t think should happen with a fully electronic unit   the air conditioner works very well as does the heater   both are musts in my book the front passenger s seat tilts forward and rolls full forward all with one release lever   which allows extremely easy access to the rear seat   speaking of the rear seat   i have found it very stiff and uncomfortable   although my kids and other passengers have not complained   i used to have a    gmc    ton sierra extended cab   and i found the rear seat in it to be much more comfortable   however suspension and ride   rating   out of    this is a truck and it rides as such and so i don t expect anything different out of it   for the most part you do feel the bumps in the road but it is smooth and comfortable and so not unpleasant of a ride   the truck also exhibits a wide turning radius which again you get used to   but it would be nice to be able to turn in a narrower radius in parking lots and on back country roads overall   rating   out of    i really enjoy the truck   it pulls nice and i feel that i could do almost anything i wanted to do with it   it has the power that i need   yet provides the comfort   space   and other amenities that i desire in a vehicle   especially for long trips with the rv attached     
931,1,  i purchased my   explorer   eddie bauer edition new   it was a dealer demo   in   after shopping and comparing nearly every competing suv the explorer was the most comfortable of all comparable suv s at that time   and five years later has lost very little of its comfort for driver or passengers   the notable comfort deterioration that has occurred is in various electrical system failures   neither the dealer nor has taken an acceptable level of responsibility for repairing electrical defects   although the sound system has been repaired   times at no cost   other failures such as heat ac fan speed adjustability and wiper timing adjustability were not warranted the explorer has provided    reliable transportation   having never required any functional service other than for normal maintenance   it handles like a smaller car in many ways   including cornering   it does burn a lot of gas   averaging about   miles per gallon with a mix of city and highway driving the explorer is not designed for hauling large loads   but can fit a surprising amount of bulk if necessary   it is well suited for family trips overall this was an expensive car to purchase   is expensive to fuel   and at a nuisance level has been expensive to keep functioning electrically   it has served its purpose quite well for me   my primary consideration was comfort for driver and all passengers   with transportation reliability being a high priority as well br br  
932,1,  hi i was out in the market and i came accros with the idea of purchasing a suv   i found none that would fit my pocket   so i had to go to an auction to get me one   this baby came along   eddie bauer   loaded   x   control track   man   my first suv and i had a winner   here s my opinion b i exterior    on the outside this truck is a winner   its tall   heavy and has a sporty look   the side moldings and trim add a lot of personality to it   big all aroung glass allows you to see all over the place   keyless entry and alarma integrated   roof rack and a hitch ball come to make everything more appealing   wheels and tires      and beautiful     spoke chome wheels b i engine    it has the    cid engine   mine was   cylinder but there s a   cylinder model too   the millage on this baby was kinda high   k miles but if you could only hear her   its like the day it rolled off the assy ine   the previous owner did a terrific job taking care of it b i interior    leather baby   all leather all over   front and rear seats   central and side arm rests   the instrument cluster seems somewhat not so luxury but it gets the job done   to small glove box for my taste tho   seats are the bomb   confortable   soft and lumbar support   this is for both front seats   on the back   there s space for that trip or the groceries   a convenient jack storage space and   frame bolted hooks so you can strap that baby seat or a flat tire b i extras     cd changer and premium sound kicks it   subwoofer integrated   automatic antenna   rear wiper and squirter   premium carpet job   rear seat radio and ac controls   automatic climate control   power windows and locks   cargo cover   off ebay    x   baby   all the way b i inconveniences   so far    ac unit on all explorers had a failure called blend door actuator   mine has it   it wo nt let you mix the temp for the air   its either all cold or all hot change the shocks for a model that allows you a softer ride   otherwise you will get yourself a   kidney milkshake only motorcraft plugs are recommended for engines i hope this review has helped you and please rate it  
933,1,  purchased a new   e   conversion van   one of the best vehicles we ve ever owned   the captains   chairs are very comfortable and can be adjusted to just about any position one could want   the rear bench folds down into a bed that s both comfortable and easy to operate   we had a rear a c installed    not a separate compressor but a separate coil and blower   works extremely well    best    we ve ever spent   opted for the   cylinder    like the mileage we get   up to   hwy miles   and it holds highway cruising speed quite well   on other than level roads though   the transmission shifts frequently when the cruise control is on and the speed is over    but on level roads   it works just fine   the separate reading lights allow the kids to read or play games at night without distracting the driver   the noise level is very low   we had the cold weather package added   even though we bought it in el paso   tx   the extra insulation sprayed on the bottom insulates the sound too   have never used the plug in block heater   the van now has about    miles on it   the only repairs have been a new starter     and a front brake job     both were done by a dealer so i m sure better prices could be had elsewhere   oh   and we just replaced the tires   not bad for a vehicle that s driven across the us three times and made innumerable   quot road trips quot   with a family of    all the boys have their own seat   no one touches anyone else   the van is extremely roomy and cost less than any of the minivans we looked at   all in all   a superior value for the money br br  
934,1,  the bronco ii is an awesome vehicle   it can out maneuver any wd out there   except maybe the classic bronco   has good power   it s comfortable   strong axles and manual transmission   spd is the only way to go   rides great   etc   i can t say enough good things about my   bronco ii xlt   i ve had it almost   years and enjoyed every bit of it   this thing is awesome   it s very versatile and rugged and you can do just about anything with it   check out bronco and jamesduff   i get great gas mileage for an older vehicle   it also has a pretty hefty   gallon gas tank   most vehicles this size have no bigger than a   gal tank   the only major problems i ve had are one s i ve caused   i crushed the muffler   wheeling   punctured the gas tank   wheeling   and then the leaf spring sag and minor things to be expected with age   the leaf springs on bronco iis tend to wear out after a while causing rear end sag   but just a little   nothing a leaf spring helper won t fix   i ve also seen   runners with the same problem   leaf springs are relatively inexpensive anyway   probably     for a full set   unless you get lifted springs   the b has outlasted my brother s    jeep and his saab    makes great vehicles   it s got    miles and my bronco s still running strong   it s a pity that they quit making the b in    i wish they still made   em   i love my bronco ii  
935,1,  i just recently bought a escort because of the style of the car   this is a new type of car for my family   i think the car it s self is roomy and smooth riding   this escort is really good on gas   i recently took the car on a short road trip   you don t hear much road noise   any one who is looking for a good dependable car should look into getting one except those with to small kids wish are in car seats   the only problem i had with it so far is that the radio volume will get louder then it wll go real low br br  
936,1,    of my escort experience has been extremely positive   i own a red   escort lx   four door hatchback   to be precise   we only paid    because my dad knew the guy he bought it from   my escort is easily worth      i love my escort   with these gas prices   a car that gets   to   miles per gallon is always good   and you can take them anywhere   interstate   city   dirt roads   etc   i take my escort up over the mountain and down a dirt road a couple times each week when i go to work the gelding i m showing in   h this year   and it does fine   it fights a little going up hill   but any four banger is going to do that   the biggest problem i have with my escort is that it doesn t always start   this doesn t happen as often to me as it does to my cousin   who has   escort lx   but my uncle and grandfather devised a way to start them with a screwdriver   i d have to get all technical about under the hood stuff that i don t know a whole lot about   and all s good there all in all   a great little car   it gets you where you need to go   and this car has so much character   you will not find a car with more character than an escort   i promise you that  
937,1,  my present car passed away one night on the way to work and my wife and i needed a another car van to replace it   i was always interested in the aerostar as our friends have them   with   year old triplets we needed a van to hold all of us   the seven passenger van was just the ticket for us   we purchased a   used in march   and so far no major problems save for having to replace the sliding door track at a cost of     including labour   my wife and i love the fan the   passenger seating is great   it allows us to separate the girls so they won quot t fight on long trips   we highly recommend this van   anyone with a large family would benefit from this van p s   this van has    kilometers on it and it still purrs like a kitten has the pickup of a new van br br  
938,1,  i purchased my new in march of    i purchased it because i needed a truck to use while remodeling a home   but i wanted a vehicle that would be small enough to commute to work   i picked the over the other small trucks out there for a couple of reasons   first and foremost   the was rated at or near the top in most of the ratings categories in consumer reports   second   in its price range   i felt that the offered more in terms of styling and options   the xlt package with sport wheels dress it up nicely   i have been more than pleased with my   it has    miles on it now and i haven t had a single repair   the    liter engine with the five speed manual transmission is sporty and fun to drive   i was originally worried that it would be under powered   but for light hauling and in most driving conditions the engine is more than adequate   the truck rides very well   smoother than small trucks i ve driven in the past   there are   however   some sacrifices made when purchasing a light truck   the room in the cab is tight and unless you have a camper shell   shopping can be a problem   my only regret is that did not invest in the extended cab model   overall   i give my an excellent rating   i would highly recommend a to anyone considering the purchase of a small pick up     
939,1,  i was in the market for a small truck   i looked around and i found that the offered the most for your money   although i later found that the resale on these trucks drop very quikly   for less then i could have bought a toyota standard cab with a   cylinder   i got a super cab with a    v   with a   speed trans and power mirrors   i have put    miles on it with no problems what so ever   the gas milage isn t the greatest   but it s worth it   the    has more than enough power   and tows my    ski boat with little effort   i was really impressed when i hooked up my boat to see how it tows   i drove it from l a to newyork to maine and back to l a with no trouble what so ever   i recently installed a vortech super charger with   pounds of boost and the truck just screams   very very reliable   if anyone has any advice   any problems with     or questions   please e mail me at cornfed aol net   i will gladly answer any questions reguarding the      any advice would be greatly appreciated   
940,1,  my wife and i set out to try every convertible on the market   the range went from the tiny toyota mr with absolutely no storage space    to the chrysler sebring convertible   we were ready to settle for the chrysler when we spotted the thunderbird in a specialty showroom   we took it for a test drive and fell in love immediately   it was well above the price range we were shopping in   k list   but in the end that didn t matter   we bought it two weeks later p the   thunderbird has two options that earlier models did not    horsepower and an auto manual shifter   since the car weighs close to   lbs   the additional horsepower was a welcome addition   it now runs    in a respectable    seconds   keep in mind   this is not designed as a sports car   so acceleration in that range is admirable   the auto manual shifter is selected by pushing the shifter to the right   then selecting up or down a gear manually without using a clutch   we are still getting used to this feature   but i can say that it does improve acceleration p the overall look and feel of the thunderbird can be summed up in one word    style   the retro stylings take you back to the original thunderbird in most every detail   even the rag top has its original roots   rather than take the car to a fully automatic top as was done in the volvo c   another   they left a simple manual latch in the center of the top   with an automatic open close button easy to reach on the dash   when the weather gets nasty   our model came with the optional hard top   this top snaps easily into place   but be sure to have two strong adults to remove it   it weighs a solid   lbs and is fairly awkward   fortunately it also came with a stand for garage storage of the top during the fair weather months p inside the cabin you will find tastefully detailed leather seats   with wood and stainless appointments   heated seats   dual climate control    disc cd changer   dash ignition key   steering wheel mounted radio controls   power mirrors   cup holders and cigarette lighter adapters round out the dash   power seats make driver swaps a breeze p the real fun for this car is a good twisty road   rear wheel drive combined with good weight distribution   and lots of it   make for a very fun drive   brakes are extremely competent    especially given the weight of the vehicle   testing panic stops left me very happy with the car s safety systems   with the top down   the noise level is acceptable   raising the windows brings noise down to soft conversation levels   this includes both wind and engine noise   i can t believe how quiet the engine is while cruising   put your foot in the floor and it will audibly remind you of the v heritage under the hood   speaking of the windows    each time you open the doors   the window automatically drops a quarter inch to release from the rag top   the window automagically creates a tight seal when you close the door again   inserting the key in the ignition prompts the power tilting steering wheel to return to its previous position in front of you   one turn of the key   and you wonder why you didn t just sleep in that comfortable driver s seat   unfortunately the trunk only has space for a couple of small suitcases or a large garment bag   this would not be a good car to take on a two week tour of the country p gas mileage has been fairly consistent   running   city and   highway   we only have   miles on the car so far    the engine won t really be broken in until   miles or so i have to give credit for building a high quality product with little competition   this car is a definite head turner   be it a weekend driver or a daily commuter  
941,1,  i just turned over    miles on my     four door xlt   x   this is my third over the past fourteen years   this is the first that ever had a glitch   the   door ajar   light stays light and occasionally the dome light stays on by itself   the dome light is always on for the first few tire revolutions   i haven t counted the actual number but about twenty feet worth the rear transaxel   clanks   once for each of the first two gears when accelerating from a stop of course the original tires were firestone recall brand   i was lucky enough to have my blow out just before the story hit the media   i paid six hundred plus for a set of big o tires at less than twenty thousand miles   at this time there is no known recourse for people like me who only got hurt in the wallet when their firestone s fell apart for the most part i love my truck   it s got personality and a past    like most of my friends br br  
942,1,  this cobra is the second of this particular breed that i ve owned   the first being a   cobra convertible   my initial reaction when i saw the reveal of this car is wow   the statistics alone are mind boggling   for any car    horsepower   underrated by intentionally   realistic figures are somewhere around   at the rear wheels and    at the flywheel    foot pounds of torque     in    seconds     mile time between    and     all out of the box   finally   an auto maker took the drawing board out of the engineering room in the basement and took it out the enthusiasts that are actually buying and driving the car and said   ok guys   what should we do next   from the beginning   you go in knowing that you re getting a frighteningly fast car   but the deal just keeps getting better   as you sit down inside the car   you noticed the snake badged two tone leather suede seats   the electroluminescent instrument cluster   mach    disc in dash cd player   and the coveted   speed tremec t    speed manual transmission   shared by the cobra s arch nemesis the viper   the front seats are very comfortable for a sports coupe   strongly bolstered   yet still supportive and soft   the driver s seat is power   with adjustments to the height   angle   pitch   side bolster   rear end bolster   lumbar support   etc   the backseat is small   as is to be expected in this breed of car   most cars that can compete from a performance standpoint don t even have a backseat   so my theory is be glad i have one at all   popping the hood of the vehicle reveals a beautifully trimmed   valve dual overhead cam    litre    ci   american v   a small metal plate will grab the eye of anyone looking at an svt engine for the first time   as each engine is hand signed   engraved   by the two man team that built them   mounted proudly atop the large american v is an eaton roots type supercharger   capable of   pounds of boost from the factory   the engine has been modified from its aluminum block cousin that was in the   and   cobra   the new engine block is cast iron   to increase strength for the added stress created by the supercharger   the compression ratio has also been reduced   again   to accommodate the forced induction   after the typical male rush of testosterone   not a sexist comment   have seen plenty of ladies sporting cobras as well as gentlemen   i closed the hood and took a tour around the outside of the car to gauge it s styling   the hood has been modified from the previous hood   both to add room for the blower   and   with the addition of   finally   functional hood vents   to vent hot air from the engine compartment   the front fascia has been modified   with more open areas to allow cool air to pass into the engine compartment to facilitate better engine cooling and venting of the massive front disc brakes   along side the vehicle   has changed the rocker panel trim slightly   and the side scoops   unfortunately not functional   have been modified from the    run   the rear of the    is very different   with a much cleaner look than its predecessors   and it s own siblings in the corral   the spoiler is now more integrated into the body   reminiscent of the spoilers on the bmw m series cars   the tunnel like large tail pipes make themselves very visible   as does the badging naming this the head of the svt pack   minor tweaks such as spoilers on the windshield wipers   making them functional up to a frightening   miles per hour   body color keyed break away mirrors   and the restyled fascia set this snake apart from the others in the svt cobra den   now that i had investigated all that i could about the car with it motionless   it was time to wake the beast up for a little stretching of the legs   immediately upon ignition   the car makes its intentions known with that typical american v burble   turning every head within   feet   after playing with the shifter   i decided it was time to set out on this little adventure   as i pulled out into the highway   i noticed how mild mannered this   supercar   seemed to be as i drove it into afternoon traffic   this car could very easily be slated into a comparison with clark kent    superman   with a light foot on the throttle   its not jerky or hard to control in the least   it was when i decided to put my foot into the floorboard that the car underwent a metamorphosis   the   boost   needle went full tilt to   psi   the tachometer started its screaming climb to   rpms   and i was firmly planted   goofy grin and all   to the back of my seat   wow   as i shifted into second at about   rpms   the whole cataclysmic process repeated itself   approaching   rpms this time   i noticed oh my god   i am in second gear   going   miles an hour   in just a bit shy of   seconds   deciding that i wanted to keep my privilege to drive    i was in a   zone   i backed off the accelerator and shifted into third   giving my internal organs a moment to catch up to my body   i got on the interstate and repeated the jet like acceleration   up to about mph and back down   ok   now i don t just think the car is fast   i know it is   lateral acceleration   however   is just one part of the equation that makes a great sports car   what goes up must come down   once i made sure i was in the clear with cars around me   a firm stomp on the brakes brought the massive   inch front brembo rotors to life and as expected   in true cobra fashion   the car stopped on a dime and handed over   and    cents change   ok   that s two parts of the equation passed with flying colors   it can accelerate like a tomahawk missile and stop like it had reverse thrusters but can it handle anything less inviting than interstate    i took the car to the road that my house is off of   in rural paulding county   georgia   the road is a blast for a driving enthusiast   two   degree curves   and soft slopes that turn halfway down a hill   etc   i made one run at a normal pace just to get a feel for the car   the second run etched an image of the car driving around on tires lined with double sticky tape   this car is glued to the road   pushing it near its limits will illicit a bit of a happy rear end in hard cornering   which is to be expected and is welcomed as long as the driver is as capable about handling it as the car is doing it   the handling is brilliant   with many welcome tweaks to the suspension in    the body roll is very minimal   as the body feels more rigid than did my    on the open highway   the ride is as nice as to be expected in a car with the handling capabilities of this vehicle   if you want a smooth ride   opt for the same base engine in the mercury marauder   this is   after all   a supercar   wet traction is also above average   with help of the car s goodyear eagle f tires and the standard traction control   i do at times find it easier just to reach down into the endless pool of torque and start out lazily in second gear in heavy rain to eliminate any rear wheel slippage   the abs system on the car is very advanced   and even in panic braking in wet conditions   the car comes to a very confident stop   i have yet to experience it in snowy weather   but i am hoping that this car will have to experience very little of it with me residing in georgia   the steering is firm and responsive   as is the clutch shifting engagement   though the shifter can be a bit quirky at times   the clutch does take some getting used to   as one person that i let drive the car put it   you ll have the legs of a linebacker after driving this thing every day   all in all   one couldn t ask for a better balance of ride quality and handling ability in a better package   that basically sums up each of the individual parts that are required to make up a good sports car   tallying all of the scores   the cobra is simple an achievement on the part of the special vehicles team   the cobra unfortunately lost its competition from gm this year   with their f body cars no longer being produced after    authors note   the   cobra is faster than any f body gm offered in    snicker   the price on this car at its release was      though many dealers across the country are price gouging it   anywhere from   dollars over sticker to    in areas where the car is hard to get   i absolutely refused to pay a dime over sticker   and finally found an honest dealership here in atlanta that was selling the car for the same sticker it got onto their lot with   the price tag on this car is a true steal   considering the next rival to this car is the corvette z   the two vehicles are truly not in the same class   but as the   cobra is faster and more powerful than the stock c corvette   the z is its most loved comparison in the gm war that s been raging since the   s   the base price tag on the z is in the neighborhood of      for comparison s sake   a   dollar investment into modifications will put the cobra to a performance level of    rear wheel horsepower   not that this author would every encourage the modification of such a beautiful automobile   calling the   svt cobra anything less than a supercar would be underselling it dramatically   the   holds the title of being the most powerful    more advertised horsepower than the   cobra r   to roll out of the plant   and it carries the honor with flying colors   the platform is going to be retired for the   model year in favor of a modified version of the jaguar x type and lincoln ls platform   code named dew lite   one can only wait in stitches to see what kind of work of art the guys at s special vehicles team will produce on that platform  
943,1,  i am sixteen years old and i have recently purchased a probe   i have owned this vehicle for about six months and i love it   i don t really have the cash to be buying new parts and having to fix things so this car is ideal for me   i haven t made one stop at the shop yet   i like the way that all your controls are right there   especially the turn signal   which you can easily turn on with a flick of the pinky   the back seat may be my only complaint   but being in my young years still it doesn t really come into play   the probe is quick    sporty   fairly cheap and very fun to drive     
944,1,  i bought my    door hatchback aspire used from my neighbor   it had    miles on it and i paid     for it   i just love this little car   my boyfriend is tall and was very surprised about how much leg room he has in it   i get excellent gas mileage    mpg   its air conditioner has a hard time while driving in town and sitting in traffic   but works fine when on the open road   it will go fast speeds     if you are in a hurry   but does tend to start vibrating at    excellent for shopping trips   fits well into tight parking places   and has plenty of cargo space   i drive this more than my new   wheel drive   i really enjoy owning this little car  
945,1,  i own a   aspire base model   door hatchback with air   cassette   and the standard transmission   i purchased it recently for a very low price because it had been previously wrecked   this car is however in excellent condition for a   year old mini with    miles i ll be honest   most people would probably hate this as a used car   it has several   quot where the heck is that coming from quot   rattles   buzzes   and clunks   it used to vibrate at higher speeds because the tires were a cheap off brand   michelin weatherhandlers fixed that problem   this particular aspire   having been previously wrecked   probably will not last much longer   but for right now it is doing me just fine as a courier delivery vehicle   there is plenty of room for cargo and the rear seat not only folds down but flips up against the front seats to provide a flat cargo floor   it is fully carpeted   too this car always starts right up and runs smoothly   does not smoke or knock   and has enough power for me   some people might say this car is underpowered   for these folks   do not worry   most    and    liter mazda engines will bolt in with little modification   as will the better geared mazda transmissions   i have been averaging an honest   mpg with this car under hard driving in dallas   texas with the ac running about    of the time   having no power steering is only a chore during parallel parking   which i have to do little of because most of my deliveries go to businesses i have learned that keeping the tires inflated properly will keep the steering light above a crawling speed   the brake rotors are warped now   i am sure turning them will help at least for a little while   the only major problem i foresee with this car is the clutch   it is slipping slightly when i drive harder   but if i take it easy   it shifts and engages fine   the shifter is rubbery   but if you are gentle with it   it will slip right into and out of gear   the rougher you treat it   the tougher it is to get it to shift   i would say this car is not the best for long trips   i have a buick century for those   but to do the basic point a to b to c to d of courier work   this car is okay   i used to own a geo metro and this car is a welcome change   not necessarily better   but it is different br br  
946,1,  in june of    a   f   xl was given to our family as a vehicle   it was grey green two tone   with grey cloth interior and automatic transmission inside the truck is a well designed and easy to use dash   most knobs and dials are easy to find   and fit well in your hands   most materials of are very high quality   however   the radio controls are awful   the buttons are too close together   and you have to take your eyes off the road just to turn it on   however   the radio and cassette player put out amazing sound quality   the speakers work well   and surround the whole truck cab with your choice of music   the bench seat does not give enough back support   you get a   quot sinking quot   feeling when you sit down   the air conditioner keeps you ice cold in the hottest weather   and in the dead of winter   the cab is red hot in only a matter of minutes   outside   the whole truck looks great   the paint is average   but there are swirl marks all over after washing   and the alloy wheels   where equipped   corrode quickly   so one must keep them clean   the chrome wheels and bumpers   along with the two tone paint   really accent the exterior   the box is huge and can handle most loads   but the tailgate is too high and rather heavy   loading the box requires   people the ride is bone jarring   you feel almost every vibration the road can throw at you   there is little wind and road noise   though   the v engine provides ample power and torque   but you get the feeling you re driving a family sedan instead of a pickup   the   speed automatic   with overdrive   transmission robs the engine of much needed power and shifts roughly   however   it handles curves responsively and with confidence   and parking is not a problem   you could steer this truck with your index finger   surprisingly   this truck is a blast to drive   you can throw the f   any curve   and it inspires confidence every time reliability is not a problem   the only problems i ve had with it so far is a broken driver s door lock   a cassette stuck in the cassette player   and a minor transmission repair   if you are looking for a truck to do basic hauling   moving   or just to run back and forth to the store   then the f   is the truck for you   it s tough   reliable   and fun to drive   it s a combination truck family sedan   and it s one great buy     
947,1,  bought truck brand new september    xl shortbed    engine   speed with    rear end   has    miles   i bought this truck for use in my landscape buisness   it has never been driven without a trailer in tow   usually about    lbs   still has original clutch    amazing   has only gone through one set of front brake pads   i had a problem with a leaky smog tube which was misdiagnosed and ended up costing over     and have replaced both fuel pumps and had the fuel system cleaned out at a cost of     however this may have been caused by running the tanks low to avoid gas stops   i live in the arizona desert and the truck is parked outside so i am very impressed that the finish still looks like new   as does the interior   this vehicle is very sun resistant   the engine runs flawlessly in stop and go driving with heavy loads in the arizona heat of    degrees   and is pleasant to drive   i must say i am very pleased with this vehicle   it has made me a ton of money and still looks and runs like new  
948,1,   why focus b of the choices available to us through our leasing program   the focus was simply the cheapest model with the required safety features   twin airbags   anti lock braking system   we have been driving a leased   focus auto sedan for about   months now in australia b driving experience   we have certainly enjoyed the improvement in our driving experience as compared with our previous   year old small car   daewoo cielo   much quieter   smoother   more powerful   we found ourselves more relaxed after longer drives   from that perspective we are very happy with this car b features and options   some of the features are annoying   particularly that the indicator controls are on the   wrong   side of the steering wheel   also   the indicator noise is incredibly loud    its unbelievable that the designers included such an annoying noise in their design   the stereo controls on the steering wheel are so close to the actual stereo controls its of no benefit to have a second set   in fact the track radio station control on the steering wheel is not intuitive and i have to work it out every time i use it   i ve stopped using it now   a common problem with the focus is that the fuel gauge fails during the first two months    this happened on our car and on several others that we know of   a further issue is that the cigarette lighter does not seem compatible with our phone charger    the same charger works in a number of other cars that we have used   finally   the air intake defaults to   open   every time that the car starts   so closing it in traffic becomes a regular chore for us   so much for the negatives the features that we like are this car s comfort   handling and performance   its got high headroom which is a big plus   the door lock and boot lock remote is something we love   plenty of space in the boot the options that we got were   roof rack   we removed this immediately    the noise on the highway was shocking   scuff plates   yes we like them   passenger seat bag   too big   gets in the way   boot liner   excellent for cleaning up spills   and boot carrier net   saves the shopping from rolling around  
949,1,   note   i have not driven the   cobra r   many people have criticized me and given me nr ratings for lack of personal experience   i have ridden in this car   and since there are only   of these cars in production   i feel my personal experience will suffice   i have a vast knowledge of this vehicle due to research   this and my love for this car is why i am writing this epinion   if you feel i deserve an nr for not driving this car   then that i will accept it   thanks   hope you enjoy the review b to say the least   the year   was an interesting year for s special vehicle team   svt   with delays on the production of the   cobra because power outputs were lower than listed   svt produced a limited edition of the   cobra which was given the glamorous name   cobra r the most powerful automobile ever produced   the cobra r brings awesome power and mean looks to the road   because of limited production of the vehicle   only   were made   the prices have boomed past      some people think it is crazy to pay such outrageous money for a while others are willing to pay the premium to own such a majestic vehicle b performance   the cobra r packs a    dohc v engine   this huge piece of equipment forced the redesign of the hood of the car just to fit this bad boy in the front of the car   the large bulge in the hood gives evidence to the size of this mammoth power house   intake and exhaust ports were redesigned by svt to improve the air flow for the car   despite the rather heavy weight of this car   the   horses under the hood make this car zoom    in about    seconds and    in about    seconds   due to the powerful engine and amazing aerodynamics of the cobra r   the top speed exceeds   mph   exhaust on the cobra r is also been modified greatly   because of rear suspension and fuel tank complications   rear exiting exhaust pipes had to be voided   the car has side exiting exhaust tips directly in front of the rear wheels   this automobile also comes with a new   speed manual transmission as opposed to the standard   speed which comes with most cobra vehicles b suspension   the suspension in the cobra r is rock solid   this is good and also bad   for track use   which is basically what the cobra r is intended for   the cobra r handles exceptionally   however   for road use   the rock solid suspension creates a rough ride   the cobra r has a lowered ride height and   inch wheels wrapped in   zr tires    exterior   the cobra r s most noticeable features on the exterior are definitely the front racing air dam and the rear spoiler   both body pieces give the automobile a definitive look as well as the look of a mean racing machine   the   cobra r s produced are all the trademark color of red   when i first saw one of these cars at a fairly large dealership where i live   i was in awe   there is a majestic aura about this car that is difficult to explain   maybe it s the fact that only   of these vehicles exist or maybe it s the combination of beauty and power   being a huge fan   i believe this car is stunningly beautiful   i actually got my friend who works at the dealership to take a couple pictures of me and the cobra r b personal experience with the cobra r   i have a friend who works at the svt licensed dealership in my town   i convinced him to let me come in and ride with him in the cobra r   he wouldn t let me drive it   being a huge fan and having read every known article on the cobra r   i took this opportunity without a second thought   when he started up the car   i was amazing at the ear pleasing sound which resonated from the exhaust pipes   i have always thought that s have great sounding engines   but all i can say about the cobra r exhaust tone is   quot wow quot   although we only were in the car for a minute or two   it was amazing   when he hit the gas   i was awestruck with the power of the engine   i literally was pinned to my seat   the ride was slightly rough   but i could care less   the cobra r is truly an all american sports car b other notes about the cobra r   most people who know some information on this vehicle know that this car comes without an air conditioner and a radio   the car is strictly a racing vehicle   not for every day driving   because of the rarity of this car   prices have gone over      the cobra r i rode in went for      svt has created a legendary special edition of a classic car   the cobra r is truly an amazing vehicle that i would love to even be able to see another one in person again   the cobra r is a pure muscle car which is probably owned by people who have money to burn   one thing is for certain   if i had the money   i would definitely do what i could to get my hands on the   svt cobra r br br  
950,1,  we bought our first explorer in    i have to admit i was reluctant about driving a   quot truck quot   but was soon won over   it was almost as luxurious as any car i d owned and   boy   could i see better on the road   i really enjoyed it and it was very reliable after a couple of years we traded it for a   eddie bauer version   even more bells and whistles and again very reliable   at this point i knew i would never go back to a   quot car quot   again recently   we bought the   limited edition   i absolutely love it   it has power everything   probably more buttons than i ll ever be able to figure out   but i will have fun trying my favorite new feature are the memory seats   my husband is tall and i was constantly having to re adjust the seat when he would drive my previous explorers   now   we with just a click of the remote opener the seat is perfectly adjusted for me when i get in it has a very smooth ride and handles well   it also has beautiful   very comfortable leather seats   the sound system is great and has the optional   cd player   that is perfect for long trips the explorer is just the right size for me and my husband and is comfortable for our occasional back seat passengers   it also holds lots of suitcases   golf clubs and or dive gear   when needed   it really is the best of both worlds    the comfort of a luxury car   the cargo capabilities of a truck   there s plenty of room in the back to haul groceries or even sustain a massive shopping spree    trust me b update added january    b having driven this explorer for almost    miles and several months i am happy to report   knock on wood   that i have had absolutely no problems with it   i very much love this vehicle    my husband won t let me call it a car   i refuse to call it a truck   and suv is so    well   you know this limited explorer rides very comfortably on the road and it is great for driving around town   it is averaging about   miles to a gallon of gas   i get rave reviews whenever anyone rides with me to lunch   as well   that s always a nice plus we ve hauled a lot of stuff in it   especially right before christmas    we have grandkids   the rear seats fold down for carrying larger items such playhouses   and bicycles in the box i can also tell you we have hauled a new computer with   quot   monitor   big boxes and   foot step ladder at the same time   it was a bit interesting on the drive home   but we got it all in there   one friend laughs that my husband and i have single handedly kept the economy going by our weekend shopping sprees b bonus   bun warmers b i ve also discovered during the unusually cold weather we ve had in memphis   that the seat warmer is an absolutely wonderful option   both the driver and passenger seat comes equipped with this option   it s easy to use   just depress the button on the side of the seat and in a few minutes the leather seats are comfortably warm   we ve had snow and ice a couple of times recently   very unusual for memphis   and these seats have kept me toasty warm b convenient rear controls   the rear heat and air controls have been very convenient for transporting passengers   it allows them to control the blower and keeps them comfortable   you can even let them hookup headphones in the rear   this would be great if i was hauling older kids in the back b some of my favorite options b   memory seats   only available on the limited   this has been such a convenience   no more arguments with my husband   you moved my seat   power seats   driver and passenger   you can move seats forward   backward   up   down   there s also the ability to tilt slightly forward or backward    the memory feature remembers how you like all these options   power windows   standard on limited and eddie bauer versions   windows can be locked and unlocked by the driver   dual controls on steering wheels    it s really nice to be able to adjust the temperature and fan   as well as control the volume of the radio or cd without moving your hands from the steering wheel   power moon roof is nice on warm   sunny days   the console display gives me several options to view my gas consumption   gallons used   miles per gallon   and gas remaining   it also performs various system checks at my request   the cd player has great sound   there is a   disc changer in the console   as well as the ability to play a single disc in the slot in the dashboard   the speakers seem to be everywhere and you can easily adjust their performance to your taste   remote lock security alarm   two clicks on the remote lock assures me that all doors are shut and locked and the alarm is activated   there have been a couple of times a door didn t shut well and i was alerted to by using this feature i love this car and think it would probably be a great buy when it starts showing up in the used car market    if you ever find one   the owners may just hold onto this baby for a while   it s the perfect luxury car that just thinks it s a truck as a happy    time explorer owner i highly the explorer limited   br br  
951,1,  i bought this   explorer xlt as a replacement for my   gmc jimmy   i wanted a new explorer but my jimmy was a piece of junk   see review on it   and i spent a lot of money and i had to buy what i could afford i purchased this explorer at the local gmc dealership with    miles on it   i have put about    miles on it so far and i have had nothing but good service   when i purchased my explorer   it had new general tires on it   i like the feature content such as rear air and radio   compass   cd player   and power equipment   i also like the rear wiper washer   the running boards   and the fog lights   the engine and the transmission are powerful and perform smoothly the gas mileage isn t great but it s an suv and the mileage is just as good as that of my jimmy was   i know some people say explorers aren t stable even with tires other than firestones but my explorer seems very stable  
952,1,  the e is a nice family van to go on long trips   it is also nice to drive around except for the fact that it is about the size of a semi   it gets bad gas mileage because our has a    liter engine but it has very good power for being as big as it is   it is also very comfortable in the front and back and for kids can be very enjoyable since their is tv and vcr plus any game consoles they want   the only thing i had a problem with was when i was getting off the freeway and i took the turn at   mph and the tire ripped off the axle causing it to break the running boards and me to do a   degree turn   if you live somewhere where it snows a lot this is not very good in the snow and i added a lot of weight in the back and it still wasn t  
953,1,  i purchased my probe se    speed   used   in   with    miles   up until a few weeks ago   she was going strong at    miles   i drove her hard   fast   and rough   only had to replace the o sensors   airflow sensor   and tires great ride   fun road tripping car   and handled very well in all kinds of weather only drawback was the price on replacement parts   to replace an o sensor   retail price from the dealership was    each   and both need to be replaced when one goes out    pricy    for a set of sensors   airflow sensor was    retail price from dealership as well   this did not include labor   so unless you want to put them in yourself   these are costly the design lacked in handling tire blowout   i had to retire my baby after she was totaled beginning of this month   i had cooper cobra tires on the car   when the front driver s side tire split   causing the entire front fender   front quarter panel   side panel   undercarriage panel   and door panel to become squashed as if i d run into a pole   requiring complete replacement if i d decided to pursue restoration   also the electric wiring shaft was severed   causing the car to lose power while driving   mph on a curvy interstate   the entire car would ve had to be re wired   the cost for the panels start at    a piece to replace with upper cost of the door panel to      these are after market value prices   the damage was caused due to a poor design in handling tire split   granted   sports cars are not meant to handle these situations beautifully   but having made minor design changes could ve prevented some of these damages overall   i ve never had such a great car run so well with so many miles   i m sure she would ve kept going for another good    miles easy   all parts   excepting for the sensors mentioned above and the tires   were stock and still going strong i d recommend this vehicle for someone who performs regular maintenance on the probe and loves to drive long distances  
954,1,  purchased from city of seattle in an auction for     i ve been the owner of my   periwinkle blue escort lx for a little over a year now   receiving this car when i had first received my drivers license   this car and i have been together through a lot mainly driving the car to school and work   the interior is quite nice and comfortable for myself   although i wish the seats had more adjustment options because they can get to be quite stiff at times and aren t very back friendly for anything more than a daytrip   there isn t a lot of room in this car either   so i wouldn t reccomend it to a family of four or more   however   it s just fine for a short ride driving this car has always been enjoyed   especially on day trips up to the ski resort   in the city this is the perfect car becuase it runs smooth and is easy to drive   freeway driving on this car   however   isn t very fun   the car starts to get a little shaky anywhere after mph   although   is where the car is happiest to sit   and is   very   slow to accelerate   i must give it credit though for maintaining speed smoothly   the only problem i ve ever had with this car is the alternator   and don t go to a dealer to have this one fixed   and the pesky little   check coolant   light that mysteriously flashes on for a while randomly   and randomly shuts off   when the coolant is just fine   got ta love if the car does break down   however   be glad it s light   because this car is really easy to push out of intersections   and very easy to tow with a tractor if need be   i know this from personal experience   and i was pretty glad   my favorite thing about this car is the spacious interior   not for hauling people   but things   the hatchback with the removable cover   and easy fold down backseat make it very easy to stick a lot in there   the feature of being able to fold down one seat alone or the entire back bench has been very nice in many situations as well   i drive up to mt   baker   washington   quite often to snowboard   this car is   perfect   for an intensive hour long drive around fast corners   with three friends for passengers   and one seat folded down for the snowboards   the only shame is sometimes going around the corners you slide a bit when it s not expected   the car s ride can trick you sometimes into thinking the car can do things it really can t cheap cars when it comes to purchasing   parts   and gas   they ride really well and are fun little cars to have   my car may be no audi   but it s mine and i love it   the only thing i ve done to my car was buy it a new stereo   because factory radios aren t worth a thing   so if you would like a cheap car that will last you forever   is pretty dependable   and nice for commuting   this is a decent car for you  
955,1,  this was my very first car    ever   and my husband could not have chosen a better car   we originally chose it because of the price   it was economical and good on gas and we were hoping to have a family at some time during the cars life   so we chose the wagon   nine years   four kids and    miles later   the car is still taking care of us there have been very little problems with this car   the only recurring trouble that we have had to fix year after year is the air conditioning   they told us a few years ago that it was a broken o ring   they tried to give it a recharge of freon   but it still never worked properly   other than the air conditioning   we never had any problems with the car   so considering the price and the mileage we have gotten out of it   i think that the escort wagon was a fantastic deal br br  
956,1,  i have a   escort lx   i m   years old and this is my first car   i totally recommend this vehicle   throughout the time i have had it   i haven t had any major problems   which is suprising considering the age of this car   it s reliable and gets good gas mileage   this is the perfect car for a teenager   for parents   it is a relief to know your child is protected and won t be broken down on the side of the road every other week   it s an automatic and easy to drive and handle   the only problem i have noticed is when the car reaches   miles per hour on the interstate   it becomes a little jumpy and the steering loosens slightly   but   my dad is basically a car expert and he believes this is nothing to worry about buy this car    you will be happy you did br br  
957,1,  i love escorts   i think they re great i owned this european    s model for about   months and had a few problems the main problem in mine was the fuse box   its a really common problem and was why the escort was considered unreliable i know enough about cars to change it myself   but it took a long time and a scrap box cost me       this may not be too much but if you got the dealer to do it for you   it would cost      labour   you would be looking at over      each escort model has a different fuse box   so finding the correct scrap one was hard the other problem with escorts is the locks and alarm system   the barrels wear out very easily although if you know how to dismantle a door panel and remove the lock   the dealer only charges a small amount to change the barrels for you   the alarm is another problem   on other european fords as well   if you lock the door from the passenger side and then unlock the door from the driver side   the alarm will go off   it is caused by a faulty electrical part on either the drivers or passenger side door locks   or both   it can be fixed but the parts will probably break again   check this if you are buying one and use it to knock the price down also check all electrics   check the heater   inside fan   engine fan   and electric windows and anything else you can think of   i would not recommend buying a ghia model or high spec model with a lot of electric parts   as there is to much room for error the main fuse blew on several occasions other than this   i found the car nice to look at   nice do drive   and the handling was good as well   seats were a little uncomfortable on long journeys though   mechanically they are actually very good and the engine problems that occured were purely electricaly related check the exhaust for rust on the back box though as they do not last very long the engine was the same model as the ones used previously in the    model and so are not advanced and can be very noisy if worn   listen to the tappets   if they are very noisy and the car claims to have done    miles   then it is more likely to be    the noises can start from    miles onwards depending on use   people try crafty methods such as using thick oil   or if the oil is not clean   then this will also dampen the noise   find out what oil was used don t be put off by this   if the car is clean with a full history   and is quiet ish   then if the price is right   buy it   all electrical problems can be fixed very cheaply if you do it by yourself   you may never even experience any problems   but be aware of them and carry spare main and regular fuses at all time conclusion popular car and good value for money   cheap spares availiable   never go to the dealers br br  
958,1,  i owned a   escort lx wagon   passed down from parent   while first having gotten my license   this car had a    miles on it when i received it   and sold it to a friend with    miles   it keeps on asking for more punishment   because we were both teenage first time drivers   while i will admit that the interior materials are cheap   the stereo sucks   and there were no power windows or locks   i think that it was bought new for about    dollars   so what s to be expected   the engine was fairly punchy for being only hp   the car is light enough for it   the steering is a little sloppy   but not bad   i felt very secure in this car   and always trusted the reliability   it had rust under the back wheel wells   but i fixed it myself   the paint had begun to faid as well   it hadn t really been cared for before i got it   either way i think that it is a safe bet   and a good   easy car for first time drivers to learn on   i drive a   avenger now   and probably would hate to go back to the less refined escort     read my gushing review of my avenger   love that car    but i probably would get one real cheap if the avenger was in an accident   but that escort is an amazing car br br  
959,1,  the excursion limited   an oversize status statement   looking at the excursion   there is no doubt that it is a formidable machine   this oversize suv is really beautiful whether you look at its exterior or its interior   two words can describe the interior of the excursion limited   roomy and luxury   sitting behind the steering wheel of the excursion you have the impression that you could park a second car inside   the limited edition comes equipped with leather seats   a   way captain style seat for the driver   and rich looking wood grain trims on the interior door panels and also on the front console   these features really give the excursion s interior a fantastic appearance   as for the front cabin the rear of the excursion will again offers lots of room   the second row of seats can either be completely folded or folded in a    manner   the third row seats can also be folded and you will also have the option to remove it from the truck if you need to transport cargo   for the driver with the exception of the glove compartment   which is to far on the passenger   side   all other gauges and controls are easy to see and reach   the sound system   an am fm   cassette   single cd stereo is superb and it is only surpassed by the quality of the sound it emits   the exterior body of the excursion limited is as attractive as the interior   the color of the excursion i test drove was deep blue with beige body side moldings and this made for a super color combination with the tan leather interior   i really liked the tri panel rear door   it sure makes it easy to load cargo and equipment in the excursion   the top part will open upward as for most other suv but the lower portion of the rear will split open in the middle   the excursion also comes equipped with a class iv load equalizing trailer hitch that will allow to safely pull a load of up to    pounds   driving the excursion on the highway is a great experience   but aside from driving it on the open road i do not believe it makes for great driving within city limit and for off roading   it is a very comfortable truck to drive and it is dead quiet   to me it is like a lincoln on a truck frame   a friend of mine who owns a marina uses his excursion to pull boats around   he told me that his old suburban would do a much better job at pulling a loaded trailer than his new excursion   the   excursion limited i drove was equipped with a v   powerful engine   the transmission is a   speed automatic transmission   with a shift on the fly x system   the towing capacity is    pounds and the cargo space   with all seats folded and third row removed is   cubic feet   as you probably noticed after reading this review is that i really do have mixed feeling about the   excursion limited   it is a very beautiful truck   actually i think that it is too nice to be used as a working vehicle   but then it is also much too big to be used for city commuting   i guess this leave that it is an expensive suv   toy   for those who have it all  
960,1,   purely physical   originally i fell in love with the looks of the truck   the side steps   the sliding rear window   the emerald green paint job   the plush front seats   the little cupholders   and of course the awesome stereo system   the has been a decent vehicle mechanically until this last year but i will get into that later   besides the physical appeal   the truck is incredibly   economical   to drive   that is important especially with these gas prices   the only car that gave me better fuel economy was an old vw bug   the bed of the truck is capable of hauling small lightweight loads   i like it because not that many people ask me to help them move since the capacity of the bed is limited if you are looking for a truck with a lot of power this is not the one   the   cylinder engine would not be my choice next time around   i hate when those big trucks pass me by on the onramps the provides a smooth comfortable ride under normal weather conditions   however   i have had several problems with slipping in the rain and snow even on the lightest of days   i weighted the truck down last winter with   lbs   of sand and still had trouble on snowy days    bad news   in the last year i have had to have the switches in both doors replaced that control the overhead lighting system   it really is annoying to be driving down the highway with inside lights that won t go off   this was a freebie because the dealership said there was a recall i also had to have the accuator switch on the ignition replaced just recently   one day i just hopped in the truck and all my panel lights were on as well as the radio but there was no key in the ignition   when i went to turn the key   nothing   that little trip to the dealership was      of course my warranty ran out about   months ago   now the check engine light has decided to come on and continues to shine brightly even though i have had everything checked out   who knows why b overall rating   overall i would say that this really has been a good truck but i do plan on going with a larger version next time with more power   the is priced right with a lot of features for the buck but whether you like the truck or not is going to depend on your ability to deal with the downfalls  
961,1,  i m    quot   and own a    xl regular cab pickup   i give the truck a rating of   stars because it is perfect for someone who wants what my particular truck has to offer   that being said i would buy a truck with different options features and configuration if i had it to do over again   keep the following things in mind when you go to buy a   or any other small pick up b color   my truck is gorgeous black with metallic gray trim and a gray interior   i will never buy another black truck again   ok i say that now   and when i see another black beauty in the showroom i ll probably buy one again   the problem is that there isn t a hotter looking color for a truck than black   it looks tough   it looks sophisticated   it looks like marty mcfly s   toyota pickup that he dreams will be in his garage when he comes back to the future   heaven forbid that you use your truck like a truck though   any little scratch shows   i had a heart attack the first day i took my truck to the car wash only to see it come out with swirls where the dryer s terry cloth towel had been   you can imagine my dismay every time i haul mulch around   or put bags of cement in the bed   when clear coat gets scratched on a black paint job it shows up white   black also looks terrible when it gets salt on it from a the northeastern roads   i would say your best bet for truck colors is    silver     tan     white     red b cab size   regular cab trucks have no benefit in riding convenience over a mazda miata   as a matter of fact   you might be able to get more stuff out of the weather in a miata   than in my regular cab   i bought a truck box just to solve the problem of no interior space   at least the box gives me a place to put   or   bags of groceries   really though   if you plan on hauling kids   or even going on long trips   either buy an extended cab   or buy another vehicle   a regular cab is only useful for around the town hauling   and possibly longer trips with only   people   don t even think that you can fit a rd person in the middle seat especially with a stick shift b bed style   i ve got a fleet side   long bed   and i love it   fleet side trucks are the only ones that will fit x sheets of anything   the only advantage i can see to a step side is that it may have more stylish lines   even that is debatable   oh yeah   and it might be easier to climb up into the bed   if you tend to need to get in there often b x or x   if you live in any location that has snow please do not buy a x pickup truck   i can t tell you how many people in the northeast i see with their x s loaded to the hilt with sandbags only to still have no traction   i load up my x with sandbags just so that i don t have to have the   wheel on as much   the extra ground clearance of a x   while making the truck a little top heavy   is a great when you want to clear the   foot snowdrift that the plow left for you at the end of your driveway   my truck has locking hubs and a shifter on the floor to engage the four wheel drive   this is a really nice system as i only lock the hubs between november and april   snow season   the truck gets better gas mileage when the hubs are unlocked   when i need the four wheel i just shift the extra shifter   and it s on    even at full highway speed   now the alternative is the push button four wheel drive which is the equivalent of having the hubs locked at all times   this means a little worse gas mileage   but a little easier operation   only having to push a single button whenever you want   wheel b so   what s so great about your b well   the stick shift v is smooth as silk   there s plenty of power there for all road conditions   i can t vouch for the towing power until i get a nice toy to test it with   i have a rubberized floor which means a whisk broom and a hose cleans out the interior quickly   the seats are the most comfortable of any of the trucks i tested     chevy   toyota   while the regular cab is small   i have no problem taking the truck on long trips   the aluminum alloy wheel are stylin   and non corrosive so they should stay shiny forever   the price was right    with new college grad discounts and rebate i only paid     for a brand new x set of wheels b what sucks about your b the thing didn t come with a cup holder   now   this is not indicative of all because i ve seen other with cup holders   i guess it was just my combination of stick shift with   wheel drive shifter on the floor that made the designers think that they couldn t fit a cup holder   i managed to install one of my own no problem   the regular cab    my next truck will have an extended cab   or be one of those sup s   sport utility merged with a pickup   so that i ve got ample interior space   and still have a bed for hauling dirty stuff   the black paint    for the reasons mentioned above all i can say is know what you re getting into before buying a small truck   they re not for everybody   if they re for you   i would definitely recommend buying a truck in the series     
962,1,  i recently purchased a   xlt   it is the     cylinder engine with a   speed automatic   it is the single cab shortbed version   it s caymen green with a prarie tan cloth interior   first off   this truck was a screaming deal   it was very low mileage and the price was very nice and the dealership   hemborg of norco   ca   is a very reputible and good dealership   this truck feels solidly built   the ergonomics are some of the best for a compact   the standard engine is peppy enough to not aggravate you and the interior feels very nice   the stereo is the am fm cassette player and it sounds great for being stock   the a c will either freeze you or toast you if you overdo it   so needless to say   it works good   the ride is bouncy   but it s a truck so that s normal   but it does handle good   though   this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship   as of mar       my truck is still running strong   no squeeks or rattles of any kind   no mechanical problems   save for a burnt out lightbulb that was easily replaced and a flat tire due to broken glass   the twin i beam suspension is very competent off road as i found out in the cajon pass is so cal   for a   banger with an auto tran   it hauls off road with only a touch of oversteer that is easily controled   i was expecting poor braking performance due to the rear drums   but i was pleasantly suprised about how good it stops   the only things that i don t like about it is that it has no tachometer and the speedlimit governer stops the party at   mph when a lesser toyota tacoma tops at   mph   otherwise i m quite happy with it and when i get out of college and get a better paying job   i ll get a brand new    xlt or edge    with the    liter v    speed automatic transmission    wheel drive   cd player   power equipment group   off road alloy wheels and the   door supercab  
963,1,  i bought my   not knowing a whole lot about trucks in general   and was pleasantly surprised with the test drive   it handles and accelerates fine   and is very handy when moving furniture and crates from place to place though i m guilty of not getting regular oil changes   i haven t had any mechanical problems   all of the instruments are easy to reach and operate   and the air conditioner will freeze most anyone   the cold missouri winters aren t a problem either   the cab is usually too hot over a long period of time   be forewarned   please purchase the   wheel drive option   if you live anywhere where the roads tend to ice up   kansas city   you will need it   i have to pile a minimum of five   lbs sandbags in the bed to have any traction at all   this is my only regret   and will buy another with that option when this one is paid for   another problem is portions of missouri roads are horrific   and i have potholes memorized for my route to from work   due to the fact that i have nearly lost control after hitting uneven patches of highway in my   if the patches are unavoidable   the only option is to get off of the gas pedal   and ride out the turbulence   this is a small problem   at least for me   because the bad roads are only in particular areas   i can t fault for missouri s bad highway maintenance   so all in all   i m quite pleased with the
964,1,  we now own our third festiva   well actually the first one was a fiesta   the forerunner of the festiva   it still has the same features actually   i am a happy camper here the durability is tops   the gas mileage is tops   we have traveled numerous miles in this auto spending very little in fuel or maintenance   it s economy features is astonishing   it s rugged and durable   also   cheapest tires on the market if you are looking for economy this is it   if you are looking for luxury forget it   this auto was popular for it s economy   not quality of ride   i do not have a problem with it s ride   etc   i have thoroughly enjoyed each one we have owned    bought all of them used it s sporty look and   cuteness   appeals to the young and old alike   i realize some are eye soars as with any automobile   and it s   savings   appeals to all   it s ease of parking is wonderful   squeeze into those tight spots that others have to drive away from   it has great pick up and go power   i prefer the automatic over the standard any day   however   the standard shift has more go power as with any standard really br br  
965,1,  okay i have to admit this is my first   up until   when i bought my explorer sport new   i had always been a volkswagen girl   i love the way volkswagens handle and look but i spent more time gettin   them repaired then driving   em so in    i decided to shop around for an suv and fell in love with the explorer sport the explorer is the most reliable car i have owned   i never worry about getting stuck somewhere because the engine won t start or having it   die   on the freeway   not fun in l a   i have    miles on it and have only needed routine maintenance on it oil changes   filters   brakes   oh and then there was that minor recall on the tires   of course i m grateful that nobody was ever injured because of my firestone tires   i have to admit though   that in my situation   the recall worked in my favor i had    miles on my car when the recall began and needed new tires i got   brand new tires for free   i should comment that since trading in my firestones for better quality michelins   the ride in much smoother   if you re worried about a   bumpy   explorer   or any other suv   the tires will make all the difference in the world since i don t have children   the   door sport works for me   if you have children or frequent rear seat passengers   you may want to consider the   door   in the sport   the rear seat is not the easiest to get into and getting car seats in and out is time consuming the standard stereo with cd player sounds great speakers are high quality   i can not drive without tunes in my car so this was important to me   the interior is attractive richer looking than other suvs   in my humble opinion and the body style still looks current   despite s yearly body style updates on explorers the mileage is not that great i would say i get on average    mpg and i drive a   speed   still got the original clutch   when i lived   miles from work    miles roundtrip   this was a problem   too much time and money at the gas station   but now that i am   miles from work   i only fill up once a week and am much happier   poor gas mileage comes with owning a big car explorer or other i highly recommend the explorer   people tend to either love or hate fords   i ve heard it all stands for   found on road dead   blah blah blah   but i can t say enough good things about my   it is the best car i have owned   when i first purchased it   i thought i would keep it for     years tops   but why give up a good thing  
966,1,  my husband and i like trucks for the fact that it does anything and everything you want   from moving yourself to transporting our dogs and anything else you need to going over terrain that most cars and some trucks can t even begin to handle   we have the extended cab version and it has six seats total   the only down fall is that the gas mileage is not that great   we average about   miles to the gallon   but there is two tanks that hold   gallons total so it is nice not having to hit the gas station so often   i also like the size you don t feel so small on the road parking is not that great but it is worth it for saftey reasons   i would recommend having a large vehicle for any family   i was in a wreck a drunk driver hit me from behind at about mph while we were sitting at a red light and we felt nothing it took out my bumper but that was all we were fine an the other van was very badly damaged   it pays to have a br br  
967,1,  working for the rescue squad in my city   i occasionally get the chance to drive a crown victoria   we use them as chase cars   basically   but we call them zone cars   when an ambulance responds to a scene   a paramedic can chase the ambulance or beat the ambulance to the scene using one of these cars   response time for paramedics is much more efficient this way   it keeps us extremely mobile   first i need to comment on the handling of these cars   there are plenty of other vehicles out there which would have worked just fine for the job we use the vehicles for   but i can see why the city chose to use these above all others   they handle like a dream   they have a very tight grip on the road   and the steering is not lose at all and has little to no play in it   unlike the majority of built vehicles   the seats   in addition to this   are designed deep in an effort to keep you in place while going around curves   all of these factors take a big role when you are traveling at mph through rush hour traffic with lights and sirens at full blast   with that said   we are glad they have airbags as well   next on the list   the power   i m not sure what size engines these cars are normally sold with   it could be the same size we have   or it might not   the ones we use sport a   l v   i could be wrong though   because they may just very well be sold to the general public the same way they are to us   minus the white paint   reflective stripe down the sides that say rescue   and the red and white strobe light bar on top   considering the size engine they have in them   i have noticed that they still have excellent gas mileage   it usually ranges from   to   miles per gallon   this may not seem like much   but just think of how many times we gun the engine with these cars everyday   also keep in mind that they are usually left running all the time at scenes   for an added bonus   in case most people don t know   strobe lights   sirens   a computer   and several radios draw a lot of power from that hard working alternator   and to make up for it the city sets the engines to run at a high idle   even after all this abuse they can still conserve a considerable amount of gas   now for the room in the vehicle   they have a very large amount of space   we can carry everything an ambulance has on board   with the exception of the stretcher   and still have plenty of room for a couple of passengers   most of the equipment will fit in the trunk   if not all of it if you position it right   along with tools   a jack   and the spare tire   the space in the front is very good as well   located up there is a clipboard   many map books   a mounted computer   several radios   the control panel for the lights and sirens   and yes   still room for passengers   i think these cars are very comfortable    i have to drive them constantly around the city for   hours at a time   and by the end of the day   other than being tired of working   i still feel just as comfortable as i did when i first got into the car   a direct quote given to me from one of the people that spends much of their duty time in a zone car   the city garage maintains the cars   however we still get the chance to see what repairs have been made   if any   they go into the city garage once a month for preventative maintenance   and for the most part   all we have seen done on these cars is fluid changes   engine cleaning   and adjusting the alignment   balance   rotation   and changing tires   i can say that the tires seem to get worn more often than a lot of other cars   but once again   look how we drive these cars   and besides   a different tire brand could help that   but our city is pretty stubborn   once in a great while something other than that will have to be repaired   but what car does that not happen on   if you can find one   let me know because i am going to own one soon   generally speaking   as much as these cars get beat up every day   i am amazed at their ability to stay in great working condition   one owned as a private vehicle would work positive wonders on your maintenance bill   these cars are built very solid   they can absorb much force in a collision   they are designed to do just that   absorb most of the impact and protect the driver   loaded down with brake and sudden motion activated seat belts   dual airbags   shatterless windows   and a crumbling body   they can be trusted to get you to where you need to be safely   they even have a very sturdy roof   if you re wondering where i became familiar of how well the car protects the driver   they have been rolled   wrapped around poles   had head on collisions   been t boned   rear ended   etc   etc   and drivers walked away from all of it with nothing more than seatbelt sores   airbag abrasions   and a bruised ego   statement based on info gathered from sources in this rescue squad   as well as the local police departments   i have yet to wreck one   and i hope i don t  
968,1,  i bought this car as a repairable for   k and i am glad i did   in the condition i have it in now   it is valued at      anyway   it is a great first car for a student and is very safe with dual front air bags   the seating is comfortable for about a few hours   then may get a little tiring   no long road trips   i was a little hesitant to get on the freeway   the car being so small in all   for the first time but a few times after   it was all right   i strongly recommend this car   i have had a great time driving this around town   seeing it is so small   it can go anywhere    not that far in deep snow   trust me on that one   i put a new sony sound system   yes   all sony in a car   it sounds good   in it a few months after i bought it   the previous owner did not take care of the old one   i would recommend the four door model over the two door because it has power steering and it is easier for the rear seat passengers to get in   i would also recommend   for those in the north like me   to get one with a rear defroster or have an after market one installed   i also recommend getting a c   little cars with big windows get pretty warm in the summer   when looking for an aspire   look for one with under    miles i bought mine with    on it and it has run fine   a friend of mine bought one with    and has had to have the transmission and various other things replaced   if was still making the aspire   i would send the     base price and buy another  
969,1,  the contour is a nice   roomy   little sports car that won t sack you in the wallet   it s got the option of a sporty engine   still small liters for good gas mileage   a    liter v   under the hood that packs a little kick behind the pedal   it has a lot of room in the back for all of the passengers or any other cargo that you had to carry   the trunk is really big so you can fit whatever you need it to   the steering is tight and responsive   and the car is solid   i drive cars hard and have yet to have a problem with this one   the stereo is what really shocked me though   for a stock radio and speakers   it really sounds nice   i have the stock tape deck   i don t think that they offer any other options for the radio   but i could be wrong   all in all   the contour is a nice car for a little money if you re in the market for a small compact car   it has good gas mileage   which is necessary for these recent gas price increases and it handles beautifully   the suspension and other parts of the car should last you for a long time   it is a good buy if you want a small car br br  
970,1,  sporty   sturdy   cute    that s what i thought when i first saw the contour on the lot of my local   and thankfully   reputable   used car dealer   overall   i have been very pleased with the gas mileage   drive ability and passenger room   also   the car looks great and   feels   great   all of the buttons are reachable and the cup holders are a great feature here are the issues    the trunk   it leaks   granted   this may have been the result of an unreported collision by the car s first owner   however   it took me three trips to my local dealer   the car was still under warranty   to fix the problem    the recalls   they re copious   every other day i seem to get a friendly   but pointed letter asking me to bring the car back to a licensed dealer for yet another tune up   while i genuinely appreciate s commitment to their drivers   safety   i wish they would iron out these issues before the cars come to market   my mechanic and i are becoming best friends br br  
971,1,  when we purchased our   thunderbird sport with a v and automatic almost   years ago i really had to do some convincing to get my husband to buy a   he has always been a chevy man   i must say   it has turned out to be a really good decision on our part   we wanted something big enough to accommodate   children in the back seat because we weren t ready for becoming a minivan family   and this car is perfect to seat   car seats and another child comfortably in the back my thunderbird has    miles on it and we have only experienced two minor problems   one is the transmission gave out a few years ago and my husband contacted a transmission guy he knows who told him how to fix it with practically a twist of a wrench   of course my husband is a mechanic   so maybe he just made it look easy   it still slips on really cold mornings but it s something i have learned to live with and expect   as soon as the car warms up   the transmission stops slipping the second thing that we have experienced is a headlight problem   we will be driving down the road at night and suddenly the headlights will go out   my husband has replaced the headlight switch and it didn t remedy the problem   a friend of his who owns a says that he also has this problem with his headlights so maybe it is a known problem that can be easily fixed   i don t drive a whole lot after dark so this isn t a real major problem for me but it is quite bothersome when i do have to drive at night those are the only two problems we have ever had out of our thunderbird and it is   years old at this point so i am very impressed with it   and we aren t easy on the old gal either   it has primer on the door panel where i had a slight mishap   and she gets way over due on her oil changes but she just keeps on trucking along for us   i have been really happy with the ride   comfort   and the reliability and i would recommend the   thunderbird to any of my friends br br  
972,1,   cruising in my big t b   i have had my    thunderbird for   years now   bought it way back in my freshman year and it has served me well throughout college   i am a horrible northern driver and brutal on my vehicles   but this piece of craftsmanship refuses to bail out on me   it s a rough and tumble vehicle that remains an incredible deal for the price   especially when bought used from a reputable dealer b the advantages    seat space these are big seats people   with the kind of legroom that only those pretentious you know what s in first class usually get their hands on   and that spaciousness isn t just about spoiling the people up front either   it extends to the back seat as well   which means that everyone feels just a little bit more comfortable and relaxed when you get to wherever you re going and not only are the seats big   but the generous amount of padding in each makes for an especially comfortable ride   appearance i ve gt to admit it to you   i just love the look of the thunderbird   though it is an acquired taste to be sure   i can best describe the style as   quot italian quot   sleek in a chunky way and available in colors   like burgundy   that make it look like a cross between a hit mobile and a hearse   smooth ride riding in my thunderbird has always seemed quite smooth to me   especially when you consider how low to the ground it is   why so low   that kind of positioning allows the thunderbird to provide the rider with great control   as your   quot feel quot   for the road is significantly enhanced in the same arena as the ride is the ease of use of the console   which for me equals smoothness and ease   the thunderbird s radio and air console is incredibly well designed with everything within reach and intuitively organized   seem trivial to you   try changing the station at   miles an hour and see how important knob placement is   trunk this is a important feature for me   as i seem to move every    months   the trunk on the thunderbird is big enough for all of your luggage   not to mention the corpse of vinnie the chin from a rival family b my defense   i have read another review of this vehicle that criticizes the brake quality   and i have to vehemently disagree with it   i ride my brakes hard   and i have never had a lockup or other incident   the brakes do tend to squeek a bit   but the noise is no indication of a performance issue b the final verdict   the bottom line is that the thunderbird is a comfortable and well designed car at a reasonable price   as long as you like burgundy vehicles and live in an area that s at least    italian   the thunderbird is a great option br br  
973,1,  i arrived in the states from australia at the end of march   to stay there for a year and come home at the end of march    i stayed with friends in south carolina who is a man as i have always owned gm or chevs   they lent me a   red corvette until i bought myself a car so after   months i did buy a   z camaro     to fix up and use for the   months after looking at it i thought this was a bad idea so looked in the local paper and found a red   v thunderbird with    miles on it for    after taking it for a test drive offered the lady    and drove it home   it had a slight water leak from the water pump   so while replacing it i installed a set of under drive pulleys   which i could notice the power increase the first time i drove it   put a k amp n air cleaner in as well i had a friend come over from australia so we drove from greenville sc across to sequin tx   did about   miles in that trip   we took the long way   and had no trouble at all and got   mpg sitting on    mph had a radar detector   it has a highway ratio in it    my brother came over from australia so we went from greenville sc down to daytona beach and back   then drove across america to california   which we did about   miles trouble free   when we left williams az the car was buried under snow as we had a cold snap and snow dig the snow away and turn the key starting the engine at once and never missing a beat the car came with the premium sound system   but the radio cassette was playing up so replaced it with a pioneer radio cd i went to the wreckers and bought an electric seat assembly for the right hand side so when converting to rhd will have an electric adjustment   also bought a sports instrument cluster and centre handbrake assy out of a super coupe these cars were never made for export or for right hand drive   so have to get all the parts needed now for conversion i did    miles in   months without the car stopping or letting me down i gave the car   oil changes   added fuel octane booster with every tank of gas   it has the factory   quot   alloy wheels with michelin tyres   i found the car very easy to drive and steer   but did experience brake shudder   which appears to be a common problem due to thin brake rotors i added a rear spoiler and had the windows tinted   which makes the car look sporty   as in australia the only   door cars are mainly jap imports   so in the end i shipped the car back to australia where i have to convert it over to right hand drive for our road rules   this cars owes me     australia    us   landed back at my house in australia   which when converted to rhd they sell from     to        to     us best car i have ever owned br br  
974,1,  this review is about     l coupe   with stick shift i test drove when i considered buying it   i say   considered   because i did not buy it and here is why b test drive   the dealer talked too much during the test drive   they always try to do that to distract you   but i noticed the following things b styling   you can argue   but i think it could be better   the car looks bulky   the c pillars are thick   which increases   blind spots     i was afraid to run over somebody while backing up   the standard wheels look crude   the previous looked more balanced b engine   the   l   hp engine does not seem all that powerful   even with stick   we went on the freeway onramp and i was disappointed   strange   considering the    lb ft of torque rating at as low as   rpm   european and japanese manufacturers manage to extract more than   hp out of    liter engines note   the a c was on during the test drive and was very efficient   it might eat some power   but not that much b transmission   the shifter has quite short travel   which is good   but the clutch does not provide any feedback    you can not feel it engage by the pedal pressure   or the dealer talked too much   the clutch also engaged very high in the pedal travel   i drove some eastern european cars for several years and never had complaints like this one   or maybe i m getting old and grumpy b suspension   the suspension is not only stiff   but creates a lot of unnecessary up and down motions   the car uses live axle in the rear   so i didn t expect much anyway b standard equipment   the list of standard equipment looks good   it includes power windows   mirrors   locks and remote keyless entry   alloy   ugly   wheels   am fm cd cassette player   a c   dual vanity mirrors   etc b interior   interior   materials   fit and finish   looks cheap   i did not expect walnut for   k   but could have done better   as i said   the c pillars are wide   in coupe   and the interior room is smaller than i d like   the steering wheel tilts but does not telescope   which might be a problem for the tall people b insurance and safety   insurance rates are high   especially if you are a male younger than    the crash test results are not encouraging either    the overall rating is   acceptable   with   poor   death rate and   marginal   injury rate b fuel economy   i didn t get a chance to see the actual fuel consumption myself   but on paper it s   mpg city     mpg highway   not impressive for the car of this size with manual transmission b warranty and reliability   b consumer reports b   magazine says that has poor reliability   provides    mile     year warranty and   year corrosion warranty   majority of other manufacturers offers    mile     year powertrain warranty     mile     year warranty for hyundai kia the last three   safety   fuel economy and reliability   also depend on the way you drive b pricing   the price was good   in theory   i know that you can get the car for less than   k   at carsdirect   for example   but the particular dealership i went to wanted more than   k and did not want to negotiate the price at all   besides they were very pushy and rude   needles to say   they did not earn my business   they didn t even try the dealer was constantly asking what monthly payment i can afford   well   i can afford the payment i need to get better car   i walked   after which they called me several times asking how they can make me buy the car   today   i was unable to produce any kind of positive reply on this one i in car buying a lot depends on personal taste   if you like s styling and features and decide to buy it   it is a good deal   providing you with electric everything   remote keyless entry   radio cd cassette   v engine and alloy wheels for less than     if you want refinement   fit and finish   safety and reliability   get ready to pay more for something else i  
975,1,  has made little or no buzz about the fact that the current is based on the current longest living platform in the american auto industry and probably of the american market as well   the current is based in the fox platform first used in the   fairmont    mercury zephyr   maybe they are not sure whether this is a good or a bad thing to let people know   if you ask me i think is a great thing   why   lets see first   was able to retain the rear wheel drive configuration that is the way a pony car is meant to be   in the late   s tried to make a front wheel driver out of the but at the very last minute they backed up   the result was the probe   not a bad car in any respect   but definitely not a   maybe a celica or a prelude but not a second   is really cheap to buy   own   maintain and repair third   has had over   years to improve this platform and it shows    v   convertible ride   the    v   convertible with a stick shift is a really fun car to drive   in a very different and less relaxed way however   than more sophisticated entries in the market   is all about rough power and it shows all the time   is a throw back to the days of the original pony cars but with a very contemporary feel   provided by a extremely well behave steering   quick to respond and very linear   the ride is the best you can expect from a rear wheel driver with a solid axle rear suspension and that does not mean is bad at all   it actually is a very enjoyable ride with a very distinctive american flavor   cowl shake is not nearly as bad as you would expect from a convertible in this price field   but there is some   which i guess is the price you have to pay in exchange for the pleasures of open air motoring   interior   seats are supportive enough if you are not an nba player and there is plenty of space in the front cabin   and nearly none in the back   which anyway is a given in the pony car segment   interior materials are far from being the best and i would advice to take a good look at s accessories catalog to personalize an   although well designed   monochromatic and cheap looking interior   none of the above means that the instrumentation is not well laid out and that controls are not at the reach of your hand when needed power   power is more than adequate    hp inv   form moves the convertible from   to   mph in    seconds   this is former gt territory top   convertible top is simple   fast and powered   two latches   one switch and no roof many may not agree   but to me looks super sexy especially in convertible form the current is the best value you can find if what you are looking for is power   no other car offers you such bang for your buck   now that the camaro    firebird twins were killed by corporate father gm   and those two were super uncomfortable cars anyway the all new   will be based in the dew platform   the state of the art base for the thunderbird   lincoln ls and jaguar s type   that will be a whole different proposition and will see about it then surprisingly good quality
976,1,  the   is a fun car to drive and look at   with its rear wheel drive it handles the corners quite nicely   be careful on wet pavement though   as the tires fight to get traction   the v   engine has some pep in it   this car really takes off from a stand still   passing cars on the highway is not a problem as the engine has a lot in reserve   two small problems with the engine   first   between    mph   the engine seems to lose power and gets sluggish   secondly   when you accelerate it takes a few seconds for the engine to respond   when it does respond   though   you do have some decent power   if you are looking for performance   i would recommend getting the gt   v    when you get to the interior of the car   you start to see where cut costs   the light knobs   a c controls are very cheap looking   if you want rear floor mats for this car   you have to purchase them seperately   the glove compartment is too small   and in a very inconvenient location   i do like the optional mach   audio system   it is well worth the extra money if you want a decent stereo system   the body styling of the is beautiful   many people tend to stare at the longer than most cars one complaint   the front end where the optional flood lights would go   the has some plastic air vents these break easily and it somewhat ruins the look of the car   the antenna is in an awkward place and it also detracts from the look of the   overall   the delivers a decent sports car for the price  
977,1,  with the upcoming demise of the gm f body cars   the remains the first and last of a long breed of american muscle   the   gt certainly holds itself to some pretty steep standards   and it does just fine in meeting them too first off   let s talk power   the thing is rated at hp and    lb feet of torque   for those of you who don t know what those numbers mean   it s fast   at hp it s easily out muscled by camaros and trans ams   but not much   if anything   else in the general price range provides the tire shredding power that a properly driven gt can produce   and the f bodies generally cost a little more anyway   mine is   temporarily   and automatic   so i lose a little in the    and    mile numbers   but it s still no slouch   onramps have never been this much fun and passing is a breeze   the responds well to pressure on the pedal but isn t as harsh as many of the other big v s   with the traction control   it even survives hard mashing on the accelerator so you get some extra traction that s somewhat atypical of rwd muscle   the exhaust looks and sounds good   but i would have preferred a slightly throatier note from it next up is the handling   this thing hugs curves like a car half its weight   you have to be careful because the short   light backend is highly prone to scampering out from under you   but on dry   clean pavement this thing holds the road tight and doesn t let go   just watch it in the rain though   and snow is out of the question on to more practical items   the car is fairly comfortable considering its lineage   i have charcoal gray leather and they look good and feel very supportive   but not hard   the ride is   however   jarring because the suspension is fairly stiff to accomodate it s excellent handling   it can grow tiresome very quickly on constantly rough pavement   also   don t try to shove anyone except the smallest children in the back   anyone over about   years of age is not going to be please with you otherwise gas mileage is acceptable   but this is a moderate size v   so don t expect miracles   i get about    with my driving habits the car   overall   looks good   the interior overcomes the annoying   plastic dollhouse   look and   unlike say the probe   doesn t look cheap and flimsy at all   in fact   what clinched the for me over a brand new tiburon gt   besides the extra power   was the less cheesy looking insides of the   the paint is also very nicely done   the only issue i have with the looks is the plastic inserts in the fake hood scoop and side   vents   from a distance they look fine   but up close they re not very attractive   i might go so far as to recommend actually removing them from the side   vents the only complaints i have otherwise are that the transmission in the automatic is somewhat sloppy for a purported muscle sports car   it doesn t like to shift too hard which hurt performance   however   the stick has issues of it s own   so i would recommend following my lead and just get a good aftermarket system if you don t want to live with the annoyances of the stock   speed and the power loss of the automatic  
978,1,  when picking out my first car   i had a lot of factors i considered   first   i wanted a car that was fun to drive and attractive   i also needed a reliable that was under      at first   i didn t realize that i could afford a     i found a great deal   and purchased my red   it was once a rental car   and it has    miles   there are three types of mustangs   the   horsepower v   the gt v   and the high performance cobra   i purchased the v with the deluxe package    abs   traction control   power seat   spoiler   cd i ve owned the car for about   months   and i haven t encountered a problem yet   the car is very fun to drive   when driving around town   the car quickly accelerates and passing is very easy   however   all this power means below average fuel economy   i ve been averaging   miles per gallon   the steering communicates lots of road feel   and the car handles well   the car has the firm ride of a sports car   and is relatively quiet   the brakes are exceptional inside   the is well finished   the cabin has a high quality feel for the price   all the controls are within reach and very well designed   and the cup holders are of the best in any car i ve seen   the sound system provides great quality   even with the base system   one weakness with the car is the lack of rear seat room   and the small trunk   however   most people in the sports car market don t have a spacious rear seat on the top of their priority list overall   the is an excellent car   a sports car should be fast   attractive   and fun   the has all these qualities and then some   which is why it has been one of america s most popular sports cars for almost   years  
979,1,   captured by the styling b   i have to admit   we were captured by the appearance of the   gt convertible   as teenagers in the early   s   the stying is obviously a through back to that era   we love looks b strong v b   although i wouldn t want to race a   h p   camero ss   the   h p   v   has an amazing amount of power   must have also done their homework in producing the exhaust note of this engine   it has a beautiful   beefy sound under acceleration   but is quiet at steady speeds    small but comfortable on the inside b   i am     and   lbs   but feel very much at home in the cockpit of the   one caveat though   if you opt for standard interior instead of the premium   the seats are much less comfortable   a least for a guy my size   make sure to test both before deciding b good fit and finish b   i have read less then favorable remarks about the fit and finish on the   however   i am very pleased   we own both a new style camero and the   the seems to have more durable components in the cab then our camero   time will tell as we have only had the since june of     relatively poor gas mileage b   to date   i have only one minor complaint about the car it is thirsty   we average   miles to gallon in town   i guess we should have expected this   but i actually thought it might be closer to   
980,1,  i ve been driving a      cylinder    door   wd explorer for six months now   so far it has its ups and downs   the ups   you sit higher and get a better feel for the road   it reacts quicker than most vehicles because of its short wheel base   plenty of room to stretch my big feet   the downs   although better than some suvs it drinks gas like a dog on a hot day   the interior is fairly noisy   it is not the ideal choice for towing large loads the instrument panel is put together very well   it is easy to read and everything important is exactly where you want it to be   the back seats fold down easily to make an eight foot bed   plenty of room for spreading out a sleeping bag i wish it had a cable release for the back window   the back door   which lifts up   has a glass that can also be opened up   ideal for putting small items in the back without having to put all you weight into shutting the big door   this window lacks a release from the inside   you have to open it from the back door i titled this review   quot explod er quot   because of the tire incident this past summer   i believe you should really look hard at this vehicle before buying it   the explorer certainly fits some lifestyles   but for others there are better vehicles br br  
981,1,  i have purchased an   sho sedan with k miles     in    vs     book   and a   lx sedan with k miles     in    vs     book   both were mint condition   no damage and like new inside and nearly new outside   both have proven to be solid cars   reliable   and safe   however   if you are considering these vehicles   you must get them at a price that allows you to address the maintenance and repairs that are common to this vehicle   the repairs that will typically cause the owners to sell are front axle boots drive joints   engine rear seal   oil leak   and cooling system leaks   particularly the heater block which is inside the fire wall and very difficult to replace   at times there can be engine block problems   particularly with the    engine   usually caused by people driving away without allowing some warm up time i didn t have the vehicles checked by a mechanic   i used my relatively good judgment on condition   after investing     in the   and    in the   sho   i have two vehicles that are in my opinion as good as new   certainly good for    to    more    i care for my vehicles   currently with a corsica   at    and still going strong since i was buying very well cared for cars and still had to pay for major repairs   i urge you to only purchase one of these vehicles at below book   even below average wholesale   for example   my sho carried an average wholesale over    and retail     but i bought for     you must anticipate these repairs   if the seller does not believe you   go to the ntsb web page and printout the repair and recall lists for the taurus in those years and show them what to expect   i do not wish to scare you away with these stories   these are very good   solid cars if you find well cared for ones   however   the design has flaws which once fixed    and usually with upgraded redesigned parts that replaced the original design   you end up with a super   very reliable car   just anticiate the extra investment these are solid   heavy cars that even with no airbag or one airbag will often in an accident hammer the other vehicle as hard as a suv   remember   bulk and weight are very important when in an accident   the heavy guy usually wins   the sho has a   speed   the lx an automatic   the lx is loaded with everything like climate control   electric seats   etc   all continue to work well   the sho has many sport car luxuries   such as sun roof   fog lamps   powerful engine   etc   the automatic has had no problems   but the clutch plate for the sho must be upgraded because the original is too weak   and will fail   if this was not done by the original owner   anticipate a    repair   by an honest good reasonable shop   twice that by a dishonest shop br br  
982,1,  the   year taurus is a excellent family car there is ample room for cross town trip or cross country trips   the taurus gives you a very reliable means of transportation and you get very good gas mileage on average i get   mpg in town and   mpg highway   this car is a good car for some one with a family but i would not recommend that you get a taurus for a young adult if they a sports car kind of driver it is not made to be driven like that   the taurus does have very well take off and is a very reliable car and very comfortable car to drive or ride in br br  
983,1,  i bought this taurus used in   for       with    miles on it and have had it ever since   i have kept up with the maintenance   and the car has served me well   it only left me stranded once during all these years   and even then the mechanics could not figure out what had happened   it would not do that ever again the car rides comfortably and the radio works well   i am still on the original   factory radio   the display has long burned out   but i have memorized all my presets repairs have included   replaced alternator and battery in the fall of    replaced front shocks in spring of    replaced water pump in the fall of    replaced a c system in june   considering the age of the car   it is not too bad   i have    miles on it and will drive it till it disintegrates into small particles  
984,1,  the ubiquitous minivan is frequently sold on consumer feel good items such as the placement and size of cup holders   the presence of map pockets or the number of zones in which the climate control can be split    s   windstar   does well on these creature comfort areas   but excels in safety and reliability    critical areas for the family oriented minivan market segment   i just spent a week driving the windstar through a variety of street and weather conditions   this is the third minivan i ve test driven in the last five months   and so far   is my favorite   i still haven t driven the   honda odyssey   which has better all around numbers   but the   windstar performs better than the plymouth grand voyager and its caravan twin    since this was s baby to begin with   that s a hard statement to write   but has done a terrific job with this van b the ride   feel the acceleration   the windstar has plenty of get up and go   there s a    liter v with   hp   more of both than the odyssey or the grand caravan   this van has torque to spare with   foot pounds at   rpm   again better than both vehicles   i found myself passing slower moving vehicles with just a tap on the responsive accelerator   there was always plenty of power left over to respond to changing road conditions i also found the ride itself to be smooth   the windstar weighs a good   pounds more than the grand voyager   and although neither are in serious big suv territory at just under   pounds   they are solid   the windstar s wheelbase is bigger than i would have liked   at over   inches   contributing to a bigger than expected turning radius   several times i found myself faced with the choice of making a three point turn or doing some curb cutting   i knew that acceleration was there for some reason the windstar s critics have complained of the same top heavy   swaying feeling i found in the grand voyager    i didn t find much swaying at all   even when accelerating in curves    in fact   the biggest criticism i could find on the ride was that there is a small but significant blind spot just off the right rear bumper   some jiggling with mirrors restricted from field of vision to other sides   but stopped me from driving several smaller cars off the road b safety   let s face it   families buy minivans   and along with reliability   family buyers treasure safety above every other attribute   airbags   including side airbags   are standard on this vehicle   but that only comprises a small portion of safety   the national highway traffic safety administration   nhtsa or nhtsa gov   is the agency responsible for crash testing vehicles for the federal government   they gave the windstar   stars out of a possible   for crash worthiness   a safety group run for the insurance industry   the highway loss data institute   found that the addition of the side air bags made the windstar one of the safest passenger van in its   mph crash tests   the van finished third behind the toyota sienna and honda odyssey in their tests   this was actually a step down for the windstar   which used to be rated as best in its class   but the odyssey s redesign catapulted the   model over the windstar   still   these three vehicles were the only ones to receive hldi s overall   good   rating in their class self sealing tires and a reverse sensor system that alerts the driver when the rear bumper is within five feet of something are safety options that are well worth considering   has packaged multiple options into several safety packages   so depending on what you want to put on your van   you might find it cheaper to buy a package than to add single options b creature comforts   the very first thing i noticed when i settled into the driver s seat was the ledge over the window well   it s a perfect height for resting a driver s arm   yes   i know you should drive with two hands on the wheel   these little things   like the aforementioned cup holders and map pockets   make a surprising amount of difference in overall consumer protection   and speaking of the cup holders   the two recessed under the ashtray in the front were adjustable and fit different sized cups with a simple squeeze of the ratcheted plastic ring   i was very impressed with the interior lighting   which gave plenty of directed illumination at night without making it difficult to continue driving   even the climate controls for the passengers in the rear two rows are illuminated at night    a nice feature that not every minivan shares the stereo was big and bold sounding with the requisite tuning and pseudo equalizer buttons   i particularly liked the oversized radio station buttons the stems off the steering wheel were the only item that caused me concern   on the right side stem   the driver finds the gear shift lever with the overdrive button recessed into the tip   that s simply annoying design   but the dangerous design is on the left side stem which controls turn signals and dual interval wiper systems   on more than one occasion   i signaled for a left turn only to unexpectedly spray the windshield with fluid and start the wipers   the turn signal control is a silly place to put a wiper button anyway   that said   the dual interval wipers are neat and do a tremendously good job in maintaining visibility through even heavy rain interior visibility is terrific   however   thanks to a mini mirror that swings down between the driver and passenger seats in front   this is not intended as a rear view mirror   but as a way to watch folks even in the back row   parents with kids are going to love this feature because it doesn t detract at all from the rear view mirror and is easily seen from either driver or passenger seat finally   the killer comfort issue was found on the fourth door   yes   the windstar is available as a four door unit too   perfect for families who can enter on driver or passenger side   i also found that the bucket seats in the second row were nice and roomy while the third row bench seat easily folded down or was removed    the bottom line   auto dealers are still getting near sticker price for the honda odyssey   last year s minivan darling   if price is a factor at all   i find that the windstar stacks up very favorably against the odyssey and now is the time to buy   models since the s are now in stock   is also trying to move the   units and has a    customer cash offer out through october    that gets you    of the way there if you use the money down   and based on your trade   you might even be able to lower your payments if you mix    cash back with a credit apr offer   until i get a chance to drive the odyssey   s windstar has leaped to the top of my minivan list     
985,1,  this is my first vehicle that is not a car   i have never owned a motorcycle   motorhome   pickup truck or anything else other than mostly big roomy sedans   i like my creature comforts when tooling down the highway enroute to one golf resort or another   with about a year left to go on the oldsmobile i got to thinking about minivans   and decided to do some research   i relied   too   on a friend who is now in his third straight minivan   no fords for advice on what   besides the cupholders   are the advantages of minivan ownership   i used the internet to do the research   relying heavily on kelly blue book   kbb    and edmunds   both are really good sites whether you are buying or leasing   and whether it s a car or a truck   bottom line is that between them and my buddy   although he is absolutely not a windstar guy   i decided that if i was getting a minivan it was going to be s   it was a close call over the honda odyssey   truth is there are a lot of great vehicles out there nowadays   maybe you won t go wrong with any of them   but i am thinking that for the money you can t get much safer or more comfortable   i ve been driving mine now for about four months   and i believe that i am ready to evaluate it   i don t know much at all about the technical stuff   but i do know that i am satisfied with the gas mileage   the ride is nice   of course   when your vehicle is new you are careful to miss most bumps larger than a bottlecap   but nevertheless i did not miss a few and i can tell you from experience   it s a nice ride   i got the se model with the   quot radar quot   in the back   that s the rear sensing system that saved me from an accident in a supermarket parking lot this past week   i never saw the guy   and i never would have had a chance if it wasn t for that alarm going off just in the nick of time   it s been the better part of   thirty years since i hit something i wasn t aiming at   and i can tell you i am real grateful for this alarm system   it would have been a minor ding i am sure   but it would have ruined a great driving record   thanks again   if this model doesn t have enough bells and whistles for you   well i got ta tell you that you are pretty spoiled   no matter though   they have two others   i think   loaded with even more stuff if you have to have it   the right side back door opens and closes at the push of a button   that s pretty neat   makes me wish i had gotten the left door that way too   you know what else is pretty neat   the outside mirrors    not only are they   quot powered mirrors quot   they are heated   to melt the ice which we will be getting our fair share of starting any day now   no more scraping mirrors   works for me   i could go on with what i like about it   but if you re looking to buy one of these or one of the competition s versions   then i better tell you what i don t like about it as well   got ta be fair   the right front door can not be opened with a key    there is no keyhole   my vehicle has   quot keyless entry quot   so i shouldn t complain   but i don t keep that little   quot doo jigger quot   on my keyring   it s my emergency backup in case i stupidly leave my keys in the car   again   and sometimes it would be handy to access that door with a key   for someone else or for packages   for example   i am not crazy about my cupholders   the ones in the front section of the car just under the radio that you have to pull out like a drawer   well   they re a little chintzy if you ask me   i don t trust them to hold my medium diet pepsi   and they don t hold my coffee mug   so   what are they good for   like the song says   quot absolutely nothin quot   the only other thing that really bugs me is the back door lift gate or whatever they call it   if anything ought to be   quot powered quot   this is it   i m guessing that if there is one feature that costs the most customers this would have to be it   i believe that the people would do well to hire themselves a woman engineer to check this door out from the point of view of people who are less than       and make it so it s a wee bit more user friendly   dumbest door i ve ever seen   if you are thinking minivan for your next purchase   you might want to just take my word for it   i did the research   windstar is a good deal br br  
986,1,  i ve recently purchased a   windstar lx   we traded in our   windstar and are very pleased with the refinements that has continued to make to the windstar with each successive model year was a little late in adding the   fourth sliding door   option and quite frankly they were probably caught a little bit by surprise when chrysler introduced this innovation to the minivan market a couple of years ago   but while chrysler and gm were adding the additional door was continuing to place an emphasis on safety and ride quality   the windstar is the only domestic mini van with a   star collision rating and for the year   side impact air bags are an option   the windstar is adequately powered   however   you pay dearly for the additional boost in the anemic gas mileage you ll get   the windstar has a decent road feel but steering can at times feel vague   but the windstar is relatively easy to maneuver   is quiet and is quite pleasant to drive and ride in   the captains seats are well padded and comfortable and are quite improved from earlier models   the   way power driver s seat option with lumbar support adjustment is highly recommended also   optional is on the lx is remote controlled automatic passenger s side sliding door   this is a great convenience when toting small children   also offers a premium sound package with a cd player as an upgrade for about     the sound is exceptional for a factory installed system   also   recommended is the rear heat and air option   this allows all passengers to ride in comfort the styling on the   model has also been refined   the front end is more rounded   imitating chrysler s styling initiatives   but on the plus side this also seems to have improved visibility over the front nose of the van   next time your in a parking lot look at all the bent front license plates on earlier windstar models   due to poor visibility over the nose   windstar drivers were are constantly hitting parking rail guards   a minor irritation becomes evident in rainy conditions you ll notice that the rear window wiper only seems to clear about half   the driver s side   of the window   while i personally didn t have any problems with my   model   my sister had some of the renowned windstar problems with her   model   head gasket   electrical   and has vowed never to purchase another   however   from the group of people i know she is the only one to have serious problems with the windstar   chrysler and gm have had there own share of problems   mainly transmission related with their minivans   if you are in the market for a minivan and safety and comfort are a priority i d highly recommend that you test drive the windstar   i think you ll agree that it compares quite nicely to its competitors br br  
987,1,  we bought our new   windstar last october and have been extremely happy with our purchase so far   there have been no mechanical problems at all here are some of the features that we like best about our windstar it drives much more like a car than a van   it doesn t have that top heavy   awkward van feeling to it on corners   we were also impressed with the amount of pep the engine has   while it s not a porsche   it does have very impressive acceleration for a van    much more similar to a car again than to other vans i have driven on the back of the back seat there are these great little hooks that you can use to hook grocery bags onto when you go shopping   this seems like a small feature   but we really love it   you no longer have to worry about the ice cream falling onto it s side and leaking   and you never have to repack your bags with all the items that spilled out during the drive home the idea of removable seats is great   we often take them out when we go camping and put a mattress in the back   it makes for an extremely comfortable sleep   the only thing that would be better would be if they could make the seats lighter   you need to be fairly muscular to take out the single seats   we took the four bucket seats in the first two rows and the bench at the back option   while the bench seat at the back is really a two person job to remove and reinstall having the sliding doors on both sides is a very helpful feature that allows you to easily access just about anywhere in the vehicle   we used ours to move across the country   and found it very helpful in packing and accessing our belongings once they were packed in we were quite impressed with the stereo system   before hearing it   we had discussed having a better system installed   but once we had our first listen   we decided we d keep the factory installed model the climate control system is quite good for the people in the front two seats   from a cold start it heats up or provides air conditioning very quickly   however there are no air vents to provide circulation to passengers in the back   a couple of times now when we ve had a full load of people   we have either had to bake or freeze in the front to keep our passengers in the back comfortable   i m not sure if there was an option to have rear climate controls   but if there is it will be something we will think about getting next time   we don t often have many passengers   so it hasn t been too big of a problem for us   but if you frequently carry a full load of passengers   it s something you might really want to think about   i should add that there are two windows at the back that open slightly to help with air circulation   which is great for your passengers when it s hot and you don t want to use air conditioning   the tinted windows that we opted for help with this too finally   if you like to bring beverages in the car with you   there are more cupholders in the van than you would believe  
988,1,  we recently traded in our   caravan for a   windstar   we had had the caravan for three years   and i was very happy with it   so when it came time to make the change   i was a little leary   however   i found that the windstar had almost all the features that i had had in the caravan   when i found out that the windstar had a five star safety rating   i was convinced   the first time i drove our new windstar   i was amazed at the amount of power it had   our caravan had always been rather sluggish when pulling out of our driveway and onto our uphill street   but the windstar took right off   i ve been guilty of giving it too much gas many times   because i expect it to need the extra push   it doesn t   one of the most important features to me   especially with getting three kids in and out   is the sliding door on the driver side   i was so glad to hear that the new windstars had this   it makes it so much easier getting small children and packages in and out   without having to climb all the way inside   plus   i feel much safer   knowing that if we were in an accident   there would be better accessibility to my children   the windstar is also a much heavier vehicle   it does not get swayed by the wind nearly as much as the caravan   i feel that it would hold up in a collision much better than the caravan   i feel much safer driving the windstar   knowing that it has a good safety rating   i have three children of my own   and always have my friends   children in the car as well   so safety is extremely important to me   the only thing missing from our new windstar is the built in child restraints in the middle seat   i don t use them for my own children   but it is handy to have when extra kids are in the car unexpectedly   these are available in the windstar   but we did not want to add the cost of having them installed   our new windstar is a beautiful vehicle   it is practical and safe   i would recommend it to anyone br br  
989,1,  being a young   single person   such as myself   there is not much of a need for a minivan   but i checked it out nonetheless   aesthetically   it has the same look and feel of other minivans   but with a significant advantage   upon getting into the minvan   you first notice the room    no more cramped legs up front or in the rear   with plenty of room to add accessories   such as a console for beverages cd s tapes etc   space aside   the seats also have a great deal of maneuvering power   so it is definitely possible to achieve that comfortable position you had in the last car   another plus is the rear sliding door   as there is one on either side of the minivan   no more line ups to get inside the van once the seat is adjusted and you turn the engine on   surprise   a nice   healthy engine with no obtrusive noises   after you hit the gas pedal and start driving   you notice the immense power this vehicle has    it is so smooth and able to achieve your desired speed rather quickly   it s almost like driving a car   when driving uphill   you never fell the need to   quot floor quot   it   just to be able to drive above   miles an hour when you see the light ahead about to turn red and get ready to hit the brakes   the windstar brakes so effortlessly   coming to a complete stop exactly where you want to stop   even for those sudden slam on the brakes moments   you will notice that this vehicle does not at all jerk you forward   it adjusts were well to abrupt and harsh driving conditions the only downside is inside the minivan   parents may notice that the rear window latches are a little on the clumsy side   and have the potential to result in jammed little fingers while this isn t necessarily the most affordable minivan   it is a good complete package   boasting a modern appearance and a good ride   making this a very good choice for people who need the roominess of a minivan   but don t like traditional minivans br br  
990,1,  we ve had our   windstar sel since july    it s a much nicer   more refined vehicle than our previous astro and plymouth voyager   here are the things we like best about our windstar   the ride is very comfortable   the interior is very comfortable   the controls are laid out logically   the rear ventilation system works great   the seats are relatively comfortable   and the power side doors work perfectly   the styling is gorgeous   even though the windstar design is getting a little old   it s still the most distinctive   beautiful minivan on the road   safety   five stars   front and side airbags   reverse sensing system   anti lock brakes   traction control   conveniences   like cup holders   rear passenger ventilation system controls   power side doors   and the entertainment system   they all work great concerns   long term reliability   so far   we ve had the van into the dealer for   minor recall issues   replacement of the intake manifold   replacement of the front disc brake rotors   and replacement of a front seat belt buckle to repair the malfunctioning seat belt warning system   these are relatively minor issues   but i am concerned about long term reliability because we plan on keeping this van for many years   leg room for rear seat passengers is extremely limited   our sons are   and   and sometimes groan when they re relegated to the back seat as i said   this is our third minivan   our kids are      and   and we ve worn out a chevy astro and plymouth grand voyager through the years   by far   the windstar is the most comfortable   user friendly minivan we ve owned   it s holding up well to kid abuse and the normal wear and tear of daily life   the reliability issues concern us a little   but it looks like we have the bugs worked out now   we re looking forward to many years with our windstar   it s too bad   however   that this will likely be our last minivan   by the time we wear this one out   our   older kids will be off to college and all we ll need is a car   that ll be a switch i d recommend the windstar to anyone   it s relatively spacious   comfortable   safe   fun to drive   and a good value  
991,1,  first i ll say this   the    and   to some extent   the    windstar sucked   reliability wise   the   model was the first model year   so it s sort of understandable   the   year had transmission problems and all sorts however   the new vans are great several people i know have windstars of various vintages           only the guy with the   has had problems my family has rented   windstars   a      and    each for over a month   we used them for long drives   we went two days constantly on the highway and also around town   we ve been completely impressed with all of them   the interior is humungous   every time we rented a windstar   it was used to haul   people and luggage on long trips   no problem   still comfy for everyone in the van   the only complaint was with the   model    the air conditioning wasn t very good in the back bench   however   this was completely fixed in the   and   models we rented all the vans were very comfortable   and the sound systems were excellent   important if you are on long trips   they all had the   l v and drove nicely   especially the    absolutely nothing went wrong with any of them   including the    and we were so impressed that we nearly bought one   we decided on a focus   because we don t really   need   the extra space i highly reccommend the windstar   but only models from   and on   this is the van for families tips   don t get a windstar without the   l v engine   the extra power is very nice   and the engine is smoother br br  
992,1,  we have had   windstars in the past   years   but we didn t trade in because of any problems   we traded it in to get a newer model and we are not sorry   we love our windstar   the ride is superb and quiet   it is so comfortable to travel in   we ve been to niagara falls   canada   toronto and montreal also   and we ve also done closer trips to vermont   new hampshire   rhode island   we are from massachusetts   i have never had any problems to speak of with these vans and love the dependability of them   there s plenty of room for a family and cargo too   the seats are very comfortable   i happen to like fords anyway   haven t had any complaints in the   years we ve had them in our family   so i have good reason to stay with them   our van also has the automatic sliding door in the right rear   we especially love that convenience   when you re bogged down with tons of shopping bags from a shopping day at the mall you really appreciate this feature  
993,1,  we did extensive research and drove every mini van in town   this is the fifth mini van that we have owned   but the first   we love the car   the built in tv and vcr are wonderful for the kids   the car rides beautifully   has lots of room   nice features   and is generally a perfect car   so far     months   we haven t found anything about this car that we do not like   it even gets better mileage than was advertised   we recommend this car with no reservations   for the first time   we have chosen to lease   and this is also a good experience   we plan to get another windstar in   years   and our lease payment is only    per month br br  
994,1,  i bought my bronco in    it was an    xlt with only    miles on the clock   and it showed   the    is the same as the     which is why i posted it here   i bought this vehicle because i was moving to northern iowa and i had a wd   gmc sierra classic with    on the clock   and needed something new for iowa s winter weather   this bronco was a one owner and i paid a fairly reasonable price for it   people who don t know much about truck models think it is new   there is plenty of interior space   and seats   very comfortably   no one has to ask me to move my seat up   it has a   v   which is plenty of power for this vehicle   the previous owner towed his rv with this rig   i have actually tried to get this tank stuck and had difficulty at doing so with the   quot   tires it is equipped with right now   as a previously stated   this bronco is a tank   it is   years old and runs great   sounds great   and looks great   one thing broncos tend to do is wander when traveling in a straight line   it is not recommended for people who will only drive it around town   elderly people and or people wearing skirts   dresses   or high heels may have trouble climbing in this vehicle   you must also be prepared to get    mpg   and even lower in four wheel drive   the bronco is great for someone who needs a dependable   powerful   and comfortable four wheel drive vehicle at a reasonable price     
995,1,  i have already written an epinion about a   that i used to own   but last week i traded it in for a   model   this time i decided to go with the off road package which gave me the    liter v i love the power   a few nice emenities are a center counsel   five speed tranny   larger wheels and tires   and a hard tonneau cover   as for how it rides   it s pretty smooth   much better than i had expected out of a truck with an off road package   i also like the fact i sit higher than most other traffic   that is except for the onslaught of suburbans and expeditions   i am pretty comfortable driving this truck   it s a little cramped but tolerable   i m about average height    feet   so my legs are bent a little bit but it s not like my knees are rubbing on the steering wheel or anything   i don t think i can say enough about the acceleration and towing power of this truck i love it   after driving the standard   l for awhile it sure is nice to have a little something behind the gas pedal again   just to test it i tried towing my dad s car trailer   with my mom s bravada on it   to see how it did and it handled it with no problem   now i can t wait for summer to take the boat or jet skis out   one draw back to the extra power is the extra cost of gas   i don t think this is all directly due to the larger displacement though   now that i have a little power i m putting my foot in it a lot more as well   but on the highway it s getting right around    mpg br br  
996,1,  i give this truck a definite thumbs up   it is affordable and good looking   the have come a long way since they first were introduced   this pickup truck has taken me where i wanted to go   and for a reasonable amount of money   there is nothing in this world that could compare to getting in my truck and taking it wherever i want to   it goes when you want it to   that s why i chose this truck   although it is a challenge in the snow   i find that the good far more than outweighs the bad   it is comfortable   but could use a little extra leg room if you ask me   to drive this vehicle feels   secure   it s a safe vehicle   and knowing that makes it much easier   and more fun to drive   for someone who is looking for a powerful   safe   rugged midsize pickup   this is the truck i   personally   would suggest checking out br br  
997,1,  when i set out to purchase a new auto   i did not really give the explorer that much consideration   but   now   after owning it for just over a year   i can say that i am truly pleased with it   i was impressed with how much you can tow   the pulling power of the engine   and the stereo is not too shabby in my occupation i am sometimes required to bring a lot of gear with me and i kind of wish that the cargo area was bigger   but   the explorer is still larger that chevy   i think that while driving at a high rate of speed on the highway   the exterior sound is too great to enjoy the stereo   i wish did a little bit more to make the auto more to insulate the exterior noise   in my occupation i am sometimes required to bring a lot of gear with me and i kind of wish that the cargo area was bigger   but   the explorer is still larger that chevy   i think that while driving at a high rate of speed on the highway   the exterior sound is too great to enjoy the stereo   i wish did a little bit more to make the auto a little bit more to insulate the exterior noise   oh ya   last night while driving to work   i got a flat   i think that engineer who designed the tire changing system   never had to use this system   it was a real pain i think that i like suv s more simply because sitting at a higher elevation   you get to see more of the road and it gives you time to mentally digest more information in a timely manner   when i was a truck driver   this is one thing that i found to be of particular value when driving long hauls   i like the seats   they have found to be comfortable on long or short drives   i think that the side step bars or great for my wife   who is a little vertically challenged   my kid uses them as well to climb up and out of the auto   pleased i got it overall  
998,1,  my wife and i bought a   f crewcab a little over a week ago   everything we wanted was not on the vehicle   but it was a good compromise   our intended uses for this truck include hauling our cattle to market   farm chores   and occasionally hauling the family around two adults three teenagers and one younger   we sat the kids in an extended cab to check legroom and found that size coming up short   when i drive   i don t care for kids knees in my back   once we had decided on the vehicle size that fit us   we realized only made a well equipped truck that large   we looked at the commercial pamphlet and decided for long life the    liter v and heavy duty automatic transmission would be able to perform the tasks we were buying the truck for   it is a stout engine   and has torque that becomes available at a lower r p m   than the chevy   v   driving home and subsequently   i have found the to be quiet   with a high quality ride more at home on a car than a truck   we have driven bumpy roads to test the ride quality as well as the ability of the cd player to withstand bumps without skipping   and it passed   the power trailer mirrors are great and the amount of glass in the body lets you see forever almost   the gas mileage is about normal for a truck   perhaps slightly better than i had thought for a large engine i enjoy driving this truck   it is comfortable and not bouncy   i put a half ton of feed in the back and didn t notice any difference   i would have liked the captains chairs and a different color   but i am happy with the purchase and it looks like it will last for years   
999,1,  we have now had our v f for   years we bought one of the first   s back in october    the truck has an automatic and the v engine having bhp and around ft lb torque   its a pulling monster   we have the truck set up with    rear gears it is not a four wheel drive   we pull a   foot boat weighing in with trailer gas and all of us at about   lbs   the truck still runs like there is no weight behind it   gas mileage drops from about   to   to around   to   depending on speed we have found that about   is the best speed to gas mileage ratio   the interior of the truck is wonderful it is a xlt with all options   it has a cd player which could be better   the air is ice cold and the heater blows out air hot enough to burn you   it relativley quiet inside the main thing you hear is the ten cylinders in front of you working   room in the back is exceptional   room in the front is more then anyone would ever need   we have taken the truck on many vacations and it has gotten about   miles to the gallon then not to bad for a   l engine   with a roll top cover the bed is virtually waterproof and lockable  
1000,1,  hot rod trucks are not a new form of radical transportation by any means   however really is on the proverbial   ball   when it comes to this one   add an intercooled supercharger to s already potent triton    liter overhead cam v engine   then drop it into a lowered f   with a dramatically stiffened suspension and huge disc brakes   and voila   you have the worlds coolest hot rod production truck   not to mention   at the time   the fastest i driving impressions i    a ny full sized pickup truck gives you that sense of power    most notably the   rams   towering over small passenger cars   in the case of the   f   lightning though   the feeling is enhanced   with   horsepower at your right foot coupled to a silky smooth   speed automatic transmission don t expect a boring ride   in terms of   acceleration    the   f   lightning is astonishing   ripping    in under   seconds and to   mph in an estimated    seconds   according to many specs   unlike most trucks where weight and poor aerodynamics come into play at around   or so mph   the lightning pulls far past that   add flat   neutral cornering with excellent grip   responsive steering   and very supportive seats   and the mixture is just about perfect for a hot rod show truck    svt     special vehicles team   selected the    liter triton v offered in the f   and expedition as the powerplant for the   lightning   very good idea if you ask me   the    found in the mustangs would have lacked torque and power if they would have selected that particular engine   the trition was conceived primarily to deliver a lot of low rev torque   lb   ft     rpm   with a smaller bore than stroke of      x     realizing that the lightning buyers would want substantially more horsepower   some significant changes were made over its predecessor and its lesser models   the main power increase came by way of an intercooled eaton series ii supercharger   also found the jaguar xjr   the v got a special forged steel crankshaft   sinter forged alloy rods   and special dished alloy     compression pistons   a larger     dual bore throttle body was also installed    suspension b   the basic ladder type separate frame as used on all f s is retained for the lightning   as is the basic suspension   short long arms up front and a leaf sprung live axle out back   modifications include a lower height   recalibrated springs   modified shocks   thicker anti roll bars   and some massive   four wheel vented disc brakes i interior accommodation i   the   interior   of the f   lightning is very much like the regular f s   all lightnings comes with split bench seats with center arm rests and storage bins   the steering wheel is thick and meaty   the stereo system in my test truck was not stock   it was a   speaker alpine system   but from what i hear they came with   excellent sounding   stock sound systems   the gauge s are white   giving you that sporty feel while looking at your speedometer rise    same gauges that are in the svt   these gauge s can be found in a number of performance automobiles   there is plenty of room for   adults   and the seats are very supportive   and comfortable to boot   like the regular f s for    model year   the lightning is very   car like   in configuration   the drivers position is especially good allowing for easy access to the hvac controls and all of the gadgetry in the cabin i exterior innovation i   the   exterior    while not as bold as the   ram or any current generation ram   is much more bold than the regular f s   there is no confusing a f   lightning with a regular f    or any truck on this planet for that matter   the f   lightning comes with side exhaust   a very cool feature   would have been better if it had dual side exhaust   a svt badge of honor in the rear   huge    rims matched with high performance tires   and an aggressive nose lets other drivers know this is one serious truck   all lightnings get the practical and convenient opening rear window   red   black   or white   in all three of the available colors   the f   lightning radiates real aggression and style with its lowered stance and sexy five spoke alloy rims   and body extensions   because of how collectible these trucks are   the   price   is actually higher then what they were back in    i have seen f   lightnings go for around      new   these trucks had a msrp of around     even i conclusion i while most owners will not utilize the power provided in the lightning   the lightning offers amazing performance attributes   this vehicle may not be the best for off road use   in fact off road use is best avoided   however this type of a truck is one that will turn heads and burn rubber   fair enough trade off   the lightning is recommended    to anyone looking for an exclusive   non off road   hot rod production truck looking to read about another truck   you may want to check out     a href content    my review on the ram a     happy car shopping  
1001,1,  i utilize a f   xl model through work   it s a base model featuring a   speed   titan v   and a tape deck   this truck is abused   numerous people drive it for deliveries   getting supplies   and weekend use   there is no doubt in my mind it takes a beating   i have to say it s durability has impressed me   our truck is approaching k in mileage and the only work required has been regular maintenance and self induced   the later primarily refers to several flat tires   a broken front grill   someone bumped on of our bigger trucks   and a sheared off lug on the right rear wheel   you can see what i mean about abuse   however   the drive train remains quite solid   considering the base model   and i drive it in workboots   the thing picks up quite good   and breaks loose quite easy   rain is the biggest enemy   as with most trucks   that big v   will break the wheels loose quickly and efficiently   the ride is comfortable considering it s work status   it equipped with a basic cloth benchseat   i ve made several day long runs in it and it could be more comfortable   but it could be a lot worse   the lack of cruise control is a bigger factor to me than the seats   the bed is sized to hold most of what we need   the tailgate easily disconnects if necessary   nice feature   this truck has an excellent utility aspect   and i would recommend it to any fleet or local shop   however   if your shopping for a personal truck   i would recommend a better equipped model   the build quality is certain to be the same   but you don t want that bench seat br br  
1002,1,  late in the summer of    my husband and daughter were in an accident that left our   lumina minivan totaled   we spent the next month searching for a replacement   when buying a new vehicle   my husband and i have different priorities   my concern is generally limited to the passenger area and comfort   while he is concerned about what is under the hood   we both have been very pleased with the minivan we chose   a   windstar   after test driving many new and used minivans   the first thing i noticed when i got into the windstar was how well built and sturdy it felt   it handled well   and was very comfortable   i liked how the instrument panel was designed    everything was easy to find   and clearly labeled   i was also impressed with the amount of space there was   both leg room and hauling space   the rear bench seat can be moved to the center   allowing even more space in back   i also noticed the arm rest by the window   a person in the front seat doesn t need the window down to rest their arm as if it were   every seating position was comfortable   and the upholstery and door design were very pleasing to the eye   having the second sliding door is something we wanted   as was keyless entry   no more fumbling for keys in the rain   the windstar had everything we wanted   and two hours later it was ours   i realize that engine power and size are important   and my husband is very pleased with that aspect of our new van   of course   safety played an important part of our decision   and the windstar consistently ranks among the safest   if you want comfort along with reliability in a minivan   i highly recommend the windstar     
1003,1,  everyone who knows something about cars   and or anything about the windstar then they know it is a very praised van    star crash test rating   what could be more important   numerous awards   and more   this is arguably the most popular mini van on the market   for good reason i ve owned a winstar for about a year and a half now and have had no real problems to date   this is a very reliable car   not to mention its performance   this car still has that new car feel when you first test drive it   it is very smooth running   another thing that is great about the windstar   is that it is a   what car has the experience that does   with you know that you are getting a good quality automobile that will last you for many years to come   for instance   my father just sold his   f    which was in perfect condition from the inside   the body was somewhat rusted   and it turned out to be a bargain from the price he paid for it to last him   years with very minimal visits to the shop back to the windstar itself   if you have a large family   or even a small one   you can not go wrong with this car   just by looking at you can tell it has   quot family car quot   written all over it   it s perfect to take the kids on long trips and the car is very versatile   all in all the windstar is a great car that you and your family will enjoy for a long while br br  
1004,1,  is making it very easy to find a windstar that fits you   first   its only real competition this model year is the new honda odyssey and good luck finding one of those   second   credit is willing to throw free money at buyers who rate it   third   the windstar can be dressed up in about any configuration imaginable unless you are buying for some institution you ll skip the base and deal with the lx   which comes with the second sliding door   next   you ll scratch your head trying to figure out what the difference is between the lx and se models   all the same equipment is available on each   so sooner or later your salesman will have to breakdown and confess the only difference is the chrome trim which mars   imho   the se s grille and sides it looks like the chrome tape you can buy at pep boys   but evidently some segment of s market research showed anything over gs has to have chrome   next you ll wonder why anybody in their right mind would pop for a top of the line sel   with the garish two tone paint and three spoke wheels which actually look less luxurious than the down market windstar alloys   the sel also harbors s hyped but likely high nuisance factor rear sensor array   which is supposed to tell you when you are about to back into something but i bet sounds every time a cat swooshes past if this sounds like a big gold star for the lx   you get a gold star   it can be loaded up with nearly every available option   including a rear passenger stereo set up which has to be the envy of honda   traction control   quad seating   etc the drive train for all models is solid   if unspectacular   the hp v   moves the machine nicely at highway speeds   providing for effortless cruising and passing   but hey it is a mini van and not a dragster   even though the copious amounts of torque in the low end can come on quick   providing a less car like ride than the odyssey or say   the sienna   as dealers are getting rid of windstars pretty fast   and pocketing the several hundred dollars in factory holdback in the process   it shouldn t be too hard to come in with a price at or slightly above invoice   couple that with the aforementioned special financing and anyone in the market for a people mover needs to check it out br br  
1005,1,  i live in the netherlands europe and bought a new windstar sel   which comes   unfortunately   with a    ltr engine in the netherlands only   we   a family of    like to go on holidays on long trips like driving to spain or southern france   occasionally with a trailer caravan when i was in a hurry to get home i drove about   miles from spain to netherlands in a consecutive night and day   with hardly a pause under such circumstances you really value the windstar as a family limo    people are just sleeping and i am driving   with comfortable seating   music on a headphone    fan to keep you awake   and the small inside rearview mirror to watch over your family   in the meantime dragging a fully loaded caravan mobilehome through the rolling hills i have driven mercedes   volvo   audi   buick and other good cars   but like this one most cause driving it doesn t tire you the only thing i don t like is that models exist with a bigger engine and i don t have it   even at a gasoline price of   dollar a gallon and that car probably costing as much as      over here if starts to export    ltr models to europe   that will probably be my next one   next year or so one other thing is the remote sensor   in european cities you don t have much parking space   but with this reverse sensor   you can park it anywhere with great pleasure and people watching and admiring you for your craftmanship of course this car also had minor drawbacks sofar   like electric side doors not closing without some help every once in a year and plastic details just falling of but hey nothing is perfect and a isn t a with some less significant loose parts easy to be clicked back   auto detroit is french for selfdestruct also the seat configuration is hard to change   with some european cars like renault or opel you need only to point to a seat to remove but in windstar it is real work one more important positive part   my wife doesn t like to drive big cars in general   but really loves this one  
1006,1,  wehn my parents were looking for a new car they were especially interested in a van   only problem was that they did nt know which one   whether it be a quest   sienna   caravan   or windstar   first   we were interested in the sienna but they were very hard to find available and they are a heck of a lot of money   then we came across the windstar   what a van   it was very spacious and we got it at a great deal   in the front seat there is an unbelievable amount of leg room   and don t worry about the back seats plenty of room for any sized person   i recommened to get bucket seats in the middle seating area   much more attractive and private like for the riders   the seating is very comfortable and the remote door feature is an ideal one for youngsters and elders   c mon think about it   you know how heavy a van door is   right   well all you have to do is press onw button and it is opened for you   i also recommend that you select the option of no middle console because the van is much more spacious without   and you really do nt need it because there is a big bucket type drawer on the fron console   the trunk of the van is also unbelievably huge   i couldn t believe it when i saw it   so take my advice and go look at a windstar br br  
1007,1,  my wife and i own a   windstar that we bought in feb   and we have had no problems with it at all   we had a   and have leased for the last   years from for with only a couple of problems over the last   years with   different van s   when we did have a problem fixed it the first time is was in the shop   we would buy another one when this lease is up   the ride is great and is very comfortable   she really likes two side doors and with a set of twins and two older kids its easy to get in and out   we have taken several trips and has a lot of room br br  
1008,1,  i have a windstar lx    it is so comfortable   quiet and spacious   the redesign of this car was a complete success   it is larger with more available amenities and the option of a much more powerful engine   l v   the addition of a second sliding door makes the all new windstar a very good choice in your minivan   in the van i felt very safe knowing that is got quadrouple five star safety ratings very high marks it is the most comfortable   quiet and spacious minivan i have ever been in   and i was only in the lx model   it is priced right at about     to start and boy   it is well worth it i had an early nineties sedan that was much less manuverable than this van and it is three times the size br br  
1009,1,  i purchased my new windstar in august of   from bankston in frisco   texas   i would recommend this vehicle to my best friend   continues to put out the highest quality cars and trucks on the road   the windstars safety record speaks for itself   my insurance went down    a month when i purchased it   trading in my   van   my insurance agent was as happy as can be because the van comes factory equipped with a passive anti theft system   the ride is great   there is lots of room for my family and the gear that comes with two kids lots   if i had to do it all over again i would buy the exact same vehicle   times out of   if you are in the market for a van that the whole family will love   has the van for you   i have the windstar lx which is the middle of the line as far as accessories go and highly recommend it   the gas mileage is great for this big of a vehicle also   go buy one and you will love it too br br  
1010,1,  when we bought this van we had an aerostar for almost   years and loved it   it was very reliable and lots of fun to drive   it was also one of the safest vehicles on the road at the time last year     we bought the new model windstar   it was like a dream car   it is so pretty and rides really well   it sits all five of us comfortable and if there are a couple extra people with us they are fine also my father in law mentioned it rides like a caddy and it does   handles well and everything the gas mileage is good and it has taken very little to maintain it it has the highest safety ratings of all cars and this was a huge selling point for us   comfortable and safe   both my husband and i were in an awful accident in italy and don t want to take any chances again   well   now what i don t like is this   a   it has an engine knock that has been checked over and the dealer said that there isn t a knock   it must be the cheap gas   well we upgraded to a name brand and the knock is worse we also have been having problems with the transmission slipping   again we were told they couldn t duplicate the problem   this isn t as bad as it was but is still there   the engine knock is bad from time to time   was so bad the other day that it was hard to accelerate we are leasing and in   years our lease will be up and we will have to decide whether to buy this van or go on to another vehicle   if the problems are not fixed   you know where we are going   to another dealer br br  
1011,1,  if they did   they probably wouldn t be millionaires   no one in their right mind should have to pay    to    above msrp   like some dealers are charging for the   odyssey   in fact i looked at a used   odyssey in my area with k that was     so i purchased a very clean used   windstar se with k for     my second child will be here in a couple of months so i reluctantly had to make the big break from a car to a minivan would i have liked a honda odyssey or mazda mpv   yes could i have afforded a honda odyssey or mazda mpv   yes do i want to afford a honda odyssey or mazda mpv   no it was a simple question of value   getting something that works for not much money   let s face it   the majority of post   s vehicles are all much more reliable than they used to be     chrysler   gm   etc   a hundred thousand miles is nothing these days   k is a more realistic goal now   you don t need a honda or toyota to achieve that anymore furthermore i ve owned three hondas   two accords and one civic   they are not without their   glitches   and regular maintenance costs   mufflers   brakes   any other parts you may need   are roughly twice the price of parts for domestic vehicles   the newer hondas and toyotas may be made in usa   but usually the parts are made overseas and are subject to import tariffs   also a trademark of all my hondas was a hard   uncomfortable seat   and a harsh ride   that would be   a good feel of the road   and   stiff handling   to the honda fans   i drive    miles frequently with maybe one stop for gas   it became almost unbearable with a honda seat   sometimes i would be saddle sore the next day   seats may seem like small things to consider   but your hiney has a major interaction with your vehicle most models of the windstar have the features you most need   as do most of the minivans out there that aren t the absolute base model   it has comfortable seats   a comfortable   quiet ride   and most of all it is a good value   the thing is going to run for a long time   and i didn t have to break the bank to get one   not only can i haul my kids with the windstar   i have money left over to put a little away for their college fund if it needs a few repairs   so be it   the extra   grand i would ve had to spend on a similarly used honda will go a long way to any would be repairs  
1012,1,  as a former employee of   i found the aspire as a wonderfully refreshing replacement to the festiva   my first festiva went about    miles before the rings came unseated   and blew the oil out the aspire engineers have cured this problem   and i have the only gt aspire that i know of   i was with for   years   and can do just about anything that can be done to a car   mechanically speaking the aspire has the   hp festiva engine   otherwise known as a mazda   cosmo engine   and is set up to run on fuel that is subgrade to us unleaded   i decided to try an old trick of boring out the throttle body to increase the airflow through the engine   and got a little more than i asked for   the dyno gives me   hp with a decent highway mileage figure of   mpg   therefore i stuck some   quot gt quot   logos on the lower front fenders   and added the factory spoiler on the top of the rear deck the take off from redlights is a little bit better   but if you were looking for tire burners   get a   the aspire is a great little car   equivalent with the bug of the   s and   s   but with real seatbelts and airbags to boot   i have the intent to drive this car for a least    miles on the first engine and will periodically report the performance and cost of maintenance to   quot little red quot if you have any quirks to comment on   i m open for discussion i will try to share what i have learned from the parts books and mechanics   i have picked up a lot of info this way br br  
1013,1,   i bought another   used    crown vic with the insurance settlement after my first   a used    was totaled   the car was t boned at the front quarter panel by a driver on drugs   who plowed a    trans am at   mph through a stop sign   the air bags did deploy   see stormeyes org tornado nt jpg for details p though the car was knocked well off the roadway and totaled   my family and i escaped with only scrapes   scratches and a minor concussion   from the air bag impact   that was a high speed   side impact collision   folks   more than testament enough to the safety of this car   its use in police and taxi fleets was convincing enough already regarding the crown vic s durability   but now   as long as makes the crown vic with body on frame construction   i will not buy another make and model p the vehicle is a little over four years old as of this writing   and i have used it very heavily     miles of mainly highway driving in sometimes dreadful conditions   i am a storm chaser   and have equipped the car with a custom electronics rack that holds equipment very steady in such a stable   smooth riding vehicle    this car has been through severe wind   sand storms   large hail   day after day of   degree heat   subzero temperatures   deep mud   blizzards   and once   standing muddy water higher than the door bottoms   all with no mechanical breakdowns or major problems   it just passed its first tune up with flying colors    i can not imagine a more comfortable car in which to travel hundreds upon hundreds of miles per day   its top caliber suspension makes even notoriously rough oklahoma and south dakota back roads tolerable   and on a smooth interstate   it s hard to tell from feel alone that the car is moving at all   the crown vic has an suv s weight   but with a far lower center of gravity    making it amazingly stable in intense crosswind   it also is    mpg more fuel efficient than most medium to large suvs   unless one   needs and frequently uses   wd   who does   really   a used   late model crown vic should be given strong consideration as a primary family car p there is no more spacious trunk in the world of sedans   my friend   jokingly   suggested i could stuff six bodies in there with room to spare   seriously   i have a gall s police trunk organizer in the bottom   and there still is room for a long vacation s worth of luggage for a family of four plus groceries   although towing   officially   is passe   i pull a   ft bass tracker with no problems    there are some minor problems which i can tolerate for the sake of room and safety   the lx models   which i have had   could use more power   my car just can not accelerate up hills very well   fortunately there is an option here that doesn t involve expensive retrofitting   used car buyers should consider crown vic interceptors equipped with the police package   dual exhaust   for best results   also   my paint on the doors and front panels began to chip and peel in small spots at around    miles   revealing the white primer beneath   maybe that is related to the extreme conditions i have driven it through   but a truly well done paint job should endure far worse for far longer  
1014,1,  for those of you who were born after the s   or were not old enough to drive then   you missed something special   that was the experience of owning and driving one of detroit s huge old style luxury cars   though each manufacturer had its own fleet of flagships   all of those cars had one thing in common   luxury   and it was luxury that you just can t find today in any american car   because nothing else is like owning the sheer mass of a s american luxury car   the   ltd was a fine example of this departed breed   mine was a two door coupe with a landau top   despite the car s huge dimensions   the styling gave it almost a rakish appearance   being manufactured nearly   years ago   natural resources weren t in such scarce supply   either   thus the rich appearance of the chrome grill and bumpers   i find these vastly preferable to the plastic creations of today   mass was another thing this car has in abundance   the two door model weighed over    pounds   besides being almost completely invulnerable in a collision with another car   its huge cast iron v   made it nearly impervious to overheating in the summer   in fact   there were several times during my ownership that the radiator failed completely   yet i drove for miles without knowing the cooling system had broken down   simply because the car didn t overheat   ride quality was fantastic   nothing upset this car s poise   not bumps   railroad tracks   potholes   or debris   driving on the expressway at speed was like floating in complete isolation of the road   the interior was dead quiet   no wind or road noise   no rattles   squeaks   groans   or vibration   that only enhanced listening to the stereo   you didn t have to turn it up to overpower road noise to the point that the sound was distorted   whatever your pleasure   be it hard rock or string symphony   you could relax and listen to it at a comfortable sound level   interior room simply has no comparison in a modern american car   unless you go to the truck like suburban or its kin   vast   airy   and expansive   six adults sit with room to spare   the old style bench seats give you every possible square inch of seating area   likewise   the trunk is huge   easily swallowing a dozen or more bags of groceries   plus two spare tires   or enough luggage for a whole family   naturally   a car this old has its quirks   though they weren t seen that way when it was built   because it had the technology of its day   and not the st century   the engine was nothing sophisticated   cast iron block   no computer parts or modules   and pre electronic ignition   tune ups   and engine maintenance in general   are much more frequent than on a modern car   can you handle tune ups every    miles   and oil changes every     you ll also pay for replacement parts that no longer exist on modern cars   and for servicing they don t need   are you old enough to remember points and condensors   did you have to take your first car in to have its joints lubricated every    miles   if not   you re going to learn something   other aspects of the   ltd may also require some deep thought before you buy   the model i had boasted a   cubic inch v    it was a smooth running engine but only had moderate horsepower   about    cars were like that then   not like cars now which can give you   horsepower in a   cubic inch engine   the point   the car s power will do for everyday driving   including   emergency   passing   but you ll never burn any rubber   fuel costs to run this car may seem preposterous   but remember it was built when regular unleaded sold for   cents a gallon   suffice it to say that even with the smallest v    the    which was advertised as an   economy   engine then   you ll get about   miles per gallon city   and about   miles per gallon highway   and by the way   there s no fuel injection in this car   it s got a carburetor   still   there s nothing like driving a car like this   with a hood that s long enough to be the prow of a yacht   and a cabin that s big enough to be the command room of a battleship   such cars may never again be built by american industry   but this essay is in remembrance to the times in which they were  
1015,1,  we need to start with the model i own   the xlt with appearance package   several of my comments relate to features found in this model   the premium sound system   not the mach system   lacks low end bass   i fixed that with an add on sub   the good point being that the receiver is capable   it s just the amp that is lacking   the cargo area needs a net and some hooks to keep things in place   my biggest gripe is that the cargo area does not come with a cover and there is no aftermarket ones available   i fault for not adding two little pieces of plastic into the sides that would have allowed me to add one   this is coming from someone who has had their vehicle broken into because of what was visible in the cargo area   i got the    v and it gets about   mpg   my comment here is don t kid yourself   if you don t like paying for gas   then this is not the vehicle for you   my particular model has some unique    factory rims   something is not right because my wheels require balancing every   miles   my tire place tells me that the wheels are designed so that it is hard for balancing weights to stay on   this is not normal but i like the distinct look of the wheels   the awd system is not the best in the world producing noticeable slippage in snow   however   compensated for this by adding in the unusual option of allowing a wd mode   the wd mode is superb in the white stuff   this being my th awd wd vehicle   i prefer wd in snow   i refer you to the motto   transfers power from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip   the key point is that some slipping must be going on   when this is done well   see my epinion on the subaru outback   then you don t notice   in the expedition s case   it is not done well   but the wd mode compensates   the rd row seat   while improved over previous years   is still a pain in the butt to get in and out   it is heavy and bulky and i always strain my back dealing with it   yes   the manual says use two people   but i don t happen to have an official seat moving helper on staff at the moment   no normal feature of a car should require two people to use it   they tried to compensate by allowing the seat to be folded into a shelf or tilted up   both of these features are nothing more than marketing   the tilted up seat does not provide that much more room   the folded down shelf is useless because anything placed on the self slides right off   the new line of gm full size suvs seems to have dealt properly with this feature by allowing two separate seats   i tend to keep my seat removed and only put it back in when i have a lot of people to move   the vehicle definitely looks cooler with it out   now on to the many   many good points design room   room   room   i am     and no part of this vehicle comes even close to any part of me   shoulders   head   etc   good use of room   in checking out the wildly popular line of chrysler minivans   i found roomy vehicles   but a lot of wasted room   not so with the expedition   the console is fantastic   the cup holders large   and enough little storage areas to please a pack rat   i would ask for more storage in the cargo area though   if you ve done your research   you know that there is   feet between the wheel wells allowing for sheets of building materials   everything seems to be solid   no thin plastic parts   check out the console on a blazer for an example of cheap plastic parts   the steering wheel is large and cushioned and feels good in your hands   i really like the cd changer being accessible in the center console yet still having plenty of room left for stuff   try that with a smaller car   the controls are standard    rotary dials for climate   cruise control on the steering wheel   and minimal usage of steering wheel stalks   this being my third   i like my controls predictable   so i am very happy with the interior ergonomics the rear cargo area is cavernous and the pull down handle on the rear door is nice   the step up bumper allows easy access should you need to actually get in the cargo area the appearance package provides step bars instead of running boards   being tall   i don t like any step up features at all   considering them to be a wuss feature   however   the women in my life all consider this to the best feature of the truck   go figure   personally   i have to be careful or they get my pant legs dirty   there are grab handles for all   outboard passengers   mechanicals the ride and power is comparable to other suvs   remember i have the     in test drives i found the    to be underpowered   which is not true for the f pickup   one interesting note is that there seems to be so much power and low end torque that extra weight in the car seems to have little effect   i have had   lbs of passengers and could not tell from the way the vehicle handled and accelerated   the handling is great for something so large and the ride is exceptionally smooth for what is essentially a dressed up pickup   the anti lock brakes are better than the average   it comes with massive   wheel disks and does a good job stopping quick    the electronic awd wd works perfectly and is easy to use and understand although it is a little close to the ventilation knob   both in distance and shape   while i feel that this vehicle is tough enough to take off road   see my subaru outback epinion   i found the suspension to be a little spongy for off roading   when combined with the tremendous weight of this thing   i suggest keeping it on the pavement   in all fairness i have taken some roadway dips at higher speeds and never actually bottomed out   this might all be a perception thing on my part   seating the front seats are comfortable for longer drives   the second row seat allow   adults to sit without touching one another or the seat backs in front of them   the rd row seat is good for smaller people   i have had kids back there and they actually enjoy it   kind of like riding in the back of the station wagon when you were a kid in   months of ownership i have not had a single problem   the quality of this vehicle is truly first rate all in all this is one fantastic vehicle and i will probably buy another one in a few years  
1016,1,  i personally never owned or liked fords until my husband and i went shopping for vehicles   i was a gmc kind of gal and was really looking more at the gmc suburbans   my husband is a fanatic and has owned fords all his life   i didn t like his f   because of the leather seats and even though it was a   door   it was too small for us and his   kids   on this trip we went into a dealership and i was looking around while he arranged some maintenance for his pick up   i actually liked the look of the expedition   and was asked if i would like to test drive it   i said   quot sure quot   knowing my heart was set on a suburban   i love the way the expedition handles and the comfort level while driving   it was perfect and it opened my eyes   it handles and rides like a car   the seating is more comfortable than any suv we had previously driven and the adjustable pedals are a blessing   the back seats are even comfortable   the third row seats are fine as long as you don t try to put a    tall person back there   a teenager or two would fit back there comfortably   the only thing i don t like about this suv is the small amount of space behind the rd row seats   i guess that is why there is a luggage rack on top   we opted for the   wheel drive model as we live in arizona and don t venture much in snow   that is where the posi trac rear end comes in handy   it senses slipping and the posi trac kicks in   hubby really liked that feature and was glad to have had it while going up through the colorado mountains   i think this is the perfect car for families wanting to travel in comfort or for people wanting to start a family sometime soon   the automatic locking doors are perfect for keeping small children in tow while trying to remove groceries and such   this feature also keeps the curious kids from accidently opening the door while the vehicle is moving   an excellent choice in my book   lots of other features and goodies are available but my advice would be to test drive one and fall in live with it on your own br br  
1017,1,  in november of    my wife decided that she was interested in an suv and wanted to trade in our   ram   i had bought a   jeep wrangler for myself earlier in the year   so who was i to argue we went to all of the differant dealers in the area and checked out the durango   the jeep grand cherakee   blazer   gmc jimmy and tahoe   we then went to the dealer to see an explorer before we went back to make a deal on the duango   while walking across the lot to the explorers my wife spotted the expeditions   she immediatly locked on to a gold xlt and the durango was forgotten   a test drive cinched the deal since then we have taken a   and a   mile trip experiencing all types of weather each time   the expedition is a dream to drive   handles well and the gas mileage is reasonable   we get about   mpg in the city and about   on the highway   i have owned a good many vehicles in my time including a new cadillac sedan deville and this is my all time pick for comfort   safety is another factor as you sit nice and high and the expedition has a nice heavy secure feel   we have the small v and power is not lacking when we fold up the third seat we have all of the room we need and if we remove the third seat and fold the second seat the space approximates that of a pickup   long objects like lumber fit on the roof rack we have added tinted window vents   about     tinted front windows   about     and a k amp n air filter   about     when backing the vehicle seems longer than it is and the rear window being up so high makes it appear that vehicles and objects behind you are closer than they are one special luxury that we enjoy is the power operated adjustable gas and brake pedal   my wife is    quot   and runs the pedals all the way up and i like to have the lowest pedal setting   a touch of a button is all it takes   the only item i wish that it had was the memory settings for the seat adjustments but we can live without them all in all has a winner with the expedition   the comfort of a luxury car while giving more room for passengers and cargo   i had doubts at first about getting rid of our pickup because it was so handy   but no more   i am sold on the expedition   we looked at the excursion while we were at the dealer but it was just too big for us try one on for size and i ll bet you will be the next buyer br br  
1018,1,  when i see a expedition on the street   i decide for buy it   because it was excellent   it is better than lincoln navigator and durango   because it is more powerfull than durango   cheap than navigator and has same luxury whic i buy a eddie bauer x fully loaded   you can drive it ar snowy   rainy days without dangerous   it is an excellent car   more roomy than durango and strong than navigator engine   v the current v gives out hp   i feel more   which are adequate numbers for adequate engine performance   we could feel the power draining a bit when we loaded the truck with people   however   still   the shifts are smooth and the power curve is evenly proportioned throughout acceleration   my main gripe with the engine is the sub par fuel economy   even for an suv   the expedition especially wd models   i hear   seemed excellent   the rather not small gasoline tank is not to blame for frequent fill ups   i would not recommend the     hp   cylinder that is also offered   manual transmissions are not available for either engine selection   although automatics are far more popular the expedition uses an on demand   wheel drive system and can be shifted from   wheel drive into   wheel drive while the vehicle is in motion   maximum towing capacity is   lbs br br  
1019,1,  we purchased the expedition xlt sport edition in jan   upgraded engine   cloth seats   upgraded running boards    disc cd player we have   kids    of which are still in some form of carseat booster seat   so   when we went shopping for a larger vehicle   one major requirement was being able to seat   carseats alongside one another   without any complications   in many cars   vans   and even some suvs   it s almost impossible to do that without having one carseat pushed up against the other to the point where the seats don t sit evenly   amazingly enough   we were able to put all   carseats in without any trouble at all the other problem we faced was my husband    his height   he s     that leaves a lot of cars out of the running because he s either scrunched up in the driver s seat   with his knees hitting the steering wheel   or his head is hitting the interior ceiling personally   i favored the design of the durango   but alas   my husband s head not only hit the ceiling   but if it had had a sunroof   his head would ve been out of the car after looking at the fords   i really wanted the excursion because of the extra storage space   but my husband was concerned about the gas mileage   moot point in the end because he works from home   therefore   no commute   we only spend about    a month on gas   price being about     gal in n   calif   because we only drive places a couple times a week as a family we solved the space issue in the expedition by folding down the two middle row seats   leaving the rd seat behind the front passenger seat up   and being used   then placing the other   kids in the back row   this freed up a bit more usable area for groceries or the stroller overall   i ve been happy with it i like the fact that the driver s seat is adjustable   as are the brakes   because i m only     it s been an easy vehicle to drive   unlike some of the minivans i ve owned before   ie   grand caravan    the pontiac transport   and it actually doesn t drive like a large vehicle my only real complaint is the lack of storage if you are putting more than   people into this car   i still think that once we re ready to trade this vehicle in   i m going to push for the excursion or possibly a suburban  
1020,1,  my family has been a family for the past   years if not longer   my husband and i have just purchased a   expedition earlier this month   we are expanding our family and needed a bigger vehicle to fit our family and our belongings   the third seat in the back is a great idea it can be removed if we need the space or it can be used for extra passengers   it is so much more convenient then a compact car   we went from a stratus to the expedition and in the car we could not have anyone ride with use so if we want to go some where with some one we would have to take at least two cars and that got pathetic   my mother has owned a expedition for   years now so we were not really getting into something new   she has had no problems with her expedition and we hope that we will have no problems either   this is a great car   truck   suv   what ever you want to call it   it is comfortable to drive and easy to ride in so now i ca nt wait until our next long road trip br br  
1021,1,  this review comes about mostly as a rebuttal to my wife who insists on comparing her car   a   honda civic dx   to mine    escort gt let us take a look at the individual parts and then the gestalt whole   shall we engine    possibly the strongest reason for buying the car   mazda s   l dohc pushes out   hp   and it does so pretty effortlessly   willing to rev   the secret formula is that the engine feels so strong because the car is so darn light   when new   the published    times on this car were in the high s   low   second region   that was faster than many cars twice its size   mostly because they were twice its size   this allowed me to surprise many taurus   olds cutlass and chevy lumina owners at stoplights   the only problem i have is that the car is geared relatively low for quick acceleration   and so cruising at mph it is turning between a fairly noisy    rpm   the upside to this is if you mash the pedal even at mph   the engine is right in the sweet spot of the torque curve and surges forward nicely handling    again   excellent in a car so priced   the car feels light and tossable in corners   yet tracks straight at speed   stiff spring and shock rates coupled with wide tires make this thing hang on tenaciously in turns   there is one large beware   however   lift throttle induced oversteer can be extreme when cornering hard   i personally enjoy it because i can flick the tail out easily when i m in the mood   but to the novice or inattentive   watch out   my wife was driving with me in the rain about   weeks after i bought my baby   and she let off the gas mid turn on a wide sweeper and the tail came right around   sending us grinding across a low stone wall   taking out the entire undercarriage   almost   k damage   the dealership did a bang up job of putting it back together and it has tracked straight as an arrow ever since ride    the stiffness that makes for such good handling translates into so so ride comfort   a little tire noise and bounciness over bumps is tolerable the lightness comes at the expense of not having much sound deadening insulation   i do have to say i have gone through   sets of brake pads   but i drive pretty hard   and this may be normal wear for k miles   i also seem to go through tires pretty fast   which may also have to do with my relatively aggressive style   sidenote   oem tire size is   r   and the only tire made in that size is the oem goodyear eagle gt    which are expensive    apiece   my solution after k miles was to switch up safely to    s which are available in more and cheaper brands transmission    shifts just fine   not crisp but not sloppy   even after    miles   never been replaced   original clutch   effort is light   the only thing i wish i had was a quick little wrist shifting car like a miata or toyota mr   the throw on the gt is not nearly as long as on my old   exp   but it s not as short as i d like exterior    my wife will argue this to death with me   but i still think it looks sporty   i first fell for this car in it s    iris package trim   with the alloy wheels that matched the car s paint color   i ended up with the silver alloy wheels   and i think they look even better   it s no   vette   but it still looks better than a tercel or corolla   or even my wife s civic anyday interior    ok   this is not a luxury car by any stretch of the imagination   first of all   the gt comes with virtually nothing power   no power windows   locks   seats   airbags   etc   the logic behind this is that all of those things add weight   which would slow the car down   the interior is sparse   the cupholders good   dash has usable space   plastic is hard   not great but not tacky either   the controls are intuitive and well placed   none have ever broken on me   the stereo is good   though again its speakers are odd sizes that are only slightly more difficult to replace with aftermarket than usual   the a c is ice cold   still a good freon system   not the lukewarm ra system my wife has in hers   the seats are comfortable for me   but in all honesty not the greatest for long hauls   but the side bolstering is good and adjustments are easy   with a lot of room if you re tall and up closeness if you re short   the one feature that i am continually amazed at is the amount of cargo space i have if i fold the rear seats and load from the hatchback   this car is cavernous   i haul to the dump   carry lumber   have moved twice with it   it just has a ton of room for such a small car reliability maintenance    so far   this is where my baby has shined   my wife talks on and on about her civic s superior quality   but here is a stone cold fact   my car has virtually no repair history to speak of   no kidding   and this car has    miles on it   replaced the timing belt at k   the   degree elbow off the exhaust manifold finally rusted through   months ago   i replaced it   but the all stainless pipes from the flex pipe back is all original   i mentioned tires and brakes going quickly due to my driving habits   no tranny clutch problems   a little tiny bit of oil leakage finally the last few months   what do you expect after almost k    all original hoses   belts   brake lines   master cylinder   suspension   cables   etc   the a c compressor just went on me this week   july    and will need replacing   i put new plug wires on it   yrs ago   and i think i had one small leak   quickly sealed   around the rear window when i first got it   one small niggling problem   i feel like i have replaced a lot of headlights and foglights   but what is that     or so for a bulb   all in all   for    miles i have had nothing but trouble free driving pleasure from this car   and isn t that what it s all about overall   well   tallying it up   it looks like the average score for my little pocket rocket is solid     even though she s a   in my heart   for the money   some of the cheapest fun you can have on the road   good looks   great performance   solid reliability   tough to beat in its class   what a package br br  
1022,1,  this is a nice little car but when i say little i mean it   you could not fit four good sized guys in this cars it would come apart at the seems   the only other downfall is that is has aluminum heads on it and if you overheat the car once you will most likely crack the heads   but other then that it is not a bad little car if you are looking for a beater to get back and forth to work   and they get great gas mileage about   miles to the gallon   i would recommend this car to anyone that is looking of cheap transportation     
1023,1,  i discovered yesterday that it would be cheaper for me to rent a car than it would be to take a taxi or shuttle to get home so   i called hertz and said   quot i want the cheapest car i can get quot they set me up in a champagne colored escort   a rather nice looking vehicle   for day to day use   i like larger cars   like my intrepid   but i simply needed to get from point a to point b   and then briefly to point c to drop the car off   so i wanted something with four wheels and an engine if hertz s cheapest car is the escort   anyone who pays for an upgrade is just throwing away money in a hurry   we threw all the suitcases in the back seat of the car   it looked like it had decent legroom   i got into the car and immediately noticed how it different from other rentals i ve had   several    and    cavaliers and a   escort    disclaimer   i ve also rented a   jeep wrangler   but these are for two different types of uses the   escort looks and feels nice inside   the steering wheel is pretty thick   my s is a little thicker   but it s still formidable   the window and lock controls are firm and sturdy   the gear shifter well made and sturdy in your hand    the other rentals felt plasticky with snap together pieces that didn t always fit well all of the climate and radio controls are easily reachable by both the driver and passenger   the radio sounds clear and the air conditioner blasts cold air pretty well   what s really cool is that the radio displays the time   and   the radio station at the same time   no having to push buttons back and forth   the seats are comfortable and you have a good view of the road   the rear columns are thin   meaning less blind spots   the windows go up and down quickly and quietly    but   you probably want to know   how does it drive b this is where the   escort impressed me the most   the car handles very well   its steering is crisp and its acceleration is amazing   i m used to a much heavier car and i was incredibly surprised at how quickly this car accelerated   it cruised well at   and is a very quiet car   inside   the engine noise is very muted   it also breaks quickly if i were still in college and had had a chance to drive this car   i would have wanted one br br  
1024,1,  my best friend had just recently purchased a zx   when i found out that he had traded his camaro for this small gas saver i was greatly disappointed in him   but my opinion changed when he was telling me about how little it cost him and how great it was on gas i was starting to get interested   he invited me for a ride in his new car and i accepted   as soon as i sat in the comfortable seat i fell in love   for a small car it rode like it was at least     with a   cylinder under the hood   but that was just the beginning   we drove for about a half an hour and i was surprised when he asked me if i wanted to drive it   i accepted in an instant   i got behind the wheel   and off we were   the zx is such a blast to drive   and the handling is outstanding   maneuvering through traffic is no problem with this peppy little four banger   what i like the most about this car is its ability to get up to speed quickly   its comfortable and sporty interior   and its dual airbags make this a safe   dependable   low maintenence car for anyone who wants to save money and have something sporty at the same time   i highly recommend going to the dealer and at least taking one of these for a test drive     
1025,1,  i feel that you can not go wrong buying a escort   whether your buying it brand new or used my husband and i bought an    wagon two years ago   it had    miles on it when we got it   and now has about    miles on it   we ve taken it on several road trips   stuffed several people in it   and loaded it down the groceries   we also had an awesome pioneer system in it   that should have   in all reality should have shook the car apart   a couple of time we with a month or so over on oil changes   and never had a problem with it   eight months ago we discovered that the head gasket was blown   we decided to drive it until it blew up   well guess what   it is still running like a champ   we also purchased an    escort about six months ago   to our surprise it had the original   factory oil filter   tran   filter   spark plugs   and wires   the same parts for twelve years   i have never heard of any other car running on the original parts   has definitely won us over   we don t plan on purchasing another vehicle any time soon   but if we where to buy one   it most certainly will be a escort   
1026,1,  i bought my escort zx in november     it was the first new car that i ever bought   i d previously purchased used cars   i didn t do a good job comparison shopping   and ended up paying more for it than i should have p the car is great   i love the way it runs   the way it looks   and the way it sounds   i get about   miles per gallon   and that s so important with today s gas prices p the only drawback that i ve found with this car is the price of the tires   decided to use a certain size tire on these cars   and goodyear is the only manufacturer of this particular size   there is no other size that fits on the rims    i went to   different tire dealers looking for cheaper tires   the lowest i found was     per tire    plus installation p since   of my tires were bad   and the other two had a lot of wear   i replaced all   tires   these    tires lasted only a few months    i went to another tire dealer who told me it may be possible to get different rims   he looked in a junkyard for me and found   rims for     yes   used   but i was able to then get   normal   sized tires at only    each    the big drawback of all this is now i have   ugly   rims   black with no chrome   on my car that i should now paint p all in all   i do love my car  
1027,1,  my wife and i are on our second   we leased our first one two and a half years ago   we ve found that the is tough and reliable   not a thing has gone wrong with either that we ve owned   the that we currently have is an extended cab model   which i highly recommend   the space that you get behind you seat is worth the expense   the jump seats come in handy when taking on unexpected riders   we also got the four door option   which is also very convenient   my only complaint with my   is that i wish i had gotten a bigger engine   as my new one is under powered   leasing frightens a lot of consumers   we have found that there is nothing to be afraid about it   the first that we leased went over the given mileage by twenty thousand miles   but the dealership that we went to forgave the mileage when we got our new one the is a very good vehicle and i recommend it to anyone br br  
1028,1,  i had been driving an   bronco selected by my husband who wanted a big vehicle   which was slowly rusting away over the last few years and beginning to have some mechanical woes   i started out shopping for a used small truck with automatic transmission   i didn t particularly want a x   although had gotten out of some situations with the bronco s   wheel capabilities   i looked on line   in classifieds and at local car dealers   it was very difficult to find anything to meet my needs   most trucks were standard transmission   and had high mileage finally one of the dealers called   they had just gotten in a new   xl which met my needs   it also had a   cylinder engine   which was strongly recommended over a   cylinder by my male relatives and trusted mechanic i m really glad i spent the extra money and brought this truck   it is easy to drive   and i feel secure in it   it s isn t as high off the road as the bronco was   but enough height to feel i have adequate vision   the doesn t have too much room in the interior   my son   who is quite a bit taller   feels that his left arm is cramped against the door   i recently added a cap   and feel this makes the truck feel more solid now   for example   when i crossed train tracks the rear of truck would bounce   now it holds the road better   i also added a floor mat and that seems to have made it a quieter ride   i think the a c and heater are really great and do their jobs well   the radio has good quality sound i have a cassette player which i like   as i often listen to speakers on tape i would recommend this truck to someone who wants a vehicle for every day use   i think it would be a uncomfortable for a large person   and a person who depended on a truck for business would probably want a long bed   but for my needs   it is super br br  
1029,1,  my husband has always wanted a new truck and last year we went searching for a new vehicle   we waited until the end of the year clearance time and we found it   we got in on a red carpet lease at     interest   for real   this was a terrific deal and the saleswoman and entire staff were easy to deal with and it is very fast getting regular maintenance appointments with our local dealership we have the extended cab   flared sides cylinder and it gets excellent gas mileage   in fact   it does about the same as my little car and we can haul with this baby   we put a hitch on it and took it to the home improvement store with our trailer on the back and it rode so smoothly you would never know that you had a trailer in tow   we are used to towing behind a suburban   so that is saying a lot   the only thing i would change is that i would have more room in the extended part for seating   but i know that is really not what the truck was designed for   driving this vehicle is as smooth as driving a car   it handles terrific and the paint job just gleams in the sun after being actually almost two years old   we have had no problems with this truck and if we don t buy it at the end of the lease we will jump into another one   no question in my mind about that this is not a large family vehicle for certain   you can easily allow two children to safely ride in the jump seats   but they would have to be small children and i would not suggest a long trip because they would not be comfortable   but anyone who wants a truck for the smaller hauling jobs   or trailer towing   this is perfect   this is also great to go shopping with   put your large purchases easily in the body of the truck and you still have plenty of room for your groceries behind the seat   i do it all the time br br  
1030,1,  i had a   up until   months ago   i finally decided to look for something newer   i also have a bronco   so i was already set on a product   after going from lot to lot   town to town   i finally found just what i was looking for the truck i bought is a   xlt x supercab   quadcab   it has the    engine as i don t need the    which has a few more hp and less mpg i have no problem pulling a boat with this truck   i have the automatic   with overdrive transmission my hardest decision was whether to get the flarebed or straightbed   i went with the flarebed   it looks so much better this is a very sporty truck that lacks no power   it is a very comfortable ride with minimal windnoise i have had it in the mud and snow on several occasions   no problem   i have the   off road package   wheel drive with the skid plates on the transmission   it came equipped with driver airbag and passenger airbag   the passenger airbag can be disengaged   good feature   my truck is loaded with the exception of the power package   which consists of power doors locks and mirrors   i am very satisfied with this purchase   the sound system is awesome the was the best small truck i test drove   and had the best overall looks   i know   performance comes first   and it performs   trust me on this i love the way this truck handles   on and off road the only setback is the bed   inside to inside   is not   quot   wide i understand that we are all different and have different needs   so   if you are looking for a truck   take a look at the   this is my first new auto purchase   as i have always preferred buying used br br  
1031,1,  we bought the   for our daughter   she was headed off to college and needed reliable   safe   and affordable transportation   we haven t had one misgiving since purchasing it over a year ago my husband liked the idea of a vehicle with a full body frame   i like the idea of the dual airbags   the   cylinder engine doesn t use up excessive amounts of gasoline   making it a vehicle she can afford to drive the cab is small   but that s okay with us   too   this ensures she won t have loads of passengers with her   we bought the basic model   which included only a cassette player   radio   but no air conditioning    hey   we were buying her a vehicle   what more could she ask for my husband likes the idea that with a   cylinder   she doesn t get a great deal of pick up when accelerating   i just like the idea that it starts every time she turns the ignition   whether in the heat of summer or sub zero winter temperatures the truck bed has come in handy   especially when she moved all of her belongings away to go to college we purchased the with s     financing   with a little homework we discovered that we actually saved money buying her a brand new   rather than the   we had first considered  
1032,1,  when i first saw this bright red   xlt sport with   quot aerodynamic quot   striping   i thought it would be the perfect vehicle for my teenage daughter   i d bought her a   mazda b cab plus   pickup three months earlier   and assumed this adorable truck would steal her heart and give me the stodgier four door mazda truck   she refused to give up the mazda and i realized this was the perfect truck for a   something mom who never had anything so cute   what s more   the    l engine allowed it to pull a horse trailer   with horse   i bought the truck used with   miles on it from a man who had won it at the local dealership   it had never been titled or registered and was covered with the stickers of the local radio station which had sponsored the contest    luckily   they came off easily   i must admit that the powerful   roaring    l engine has brought out the teenager in me and i sometimes just can t help leaving everyone behind when the traffic light turns green   when i drive more responsibly   i can get   mpg out of the truck   although    mpg is the norm   it was   mpg in the very beginning   but increased as the truck broke in   unfortunately   this truck has firestone wilderness ht tires and i ve already made firestone replace one for free when it was almost bald at    miles despite recommended rotations and balancing   they gave me a big talk about different qualities of rubber   but i know i ll be replacing all four tires within the year   after one year i ve had no problems whatsoever and have not even visited the dealer   i ve changed the oil myself and had the rotations balancing done at the local tire kingdom   i have another    miles warranty but hope i never meet the service department of the local dealership   the interior is comfortable but not plush   the seats are a mixture of a tweed like material with a little velour thrown in   very adequate   i wish i had an extended cab but i ve learned to simply take all the junk i ve accumulated out of the truck each weekend   i knew i never needed to keep that gallon of windshield washer fluid with me all the time   but now i know i can t   this is the first time i can honestly say i love my vehicle br br  
1033,1,  this past summer i bought my   extended cab off road truck   i am pleasantly surprized with it s options and handling ability   my truck is fully loaded with all the options and is manuel and i love it   it handles great on all the turns and since it is a v   i have plenty of power for all my needs   the x is great in the winter and whenever i am hauling or off roading   if you are looking for a truck that isn t huge but has all the power you would need   the is the way to go   the ride is quite smooth considering it is a pick up   the only downfall that i have found is that the seats in the extended cab area are tight   you surely would not want to make someone travel back there for long     
1034,1,  i have a   wedgewood blue ext cab    door   automatic   it has a v   engine and it s fully loaded   i love this truck   not only is it the best looking truck i have seen in a long time   it is so nice   i would rather be in it than anywhere else   the gas mileage could be a little better   but if you want better mileage i would recommend a standard v    which is what i had before this truck   this truck has great features like a switch to turn passenger side air bags off and on   some extended cabs come with   doors   which makes getting in and out alot easier   mine can run on ethanol fuel and everything else that you can think of   this truck is also safe   i was recently in an accident   the other car hit me pretty hard and my damage was minimal   this truck is built   quot tough quot this truck is worth every cent that i paid for it      there is a for every price range   and all of them are wonderful the only thing that i don t like about this truck is the color that i picked   it gets dusty where i live   and my truck is constantly dirty a is a great vehicle for anyone   but since it is so easy to handle on the road   it s a wonderful first car this isn t really a family truck   but what truck is   if you have long legs or a large build   you will not be comfortable in the back seat     
1035,1,  my t bird has been a great car so far   everyone who has driven it has commented on how smooth it drives and how well it handles the road   rain and snow are not a problem   this car is built for all weather conditions   not to mention   mine came with the climate control that allows you to control the temperature of the car   so it s really a joy to drive   no matter what it s like outside   the only problems i ve had have been that the vacuum hose disconnected itself somehow   but that caused minimal problems    mainly   it just made an annoying sound   i need new engine mounts right now   but i attribute that to the roads in this area    my husband just had all   replaced on his car i love the options on my car   and it s good for getting the baby car seat in and out   it s great for local driving or roadtrips   my sister has had to replace the engine and transmission on hers   but it s been driven rough   treat this car good   and it will be a joy  
1036,1,  i am a proud owner of a explorer   i received this car about   years ago   and would not trade it for the world   an explorer can fit tons of stuff in it   trust me i fill it to the brim everytime i go back to college   not just things   but you can fit several people in there and still have a comfy ride   in fact the explorer is so comfy   i can drive   hours without having to stop and stretch   the explorer has electric seats   which makes it perfect for any size person to drive   because it so easy to adjust gas goes a long way as well   granted it is expensive to fill up   but once you do you won t have to for a while an explorer is dependable and sturdy   over thanksgiving i was rear ended by a car that was rear ended by a mack truck and there was no damage done   rarely do i need to take my car in for anything other than an oil change   i know when this explorer dies   the next car i will get will be an explorer br br  
1037,1,  i bought my explorer in   when they weren t the   quot station wagon quot   of the   s   i have a dirt road    mile long with lots of ruts and bumps   i haul pot bellied pigs and my dog   straw   heavy food bags and drive on the lawn   my explorer has lasted with general maintenance and new tires   this vehicle is great for riding tough   i change the oil regularly and the air filter maybe once a year   this vehicle is not made just for good looks   this vehicle is for someone who wants to run their car   haul   and off road br br  
1038,1,  i bought my   explorer because i wanted a bigger vehicle to haul around all my and my brother s stuff   for hauling it s great   it even tows very well   i towed my brother s boat   miles with absolutely no problems   it handles great with no real problems   and putting it in   wheel drive is easy   just push a button   my biggest problem is that in the winter i m from iowa   this vehicle does not stop very well on snow or ice   unlike most vehicles that may slide slightly   my explorer is all over the road   you have to start stopping over a block before the stop sign   anyone is fair weather climate should have no problems with this vehicle   its great for hauling all of your things and towing your boats   etc   and it gets around great br br  
1039,1,  a few years ago we bought a explorer used at the dealership where it had originally been purchased   three years ago we traded it for a custom van   i miss my explorer so much the ride was comfortable   and the seats were so comfortable   throughout the time we had it   there were the regular maintenance needed   it did get to the point of needing the transmission replaced   the repair shop never told us it needed to be serviced   so when we had the transmission replaced we decided to trade it before it started needed more work even though we have a van now   it was easier to carry groceries or anything in the back of the explorer   i hope to buy another explorer or perhaps an expedition after the van is paid off br br  
1040,1,  i am overall very pleased with my taurus   i am a student and my budget was tight   accords of similar vintage cost roughly double   and up   of what i paid for this taurus   car was purchased with just under    on the odometer   car currently has just over    the price paid includes conditioning costs   new brake pads   new tires   good year regettas   new oil pan   new fuel   oil     air filters   thorough vacuuming   shampooing   and vinyl conditioning things done prior to purchase by previous owner   new struts    months   new exhaust    yr old   new hose    belts   all maintenance done   records included with car   all recalls taken care of   air conditioning switched to r a and refilled   new battery problems with car   surface rust on drivers door   fixed with friend the little things i like   self supporting hood with light   courtesy lights on front doors   drivers side dual sunvisors   allows you to put one to side and one to front   blue tinted   factory   reduced glare mirrors   secondary controls for radio   separate clock   bi level dash   vents include a positive off position   roof racks   console   powerful air conditioning   more powerful then our toyota   powerful heater   interior gas and tailgate release   hatch can be opened with just window or whole tailgate   large controls for power windows and power door lock   power window drivers lock out   dual air bags   abs standard   the   l moves the wagon better then our   l camry under a load   starts in   c and c weather   first try every try   large alternator and battery   ride soaks up bumps   barely feel speed bumps   storage compartment in rear floor   blue gauges the things i don t like   weak speakers   am fm cass not cd   foot actuated parking brake   seats dirty   spills from previous owner   one cupholder   small steel    wheels   headlights aren t as strong our windstars   rear turn signals are red   no fender mounted turn signals   common in n a   rear wiper doesn t have intermittent setting   front passenger window lazy   stories heard about the   l engine   space saver spare   no tachometer the ride quality the taurus is not as sporty as our camry   the taurus sounds busy when accelerating   however once up to speed the taurus is fine   dash shakes at about km h   the taurus seems more stable in winter driving conditions then the camry   brakes take a bit long to stop on black ice   the taurus has very light steering   power steering assist is a bit extreme   not much feedback through wheel   going over speed bumps is no problem   the taurus doesn t like taking corners at much above the posted speed limit   when taking corners in the wagon you have to be careful due to the long rear overhang   traction in the winter is adequate   i just worry about people slamming into me who don t have abs   has happened twice the exterior front marker lights are large   the car has clean lines but lacks styling and personality   rear taillamps are only adequate in size   turn signals aren t as noticable as our windstar    camry since they are not amber   lower body cladding   car seems lighter then the new taurus   windows are large   the curved rear window seems like it would cost a lot to replace   my body handles are easy to operate but are black and ugly   when you lift any of the four handles the interior lights turn on the interior the low dash gives good visibility all around   reminiscent of a honda   interior has that   old version of modern feel   to it   the front seats seem to be the same shape as the old camry   interior of my wagon only holds   people   not much lumbar support   seats are covered in a soft material    the material in the windstar is much plusher   overall i like the seat comfort more then our   camry   the taurus has more windnoise inside then the camry    although part has to due with the age of the car   cars have come a long way in comfort   interior plastics seem a bit too shiny   the interior plastics in the   windstar have a softer more luxurious feeling to them   there is a handy built in pen holder   all controls are easy to reach   radio has many small buttons   but that can be said about any din sized radio   handy storage compartment below radio   the ashtray   my coin holder   is illuminated   all switches on the door and dash are illuminated except for the controls on the steering wheel   wheel mounted cruise control is easier to operate then the stick type found on the camry   dashboard clock is a nice touch overall i am satisfied with my taurus   it has been no problems with only oil changes every km   so far the car is holding up very well  
1041,1,  after wreaking the other car we decided on a mid sized car   well we have had it for about   weeks and are really enjoying it   it seats   comfortably    in the front and   in the back   it has auto windows   with a window lock power door locks lots of foot space in the front and back and power steering   i am really enjoying the power steering   it turns corners so easy and smoothly the comfort level in the car is great and talk about trunk space   the trunk is huge you could probably fit a small calf in it i highly reccomend this car br br  
1042,1,  i bought my   taurus a few months ago and i m totally pleased   i purchased it mainly because for an older used car   it had very low mileage and was kept in great condition with   owner   i have to say the size of the car took a little while to get used to since i had only had compact size before   it drives smoothly and only had to make   repair since i purchased it   and that was something small   a hose   the mileage is fairly good for a bigger car   any used car should be looked at as that a used car   don t expect to have no problems   especially with a   year old car   however   in my case   i am extremely pleased with my purchase   i would suggest this car for people who have a medium sized family and don t want something too large     
1043,1,  i was looking for my first truck in   and after looking at all the makes   i settled on the   i chose the because of the consumer reports rec and the price   went to a dealer   in feb    that had leftover   models   first i test drove the regular cab but i just didn t fit as i m     and my knees were jammed into the steering wheel   then i tried the extended cab model and found it roomy   i bought the extended cab xlt wd    speed manual   with ac   cruise   power windows   remote entry   i have loved this truck since i m still driving this truck today with    miles on it   last week i just got a tune up for the first time for     i only had this truck repaired twice   once for a noisy wheel bearing for    and another time to weld a loose tail pipe for     that s it i find this truck very comfortable with the    split bench seat and the spacious cab   another feature i like is the    gallon fuel tank   i average mpg for mixed city highway driving so i can get at least   miles between fuelings   this is handy on long trips there is one minor problem that i m living with   the dome light stays on intermittently   when i park and lock the door   the light stays on so i pulled the bulbs out of the sockets so i don t drain my battery the ride is decent   but a little noisy   not too serious though   handling is decent   the   cyl has enough power to do the job but sometimes i wish i had some extra power to pass slower cars and for steep hills   it has    miles on it but i m not finished with it yet   i plan to keep it for another year at least    mile update   this truck is still going strong   no problems and made it through the winter without a hitch  
1044,1,  i know my limitations   my knowledge about automobiles is practical and every day   rather than research and engineering   i hate popping up the hood looking at the engine and i can t tell a cam from a ham   however   i m sure i ll be just as happy with my   taurus as i was with my first two   if you re looking for a mechanical   high tech   minded review of the taurus   stop right here   however   if you re interested on why i love my taurus   please read on i have always been happy with my taurus for three reasons   service and reliability   safety   and my wallet   i always have had a    mile lease on the taurus   with my first two   my only   quot major quot   expense in over    combined miles was a small   engine part   less than     i do follow the service manual for maintenance   relying on my friendly dealer in franklin   wisconsin   for repairs and support   with reasonable   competitive rates   the manual says take it in at    for this this and this   i take it in   this system works for me   i might save a dollar or two by going to a quick lube place for an oil change   but the peace of mind is worth going to the experts   plus   they keep an on line historical record of what maintenance has been done   has implemented a   quot personal safety package quot   for the   taurus   this includes   quot smart quot   air bags and deployment   side crash bars   and especially important   child safety seat anchors   if you ever lost a wrestling match with the back seat seat belt   trying to connect your kiddie seat   this offers ease of installation and added safety against shifting   front wheel drive is a must in the midwest   as even in may   a snow storm can hit and make driving dangerous   fwd   as technical as i can get   gives me the additional traction necessary for safer driving   the interior is very roomy for driving   plenty of head and leg room   the bucket seats are comfortable   and the console is easy to use   the trunk is more than adequate for your needs   all this allows you a pleasant driving experience relating to a safer drive as for the wallet factor   as i mentioned   little or no major repairs   just routine maintenance   my gas mileage has ranged from    mph to   mph   the power to reach top speed is there when necessary   freeway ramps   etc   the taurus is not a gas guzzler by any means the lease cost has always been competitive   with prices compared to other similar competing models and dealers   but why mess with a good thing   i have a winner   so stay with it   there s a reason why the taurus has been one of the top three selling models in america   all three of my tauruses   tauri   have been reliable   roomy   maintenance free   fairly stylish   and economical br br  
1045,1,  i bought a   taurus in    it was a one owner four door sedan   now i got to tell you   i do some serious driving   i drive back and forth to work   miles one way   this is a monday through friday driving experience and sometimes in not so nice weather because i live in minnesota   after racking up the miles on our taurus   my husband took it over because he only drives   mile to work each day   we love that so much that we went out and bought another one in    not just any taurus my friends   but another   taurus   it was also a one owner four door sedan with low miles   we have been very pleased with the fords   they run and run and run and run   i can depend on my   i know that when i get up in the morning it will start and when i drive home it will get me there   we make sure the cars get a regular   mile oil change and a six month check up with the old auto doc   maintenance costs have been low and repairs not much to speak of really   i figure that i will be looking for another car in about   years and i can tell you with confidence that it will be a taurus br br  
1046,1,  well   i have had my   taurus for about    miles now and would recommend it to anyone   the new design is much more eye appealing and the   hp duratec v adds plenty of punch for a mid sized sedan i looked at the intrepid   impala and the taurus   the intrepid was also great but i opted to steer clear of chrysler after being poorly treated by several chrysler dealers in my area    the product was very good though   the impala was also good but very pricey in comparison and i was concerned with the new model design ot being proven back to the taurus   i purchased the sel model which has almost everything except a moonroof   the engine is smooth and quiet   it shifts great and handles good for such a heavy car    i believe it s the heaviest car in it s class   the ride is smooth as silk   and shifts are hardly noticeable   it has great passing power in the    mph range abs works great as i found out right after i purchased it   the traction control is also great on slick roads   no snow test yet   however   both of these features are pretty noisy when the kick in   which is not unusual   the steering is also very responsive and again   it handles well for a heavy car   the one thing i could not figure out is why it does not have   wheel disc brakes   the rears are drums   come on get with the program i have been averaging about    mpg on a    mix of highway city driving   leather interior is nice   seats could use a little more side support   as for the interior   the design is very conservative compared to its competitors   very basic but functional controls   it s not as fancy as the intrepid or camry or any other of its competitors i also have the mach stereo system as the car on the lot i chose had it already installed   i would not recommend this system   i believe it was a    option   you could do much better at your local car stereo shop for the same price   it s not horrible but for the money there is better out there   the six disc changer is nice even though it s located in the trunk    should take a lesson from chrysler with the four disc in dash cd   much more convenient the taurus has a lot of great saftey features to go with its   star crash test rating   a big factor as i begin to start a family   front and side airbags   abs   fuel pump shut off to prevent fire   glow in the dark drunk release in case a child gets locked in the trunk i also have the keypad entry which is a cool feature although i have yet to use it   the heated mirrors will also prove to be useful when old man winter comes a knockin   automatic headlights are great although they do not go on automatically when you put on the windshield wipers   many states require you have your lights on when you use your wipers   the trunk is huge and the rear seats fold down the climate control is great and i have actually received several favorable comments on how fast the a c kicks in even on   degree days   have not used the heater yet   front and rear defoggers work very well if you can live with the plain interior this car should be at the top of your list   i believe the   model is back as the number one seller in its category this year but i m not positive br br  
1047,1,  well   not a whole lot   to be honest   i ve always driven trucks or suv s   and i was very reluctant about buying a car   you see   i m very short   this may sound unrelated   but i m just over   feet tall   and i never really liked the idea of being so close to the ground while i drove   whenever i was forced to drive a car when my car was in the shop or being used by someone else   i always felt like i was driving a go cart so   when i recently decided to trade in my explorer for something more fuel efficient   i figured i d stay with and go for a taurus   i purchased the taurus les   the luxury model   complete with leather interior and climate control   and i have to tell you   it s been absolutely incredible   apparently   has been working on the new design for the taurus for somewhere in the neighborhood of   years   although i m still closer to the ground than i d like   this model is much better than my mother s   taurus   the car rides much smoother than my explorer ever did   and it s much more fuel efficient   so   if there is anyone out there who s been hit as hard by the gas price hike and is nervous about buying a car   i d highly recommend this beautiful   economical car     
1048,1,  when we bought our   taurus we were in the market for a four door car   we were looking to trade in our   door chevy cavalier   we had just had our first baby and the   doors weren t helping getting the baby in and out of the car along with the other baby items   when we saw the taurus we loved it   it had leather seats   very roomy and power everything   but we have encountered problems with it   i don t know if it because the previous owner didn t take care of it or what   we have had to fix the transmission twice and replace the fuel pump once   overall it s costs us over five thousand dollars   but i still love this car   it s not a gas guzzler and it s not a huge vehicle   i would recommend any person with kids to buy this car   it has lots of trunk space as well   great if you have lots of things to take with you anywhere   the seats have lumbar support for those long travels   only thing i wish it had was heated leather seats   the cold seats in the morning aren t the best     
1049,1,  if you had told me when i was   that i would be driving a station wagon within   years i would probably have laughed myself into a stuper   well i was   when i decided that my kids and i had outgrown my little calais and we needed something with more room   so i started looking for the perfect vehicle and i found it very quickly   my sister and i had been out and about when we first saw the    taurus wagon sitting there on the lot saying   quot buy me   buy me quot   but i passed it off as   quot probably too expensive quot   well with out my knowing about it my sister went to the lot and asked about the car for me   it was a   taurus wagon with   some odd thousand miles on it   air conditioner   am fm radio tape   electric seats   locks and windows   rear defrost   and a few more nice little odds and ends   and the price was only     well i called my loan man and he said offer     they took it and i was the proud owner of a very roomy   and trustworthy vehicle   i had that vehicle for over a year when i decided to buy a new   used   vehicle   but the only reason i decided to get a new one was because my family was growing   i now had myself   my   kids   my fiance   and his daughter     amp   now one on the way   so we talked it over and decided to get a mini van   i still miss my wagon but i realize that for a family of   it is perfect but when you have a family of   that you need a bigger vehicle   if you are a family of   or more and looking for a nice   roomy vehicle the taurus is the perfect family vehicle but if there are more than of you it starts getting crowded br br  
1050,1,  i have been driving my   taurus for four months and have yet to have a single problem with the vehicle   i must admit that i did not buy or lease the car   my employer supplies me with a vehicle due to my line of work   our has been leasing the taurus since   and this is the best model year yet in the past we have had numerous problems with the front brakes and rotors   this problem area was most noticeable on the    and    models   my   taurus has   miles on it and has shown no signs of any brake deficiencies   in the past we have had repeated problems with warped rotors and premature brake pad wear   when the local dealer told me that the problem had been corrected for    i was skeptical   now   i am a believer additional improvements abound   my vehicle is the   dr ses model with the ohv vulcan v   for    the vulcan s horsepower has been increased slightly and its nvh reduced   i have found these improvements to be noticeable   if not significant   the freshly restyled exterior and interior are also   subjectively   improvements over the old model   the visibility through the rear window is much better due to   quot deep sixing quot   the oval rear window   the reduced blind spots are welcomed when trying to merge onto the freeways in southern california   the quality of the interior materials is substantially better than in the past   there is no longer an abundance of cheap plastic on the door panels   center console and other areas   the interior is now much more mainstream   the oval dashboard has given way to a more traditional one which is slightly more ergonomic in design   radio controls are grouped more logically and the auxilliary v power receptacle is now more accessible   my car is equipped with the full floor console with a floor mounted gear shift   in this configuration   has designed a unique and very versatile cup holder   it can be adjusted to handle a beverage container of almost any size   this is particularly nice for those of us who spend hours stuck in traffic my model came equipped with a standard power driver s side seat   this is a nice feature on a car in this price range as it offers me an infinite number of seating positions   the seat also has an adjustable lumbar support which is handy on longer trips   the only aspect of the old taurus seats that i liked better were their side bolsters   for    the seats do not have nearly the lateral support that they did in     this is a small quibble considering the other improvements interior details have also been attended to in the   redesign   effective map lights are well placed and easy to use   split sun visors allow the driver and passenger to simultaneously cover the front and side windows   this is especially nice on those days when the sun can not decide which window it wants to   quot attack quot   the visors also have nicely illuminated mirrors which were lacking from my last car i have been particularly impressed with the lower level of noise inside this year s model   while still not up to the accord or camry standard   it is still much improved from    and     the vulcan v still roars when under heavy acceleration   however   now the roar is more muted the overall ride for   is also enhanced from past years   a switch to   quot   tires and rims has certainly helped   also   i have been told that made a number of small suspension improvements to improve ride quality and responsiveness   i certainly have noticed the difference   the ride is still far from that of a touring car   but not at all unpleasant   when compared to my    mazda millenia   the taurus falls short   however   i feel it is not that far off from    honda accords and mazda   s i ve driven   it is certainly better than anything has produced in the past in this class of vehicle i like the fact that includes alloy wheels as standard equipment on the ses model   they add an upscale look to a   quot fleet quot   vehicle   access to the trunk is also significantly better   as is the usable trunk space   the squaring off of the rear deck provided these improvements   forward visibility is much better thanks to the redesigned headlights all in all   this is a very nice vehicle at a really great price point   in fact   i like it so much that i may end up buying a taurus or sable wagon next year when i retire my old volvo   wagon br br  
1051,1,  i just bought a new   taurus   weeks ago   and i ve put on   miles so far   overall   i am very happy with it body design the   taurus has a much cooler design than the bug eyed ovals of the last few year   i ve had many comments on how cool it looks   which is unusual for a family car   i read that they changed every body panel except the doors   unfortunately   the design of the doors should have been changed   too   it is very prone to door dings since the top half curves out past the rubber bumper on the door   interior the interior is great   both the front and back seats have a lot of leg room and elbow room   the controls are all easy to reach and easy to understand   engine i have a   valve engine   it has significant power   it accelerates well from a standstill and at high speeds   the engine is very quiet in the passenger compartment   i also test drove a volvo s   and the engine was very loud   sound system i have the mach audio system which is s top of the line   it sounds like a great home stereo system   my last car had s premium sound   and i was not impressed   the mach system is much better   one nice feature that my car has is a   disc changer with the cartridge inside the passenger compartment   this is available on the se comfort model if you get the floor shifter and center console   i also like that i have both a cd player and tape player other features automatic temperature control the automatic temperature control is a very nice feature   i can set a temperature and the car stays there   it is designed so most of the air blows toward the floor for maximum comfort   i really enjoy just setting the temperature to   or   and not messing with the controls after that adjustable pedals this is not a feature that i particularly wanted since i m pretty tall   however   it came with the car i bought   it seems like it would be a neat feature for someone who was shorter but wanted to sit further away from the steering wheel   with the touch of a button   you can adjust the pedals as much as   inches air bags i have side air bags   which is a nice saftey feature   in addition   the front air bags have extra sensors   the air bags will deploy at   different speed depending on the speed of the crash   the position of the seats   and whether the passengers have their seat belts on the driving experience is wonderful in this car   it is quiet   roomy   comfortable   and had a great sound system   i actually look forward to my commute for the first time in my life   i also love the new design i have had   minor problems   my airbag light came on   times in the first week   the dealership is not able to tell what may be wrong unless the light is on when i bring it in the second problem is that one of the back windows makes a clunk sound when it closes   the dealer attempted once to fix it   but he was unsuccessful   i will take it in again later br br  
1052,1,  my   month lease is set to run out on my   taurus wagon   i have really enjoyed the large cargo area provided with the rear seats folded down   my experience is that the drivers seat was very comfortable although the seat backs could use more side bolstering   this car was definitely not a sporty handler   but the ride was stable at speeds into the   s and was very comfortable under most conditions my car came equpped with leather seats   side airbags   and adjustable foot pedals which made it easy for the driver to find a comfortable position   the stopping distances recorded by independent testers were longer than average for this mid level bracket   another complaint is that while this is not a noisy car   neither is it as quiet as others in its   class   since i take some extremely long road trips   noise is something i really notice   if could reduce the engine noise   road and tire noise   and wind noise each a little bit it would greatly improve the driving experience   i felt that taurus wagon had good materials and features for the price  
1053,1,  i m a toyota person   but i came very close to buying the   taurus   i know that some people who have posted here have talked about reliability problems with   but i think that was with their older models this car has a very handsome outside styling to it and beautiful colors to choose from   their power driver s seat was one of the most comfortable   especially with the adjustable pedals    i have ever sat in   and i can t begin to tell you the discomfort of my corolla driver s seat   also   in my never ending new car search   the taurus was the most quiet at freeway speeds   the big   full center armrest adds a touch of luxury that seems to be missing from other cars in this class   the inside just felt so solid   sturdy   plush   and of course saftey   saftety   saftey   which is s whole selling premise with the   taurus   smart so why didn t i buy it   the gas mileage was a little low     street and   in the end   i just became obsessed with saving money and getting an   quot economy quot   car   not realizing that there s no value in saving money if you are dissatisfied in the long run   and gas prices are not going to stay high for ever   me and my   quot poverty thinking quot   i realize now that i should have just went with what i really wanted   there s more to buying a car than simply trying to save money on gas   my advice is to buy more car than you think you will need   you ll be happier in the long run   i ll have a difficult time deciding between a camry and a taurus the next time i go looking for a car   which could be sooner rather than later     
1054,1,  i do not actually own this   taurus   my parents own it   i own a   camaro and am used to a pretty uncomfortable ride   i am also used to extreme acceleration   the taurus has got the ride covered   it does not have the engine covered every time you start out riding in the tuarus   weierd engine noises accur   a sort of rattling and clanking if you will   it is a brand new car   so i do not expect anything like that to be happening   it also has a really hard time starting up and idiling at start up if it is cooled out the main and worst problem about this car is the pick up speed   very very pooor   we took it to the shop and told them of the poor pick up and they said its running fine throttle response is very poor   you can push the pedel up and down when travling above   or so and nothing will happen until you take it all the way to the floor   keep in mind that it is only a lx and is not a sports car   but that is saaad   also the radio is not very loud either but   it is very very roomy with plenty of head room and leg room   especially in the back seat   very large trunk space to put my bodies   i mean   no noise from the outside when in the car with the windows up  
1055,1,  i purchased my   taurus in   and at this time i have    miles on it   it has a    liter engine and when taking it on vacation i got   miles to the gallon   i have replaced tire rods on it   but by keeping the oil changed and keeping good coats of wax on it i hope to get more time out of the vehicle   there was a couple of winters i stored it but the vehicle has been ran all year round for about the last   years i really like how solid the vehicle is   the reason i know is i was hit from behind with a lot of force and it put just a little scratch on the bumper   the car rides very nice and has a large trunk perfect for taking on vacation   this car may not be for the single person   but it surly makes a good family vehicle     
1056,1,  while definitely not the most glamorous car to drive   the taurus wagon is an efficient   quot soccer mom quot   car   after owning the old taurus wagon model for a few years and having some problems i decided to trade it in for the    model and i m very glad i did   driving this car is a very pleasant experience   i have had no trouble with brakes   acceleration   or   unlike with the old model   the air conditioner heat   the driver s seat adjusts in many ways so that i can be comfortable when i drive and stay alert   even though there have been minor incidents in which this car has gotten roughed up   the only injury was done to the exterior appearance of the car   even though i ve only owned this car for about a year   i am still happy with the fact that i have not had reason to bring it in for any repairs   after owning the previous taurus wagon model and a volvo wagon   i m glad to say that this is the best station wagon that i ve come across br br  
1057,1,  i have owned my econoline full size van   with regency custom conversion for just over a year now   i love the van   it is such a comfortable ride compared to the other large vehicles on the market   like an expedition or suburban   because it isn t built on a truck frame   however   i have to say that dealing with the conversion people is like pulling teeth   because all of the interior parts are considered part of the conversion   i have to wait for every part to be ordered    even the seatbelts   which had dried glue on them   and any electrical problem is automatically blamed on the conversion people   the ground wire to the drivers side lighted vanity mirror was loose   so the light only worked intermittently   and it took several tries for them to finally get it right because they just kept trying to replace the part   not find the root of the problem   i realize that parts of this problem lies with the dealership   but they are the only regency approved dealer in my area   so i am forced to use them instead of an alternate dealer br br  
1058,1,  wow   what a truck   or should i say car with the way the expedition drives and handles   it does not feel like the    lbs truck it really is   i have the first model year     with the   l engine   and wd   it has the rear bench seat   towing package   dual zone climate control   and the premium sound system the steering is variable power assit   which makes driving a car of this size a lot easier   also   the larger engine helps with accelerating from a stop   but because of the immense weight of the car   you can forget about those quick   mph passing acceleration   and don t even try to pass anything going up a hill at a fast speed don t get me wrong   this car doesn t lack any   quot oomph quot   especially when it comes to towing   you don t even feel the weight of a    lbs boat behind you   and with a    lbs towing limit   you can certainly tow large loads of course   if you are towing anything   you want to make sure you can stop with all that extra weight   no problem   i think the expedition probably has the best brakes in it s class   you can t stop instantaneously   but for a car of it s size   you will be very surprised at how tight and responsive the brakes are if you are going to use this car as a   quot people mover quot   also   i would very strongly recommend that you buy the dual zone climate control   the powerful fans in these systems are ideal for any climate   they can heat the car faster then an explorer can   partly because of a very strong and powerful floor blower in the back   likewise   they can cool the car very quickly   and keep it cooled while the four wheel drive differential lacks a neutral setting   i highly doubt this will discourage most buyers from purchasing this car   the best   and most used setting by me   is the   quot automatic four wheel drive quot   in this setting   the car is supposed to enage the wd system when it feels tires spinning un evenly   it is a great added comfort for wet or icy roads   and can be used up to mph   the system will automatically detect if you are going over    and won t engage so as not to damage the transmission all in all   really came through with an amazing successor to the explorer br br  
1059,1,  my expy came with a trailer towing package   full power inside and inclement weather package   the a    liter   is very weak on power when towing   if your thinking of buying an expy and plan on towing anything   i strongly urge you to consider the bigger   you will find that while towing anything   slight upgrades in the road will cause your expy with the little to kick out of overdrive and into high gear   if you live in a mountainous area   then be prepared not to use overdrive overall   my expy is a comfortable ride and we have had little problems with it   the longevity of all motors is proven   but do consider an extended warranty as this vehicle has numerous sensors that can nickle and dime you   i did have a bad ride and alot of road noise with the goodyear tires that came on the expy from the factory   i switched to michelins and found the ride much better and the road noise gone   consider the michelin ltx m s series tire for your expy if you change tires i enjoy my expy and found it to be a comfortable ride   easy to manuever   stable at high speeds and during changing lanes and a real joy to drive   hope you have as good a luck with yours br br  
1060,1,  when i was first on the market for an suv   i was really looking for the explorer   a friend of mine has one and i absolutely loved driving it   it was a great truck   however   i couldn t find any decent   inexpensive   explorers and i settled for a jeep grand cherokee   this was a huge mistake after having the jeep for about three months   i was in an accident   i was coming home from work when someone slammed into my passenger side   the car buckled and was ripped apart   not only was i extremely shaken up   but i was also on the prowl for a new car thankfully my insurance is very understanding   and was extremely quick with my claim   i again set out looking for an explorer   however when i got to the dealership   i found that love at first sight does exist when i saw the maroon expedition   i was in love   this car is amazing   i know many people who look at it see only a massive road hogging beast   however the expedition is one of the most stylish   sleek   sporty suvs in my opinion   however   don t get me wrong   my expedition definitely has that rugged edge driving an expedition is something that everyone has got to get used to   even if you have driven an suv before the expedition is rather large   it takes some time to get used to   judging the distance from cars on your side and front is the most frustrating at times   but after a few drives   everything falls nicely into place once you ve mastered driving   you get the uneasy task of learning to park the beast   my first tip   stay away from parking garages until you are confident in your parking techniques   parking in a parking garage is generally awkward   however when you ad the size of the expedition   it gets even harder   not to mention the fact that   and it never fails   the first time you drive into the garage you will worry that your car won t fit if you live in a city   be forewarned parallel parking is rough   it is hard to find spaces to fit the car into   but don t stress it too much   because although rare they are there   with a mastery of driving and parking   the car is perfect   the seats are remarkably comfortable and the car is extremely roomy the only part of the car that there is little to no headroom is the third seat in the   way back   the third seat is slightly raised and because of that you lose a little bit of headroom   and if you are a taller person you lose all of your headroom   also   because the seat is raised   you don t have a place to put you legs   for my unfortunate friends in the   way back   i apologize   next time you ll remember to call shotgun won t you a few of the features that make the car even more comfortable   are the heating and radio features   first   my radio is a grade   a   cd tape player   with a six disc changer for the cd player   the speaker system is very good   and although many people will add a specialized stereo system to their cars   the factory works fine for me not only is the radio a great quality   but it has two sets of controls   the main console is in the dash board   however in the back seat   there is a separate console with a head phone jack for the people in the back to set their own stations according to their musical tastes   this feature is also found in the heating system   both the front and the backseat have climate controls   to set the temperature for both portions of the car if you are looking for a massive car that handles amazingly well   i d recommend that you at least test drive a expedition   the car is great   and it is one of the most comfortable rides i ve ever had  
1061,1,  dear s u v   shoppers   your reading my review on this vehicle in hopes i can tell you all about the expedition   well   your in a lot of luck because i have recently purchased one   this vehicle is a big thing on comfort   it used to be that if you sat in the back seat you were very uncomfortable   but in this vehicle the back seats are just as comfortable as the front   not only that   but as well as holding   passengers when the third row is set up this vehicle can tow a trailer behind it   for all you who show horses   and have a big family   you no longer have to rely on a pick up to get the job done   this means no more taking two vehicles and wasting money on gas   as for you who can t seem to stay away from the lake you can pull that nice boat behind you oh yeah   and don t forget all of your fishing buddies   when we first got our shiny new expedition everyone wanted to ride in it   one of the options we decided on was a six c d   changer   now there was no more reloading discs every time you wanted some new tunes   this came in as a nice option for the people in the back   for they could listen to the radio on headphones in the back when grandma up front wanted to listen to jazz   no offense to jazz   i love it   but some people don t   another thumbs up for the rear seat passengers are the separate heating and air conditioning controls for them   if they got could there was no more yelling at the driver to   quot turn the heat up quot    i think we all know how annoying that gets   that means comfort for the drivers ears   and no more headaches   either   well   to sum it all up   which is pretty hard to do   with everything this special s u v   comes with there s too much to say   now there s only one problem   who gets to drive br br  
1062,1,  as a busy mother with two children and always on the go   i live in my car   it is like my second home   i have to be able to keep things in my car   quot just in case quot   when i am away from the home   my expedition is big enough for me to do that without being   quot too bulky quot   and still look good we have been looking at the expedition since it first came out   we finally purchased one this past month   we looked at all the comparable suv s but we felt the expedition always came out ahead   it was big but not too big   we had the features of the larger suv   suburban   excursion   without the bulk and still the sporty look of the smaller suv   driving this vehicle makes me feel safe with the kids that s important it drives smooth   sturdy   and strong   i don t feel as if i am going to be blown over by the wind   if you are a busy mom that needs a reliable vehicle with lots of room yet doesn t look like a bus   this car is perfect for you unless of course you don t like driving big vehicles    br br  
1063,1,  i leased this vehicle for two years   it was the best vehicle i have ever owned leased   what i noticed the most was how well it handled   i was worried with such a large vehicle that it would be hard to control   it had a very smooth ride and the steering was so much better than the explorer i had before   i loved the heating cooling contols in the back of the vehicle   the room was so nice for my family of   as no one had to be crowded while traveling   the four wheel drive switch on the dash was awesome   i loved not having a shifter on the floor   the vehicle i leased had running boards which made it nice to get in and out of in a dress   it had a console with the cd changer inside   i loved being able to have   cd s in at a time and the ability to change them easily   i am not much up on the details of the engine   all i know is that it ran great and never gave me any trouble in the two years i leased   i am seriously thinking of leasing another one when the lease on our truck expires br br  
1064,1,  i purchased an expedition in april     quite by accident   the explorer that i had ordered was destroyed in the st louis floods   anyway   about the vehicle   a    the expedition was a joy to drive   luxurious and car like   wonderful on a long trip   four wheel drive made towing a large boat out of the water a breeze   even tore some trees out of the ground for a neighbour   no problem   the only problem i encountered in two years was a faulty solenoid on the four wheel drive   got it stuck in wd low   for anyone that this happens to   its an easy makeshift fix   the solenoid is readily accessible on the side of the drive   it is vacuum operated so if the solenoid goes   just disconnect the vacuum lines and switch them around   this will get you to a dealer without being restricted to mph gas mileage is not for the faint of heart or those relying on economy    miles per gallon in the city     mpg on the highway shear size alone guarantees when two cars are going for the same parking spot   you win everytime braking was excellent for such a heavy vehicle   lbs i miss my expedition br br  
1065,1,  we purchased our expedition after test driving both the expedition and the explorer   we are young with a growing family   so cabin space was very important to us   the expedition had much more cabin space   with the ability to put three car seats across in the middle seat   with the explorer   only one car seat would fit comfortably in the middle of the seat   we are very pleased that we purchased the expedition which gives us ample room for traveling to haul all the extras   it also has a third seat which is nice when there are more than   passenger   it has a very nice ride and is very comfortable to ride in   the only draw back is the high cost of fueling the gas tank   if you have   or more kids and are looking for a sports utility vehicle i definitely recommend the expedition br br  
1066,1,  all right   now that i m married and we have a great dane   i have grown out of my regular cab chevy   it has served it s purpose well and done everything i ve asked of it   but there is just not enough room anymore now being from texas   i m sure i m living up to every stereotype when i say    quot i love the f   crew cab quot this truck is a giant sure   but when it comes to comfort   power and styling you just can t beat this truck the one i drove had the lariat package which included all the bells and whistles   if your familiar with trucks   you know that this is the top of the line   and they like to charge you for it the leather seats do more than just hug you   they embrace you   after a hard day at work they just call out to you   and this is a truck that actually makes you look forward to the commute   it s that comfy this truck also makes you feel really safe   the one i drove was a x so i sat higher than just about everything else out there   i was almost eye to eye with the big trucks   that was kinda cool as for power   how does   hp      rpm and   lb ft of torque      rpm sound   yes   i had the powerstroke diesel   although this is not a choice for many people   this truck will out pull just about anything   and it looks good doing it another thing i like about the diesel is that it s like riding on a harley   the sound of it demands attention   of course this harley has a cab for    i got the bucket seats   air conditioning   cd changer   trip computer   and reliability one thing i haven t mentioned yet was rear seat comfort   well   you won t be disappointed here either   i believe it s rated at   quot   of head room and almost   quot   of leg room   this   shockingly   is more leg room than even the front passengers have   at    quot   i was more than pleased things i don t like   ground clearance   the truck i drove had the off road package   this includes two skid plates   one for the transfer case and one for the fuel tank   and a decal   with the size of this truck you think it would be perfect for doing a little trail riding   however   the   quot pumpkin quot   has only   quot   of clearance   i know   i know   that s what lift kits and   quot   tires are for   little news for you   even   quot   tires look a little small on this truck only other thing i don t like    parallel parking   never had to do it   just wouldn t happen so if you re in the market for a work truck   a crew cab   or even a half price hummer   this truck is for you br br  
1067,1,  don t laugh   but i love my escort   i am currently driving my second escort   purchased in    i call her trixie and she has carried me to and from work daily   on vacation and around town for the past six years   the odometer reads    miles but you need to add a digit to realize that it now has a total of    miles on it   yup     miles and still putt putt   putting up the road   i put well over   miles per day on the odometer   not counting side trips   my first escort lasted for seven years   so this one has already outlasted that one   all jokes and smug looks aside   anyone who has owned an escort will tell you that they are a good little automobile   replacing worn out parts is a fact of life   so i have never worried when i needed new brakes   timing belts or unfortunately a new transmission   a new transmission you say   yes   but it was no fault of the escort   it my own negligence that caused that problem   i remember well the day the mechanic asked me when i had last had the transmission fluid changed and i replied   quot changed quot   i think you can almost imagine the look on his face   the new transmission cost      parts and labor   but it was well worth the money   i preferred to invest that money in my little car rather than to put it toward the purchase of a new auto   i consider it the same theory as paying for a heart transplant for a loved one   the mechanic who put in the new transmission even admitted that he liked the little escorts and said he had purchased one for his son to drive   he explained that he called them   quot disposable cars quot   because typically   owners of escorts purchase them and drive them until they die along the side of the road   tires pointing up like poor little dead insects   most escort owners drive them until they have     miles on them   how many other auto owners can make that claim i love the size of my escort since it is easy to maneuver   living in ohio   where our winters can deliver deep snow and freezing rain   the front wheel drive is a life saver    literally so   all in all   i am terribly disappointed that has decided to stop making the escort   i have no idea what i will purchase next   but then i guess i still have over    miles left to make that decision br br  
1068,1,  after   years and    miles it s time to retire the escort   door   i ca nt say enough about this little car   i bought the car back in    for     after   years of commuting logging over    miles it s time for a new car   why you ask   the family does not fit in this little economy car anymore   it s still running great and ready to go   the only repairs to this car over the years have been   wheel bearing    timing belt    battery   and the head light bulbs   i ca nt believe it   all these years and so few repairs   the ride of the little escort is on par with most cars in this class   handling is good at speeds even up to mph   the fuel economy is amazing   this little car was outfitted with the   l in line   mated to a   speed manual transmission   the best highway mileage i have recorded is mpg on a trip from reno nv to salt lake city ut   the air conditioning works great   although there is a noticeable lack of power when the air conditioning is on   the seats are comfortable for the day to day driving   but for the long trips bring a pillow   the controls are all located in right places   no hunting for missing controls   the trunk and fold down seats are perhaps the best feature of all   i used this car for commuting around the san jose area as a computer networking consultant   for one particular job i needed to haul some computers to oakland   i was stunned when i fit   computers into the back of this little wonder   over the years this little car served me well and i would not hesitate in getting another one the stereo is not great   the little speakers that come in the escort are junk   if you like music   go out and get some good speakers installed   the transmission is great with one exception reverse   sometimes reverse can be a little tricky to engage   this problem was present from the first day i got the car   every mechanic i spoke to said this is normal for these cars   no big deal though   just put the car in first gear before you try to put it in reverse   doing this will get the gears to line up   and reverse is ready to use  
1069,1,  i bought my escort in   with k on it   now it has k and it is   years old   still   it hasn t had any serious problems   i only had to change worn out brake pads and tires   that s it   engine and transmission work like swiss watch   it handles road very good   i don t feel any inconveniences with steering   the only problem   as one reviewer had mentioned   was icy condition   you d need to learn pumping breaks with your foot   i did not have any crushes on icy road   but i was close once   some people consider automatic belts a nuisance   i even like them   never got caught by a trooper with belts unfastened   mounting a christmas tree on the roof   though   creates a problem   front seats have enough space for legs   but it may be a little cramped in the rear   trunk is surprisingly large for such a small car   i have a hatchback   but my friend owns a wagon   which i think is smarter   he can not be more happy about how much stuff he can load in his car insurance   i pay    per year for liability only living in cleveland area   the size of the car makes it quite unsafe   you can feel being blown from the highway when a large truck passes you   also   bumpers are plastic   sometimes it s hard to see what s ahead when an suv is ahead of you   the position of the rear view mirror is totally wrong   my wife is short    she can see from under it   but i have to bend my neck each time i need to look to the right i general   the car is very good   you won t have to worry about someone stealing it   it is great to commute   insurance is reasonable   it makes it excellent for students what else   reader s digest rated escort   as a recommended used car   
1070,1,  i grew up worshiping the quality of japanese   german and swedish cars   but i have to admit   my last few years driving this very inexpensive have convinced me to consider another one the next time i need a new car   while it isn t much to look at   it has been immensely practical and reliable   i inherited this vehicle from my parents   and as a poor college student at the time i couldn t say no   despite its   quot grocery getter quot   nature   now that i own a house   commute   miles to work in heavy traffic   and park in cramped lots   i appreciate its sizable cargo space   good gas mileage   and nimble handling   i recently recommended it to a friend and i recommend it to anyone out there who is looking for this type of vehicle   it is small and agile   with an excellent turning radius   it gets about mpg on mixed driving   can haul a lot more than you would think   and it s very reliable   mine has k miles with only minimal maintenance   new belts and an alternator at k   and oil every   k   it is a small car with a small engine    l   so don t expect to outrun anyone   but it does have enough pickup for a normal driving   even in the aggressive washington   dc traffic   the biggest problem   it s a station wagon and it looks like it   if you can swallow your pride   you ll save a lot of money with car br br  
1071,1,  we bought our car brand new four years ago   it was everything i wanted in a car   even the perfect color of green   we have an automatic with power windows   cd player from the factory   and air conditioning this car has been great   no major problems   we have had to replace the power window switch once   but other than that nothing major the only thing i would change about the car is something very simple and that is i would have a middle arm rest for the driver   like i said that is something that anyone can live without the car has great pickup pulling out on a major highway and also does great up mountains at first i worried about having a two door when taking others on trips with us   if i were to buy another car today i would probably buy a four door   because it is a little hard for adults to climb in the back seat of the car   as far as leg room it seems to have plenty for four adults we have taken two other adults on many trips with us and never hear any complaints on the leg room our car came with the extra stereo package which is great   it has a great sound to it the car rides very smooth and handles well i would recommend this car to anyone   in fact i just went with my little brother to buy his first car   he also got an escort a   model and he also loves his hope this helps   
1072,1,  i just want to say that i ve had my   x xlt fullsize bronco for   years now and i love it   i couldn t ask for anything more in a vehicle   the first thing that sold me on it was the intimidating appearance of the thing   it looks mean   the interior is very roomy and comfortable and gauges and switches are clear and easy to reach   currently it has    miles on it with not a lick of trouble   everything on the bronco is stock besides the   quot   tires and a dynomax turbo muffler   the ride is decent for a truck like suv   but the stiff suspension can really help out when off roading   the   l powerplant is surprisingly powerful   i can beat my friend s stock chevy z    even with my   quot   tires   although he hates when i bring it up   i don t see why people gripe and complain about the reliability of this vehicle   me and about   of my other friends have gone over    miles on our broncos     for me   without incident   i just think that some people don t know what the term   quot routine maintenance quot   means     
1073,1,  i had the opportunity to rent a fully loaded wd    l   edge edition supercab for   days recently   i was traveling through northern california and camping in big sur with stops in san francisco and lake tahoe initially   i was surprised that the i d reserved was such a highly optioned model   i d been expecting a wd    l v    extended cab model   apparently this is the only way budget equips rented from sfo   this was a pleasant surprise   but a surprise nonetheless   especially considering i d been quoted a rate of     day   truly a bargain the white edge edition is a sharp looking vehicle   with the performance to back up it s aggressive looks   the first thing i noticed when getting in was how stiff the seats seemed compared to my s   pickup   i felt like i was sitting in a truck   the lateral support seemed pretty much nonexistent   the interior was handsomely trimmed in typical style   driving the vehicle out of the garage one of the first things i noticed was a lot of tire noise from the knobby goodyear wranger rt s tires    this may not be the best long haul driver   i thought to myself during the course of more than   miles of driving in various conditions including some off road runs around big sur   i found the truck to be a trusty friend   it corners competently on the highway   with the power to pass and accelerate from a stop quickly   driving the winding roads on pch around big sur   the truck felt solid and well planted   switching to wd was a seamless affair with a simple dash mounted dial   the   speed automatic transmission was also faultless and very smooth the driving impression is quite different from my   s    which feels so carlike in most driving situations   the edge never let you forget it was a tall truck   the trade off for all the power was woeful gas mileage     mpg range   in all driving conditions   with gas costing     and more per gallon for regular in many california cities   it made for some painful gas stops   the   forward opening doors on the extended cab were very welcome   the chassis also seemed very tight and squeak free despite the large openings the truck s doors could provide   anyone who has these   doors will wonder how extended cabs ever did without them overall   i would say this is a very versatile vehicle with good looks and strong performance   the unremarkable seats   tire noise and poor mileage might make it tiresome to live with for some people   the   disc cd player also decided it wanted to keep my cds just before i returned the vehicle   i had to fiddle with it for more than   minutes before it decided to eject my cds   for the type of people in the wranger   xterra demographic   however   this is a great vehicle  
1074,1,  what does my f   x offroad have in common with submarines   airplanes   and   wheelers i ve flown my f   airborne many times   i ve driven in water over the hood i have the pictures   i ve towed overloaded trailers   i ve chased coyotes through rough terrain   i ve loaded the truck with over twice the weight rating i even put in a supercharger and pushed the    liter overhead valve triton v engine s power way past its design limits   it s been to the shop for oil   tires   brakes   plugs   a rear end oil seal   and one o sensor in    miles   we consistently choose our f   for long trips over our   f   and our   zx   it has the most sophisticated suspension of any truck i know don t let that scare you   its been very durable   it rides like a cadillac on the road   but handles bumps   rocks   mud   gravel   like a racing x   it holds onto turns in a gravel road very well   doesn t slide sideways the interior is very comfortable   fully adjustable seats and steering wheel   although the gauges are out of view with the steering wheel lowered all the way   the three door system and small rear seats are great for kids   but i wouldn t subject an adult to a very long drive back there   colder air   it was   this summer   than the   f   my biggest complaint about the drive system is the lack of limited slip   if you get one wheel in a muddy ditch   it will spin in the mud and rob torque from the other three   you can get an accessory that will eliminate the problem over      it does not have as much power or gas mileage as the chevy   but generally   does seem to forego power for reliability   and frankly   i d like it to last longer even if it isn t as fast about the   quot x offroad quot   option   you get    inch wheels with recalled lug nuts   your wheels can fall off with the old ones two   quot x offroad quot   stickers   a guard plate under the engine    quot offroad quot   does have a higher book value and does sit up higher   but ask yourself if its worth the price   and remember    quot   tires can be hard to get and pricey br br  
1075,1,  my former boss had one of these precious trucks and she let me drive it   well   i am originally a chevy only type but when i took off in this particular truck i feel in love with it the feature that i like the most are the third door and the bench seat in the front and back are so comfortable   its like a couch we hauled around a dozen kids   a soccer team   all day from game to game and they said it a smooth ride   from the cab when we went over rail road tracks it was very smooth   i got ta have it br br  
1076,1,  ok   right off i love this truck   we bought the    f   xlt shortbed   standard cab truck   and it was definitly worth buying   the price was very reasonable for the great quality we received it was used but the milage on it was very low   and the warranty had been extended for us for the term of the financing     big plus    it came with a c   abs   both driver and passenger airbags   and another plus is that the passenger side airbag can be turned off     great if you have to fasten a car seat in the truck     we have had the truck almost a year now and it has been outstanding   no major issues at all   because it is a truck it would not be good for families because of the lack of room   but this is an excellent work truck   even on long road trips the seats are very comfortable   driving it is a real pleasure   very responsive and handles well you want a good truck   go with the f   br br  
1077,1,  if you are a person who needs an all around versatile vehicle   then the f   extended cab pick up is what you want i recently purchased one   and it is the first full sized pick up i have ever owned   i have   children   and did not think a pick up would be a practical choice for me   considering the fact that you need room in a family vehicle for the entire family i had always borrowed a pick up from my families shop when i needed to haul a load of wood   hay   etc much to my surprise   this pick up had much more room than the sport utility vehicle i had previously been driving   and it has a third door   which completely erases the problem of trying to load kids   groceries   saddles   or whatever you need to put in the back seat   three seatbelts in the back ensured the safety of all my children   and in front are   air bags   with a shut off for the passenger side air bag in case you have a fourth child the rear seat is also split   and can be folded down entirely or independently   depending on how much room you need   and when folded   it is a solid metal bottomed cargo area it has a v   engine   with a convenient switch to take you easily from   wheel drive to   wheel drive   it is the most comfortable and easy to drive vehicle i have ever owned   and i can haul anything   i haul wood   hay   wood chips   gravel   rocks the pretty kind   i am an avid rock hound   lumber   you name it   you have the room and the power to haul just about anything so the next time someone says    quot pick ups are a mans work vehicle quot   you can say    quot pick ups are for women and families too quot br br  
1078,1,  we bought our    f    extended cab   xlt   flareside   x   in    it has the   l v    we ve now had it for just over   years   we don t put much mileage on her and she just turned   miles our biggest complaint   is low fuel mileage   she s only getting about    mpg   that s all city driving it s roomy   sharp looking   runs great   probably not even broke in yet   and has plenty of interior room   back seat folds down   so can use that area for cargo   without getting the seat dirty   the seats are comfy   the sound system is awesome it s nice to hit a button on the dash   to go into x   rather than having to step out   to lock in hubs   that   l v   has plenty of power   for towing a horse trailer   boat or r v we do love the look of the interior   but feel that could use a little less plastic   for that caliber of vehicle br br  
1079,1,  i bought this vehicle along with my husband   his dream truck   and fell in love with it to   i couldn t believe that i   as a woman   older one at that   could find this    xlt pickup   so comfortable and so much fun to drive   i find the control and driving real pleasureable and exciting   the only disconcerting thing is that i have to step up into it   i m just glad that it has handles to assist   the driving is just as easy as driving my sable which is a power steering   the xlt has   wheel drive when you need it and it s easy to shift it into   wheel drive   i would recommend this truck to anyone   it s comfortable   fun   and easy to drive   even for a   year old bat like myself   i wouldn t say that a young person would appreciate all of the qualities of the xlt but i guess that s why they built them   quot tough quot   even for an adventerous young person     
1080,1,  i bought my   contour used last june   my overall impression of the car is good   i bought the   speed because i think it is more fun and easier to control   especially in the snow   front wheel drive also makes it great for snow driving   there are so many things i like about it   cruise control and tilt steering wheel dual airbags   abs brakes   a c and power door locks   windows and mirrors   i guess what i am saying is that it has all the bells and whistles i like   i bought it because i wanted a larger car   i had a   door neon   that was more comfortable   the seats in the contour are so comfy   i test drove a brand new escort zx   or something like that   the newest one   and sighed a huge sigh of relief when i got back into my contour   this car is not a sports car by any means   but it has get up and go as well as comfort   there are a few things i would change though   one is the cupholder   yes   only one   it is pathetic and broken already   another thing i would change is the mechanism to recline the seat   i have to roll it backward over and over to recline   same to put it upright again   a major waste of time   i would love my car more if it got better gas mileage   i average mpg   there have been several instigated recalls for warranty repairs   however in my case they were all preventative as i have not had a single problem in the past   months   i did buy the extended warranty though   those bells and whistles get pricey to fix   i would say test drive one   you might like it br br  
1081,1,  my previous car was in the shop for repairs and i had to rent a car    contour was what i rented and i really enjoyed   the car has a personality that i love to drive   while the price for a new car was out of my reach   i found a great value in a barely used   model   while the car doesn t have a large engine   it has plenty of pickup and handled large inclines easily   the only problem i found is head space   i am over   foot tall and it can become a little uncomfortable in long drives   the front wheel drive and stable wheelbase   makes it a easy car to drive and get through town to get the daily errands accomplished update   august   the car is now   years old and has    miles plus   the continues to run smooth and very reliable   the interior has held up and is in very good condition   the exterior is very good for this amount of use   i drive is daily   thus there are many dings and scratches from rocks and other debris in the road   the car has had a couple of recalls and has fixed them quickly   both recalls were for things that i was not experiencing   brakes and exhaust   the only negative thing to mention is the ride   our other car is a   caravan   the smoothness of the caravan makes the contour seem alot rougher   over a week may go by and i won t drive the van and the contour seems very smooth   but then i drive the van and the i become less pleased   i would definitely recommend this car to anyone who is wanting a good car to last a long time  
1082,1,  the car is one of the best i have driven but if you live on a gravel road you are in for some surprises   the gravel roads tend to put the car to the limit   i have occasionally had to do some adjustments to the cars suspension system and had to rewire some of the wiring in order to get the car to perform the way it was intended   a few of the places that need to be fixed were the dash lights i had to put in a wire protector in order to keep the wires from wearing from the bumps on the road   the other problem i have had is with the courtesy lamp after about   year of driving it i had to replace it because the switch fused together and kept blowing fuses   the car i really don t think was meant for driving on gravel roads   another problem is you have to constantly have to lubricate all hinges and locks in order to keep them from locking up and causing damage   these things are minor but they provide numerous headaches if you are not expecting them to happen     
1083,1,  our lives were in the early stages of a complete overhaul   well   not entirely   we were driving an old corolla with nearly    miles on it and were becoming cramped   my wife was in the end stages of her first pregnancy and we wanted a minivan truthfully   i hadn t even considered a   no pun intended   i was focusing primarily on the mercury villagers   we wanted something with power   reliability   comfort   and a good look   quite frankly   the aerostar was not my first choice aerostar s have a tendency to rust   i certainly don t want to drive a rust bucket   they seemed a bit bulky and their style never really changed in all the years of their manufacturing   it just wasn t the van i was looking for however   some friends of my parents were selling their   aerostar extended van   i just happened to be visiting my parents in detroit and thought it might be fun to check out an aerostar   i have to say that i was impressed   the van was a two tone maroon and tan   it had fiberglass running boards giving it a sort of solid    quot cruising quot   appeal   this aerostar was clean and elegant the interior was customized boasting of quad captains chairs   plush carpeting   color tv   and oak trim throughout   the extended rear left plenty of room for strollers   pack n   play s   and luggage   passengers found themselves in a comfortable situation without feeling cramped or inhibited i fired up the    liter v engine only to find it quiet and smooth   the van rolled down the road with ease and the acceleration left nothing to be desired   handling was impressively good considering its size and shape   the odometer read only    miles   needless to say   i bought it i have been very pleased with this van   not long after i purchased it we packed it with seven people   an over abundance of luggage   and drove to pittsburgh   there was plenty of room and the engine bolted up and down those steep pennsylvania hills like a champ   my only criticism is the cost of repair   though it is not scheduled for a tune up until about    miles it will cost me approximately    because of the compact engine compartment   i did have the drive belt replaced recently and it only cost me     i suppose   like most cars   the various repairs will balance out   this is a good vehicle and one that deserves consideration   i would buy another br br  
1084,1,  the f   is a great work truck   its also a great family truck   it has many options which include   power windows and door locks   quad cab   four doors   bed cover   cd player   four wheel drive it is easy to work everything in this truck   its roomy in the front and the back   it has a very smooth ride   this truck can tow a good sized travel trailer or a good sized horse trailer   i love the four wheel drive i probably have over    miles of four wheeling in this truck and i have never gotten stuck   its a good truck for people who want the towing ability and also the roomy cab   it is big so i wouldn t recommend it for people who feel insecure about big vehicles br br  
1085,1,  ok   i have reviewed the gt and the gt mustangs   but currently i can t locate any better place to post this opinion that might save you    the intake manifold on the   gt was made of a composite material   unfortunately   the material was not strong enough to handle the horsepower of the v   so at around    to    miles it cracked intake manifold acts as a cooler where water and antifreeze circulates   you can probably drive your car for a few miles after there is no water in it   but its damaging and dangerous   you can even burn your engine doing this   and believe me   sohc v does get hot   recalled   gt s and replaced the intake manifolds with more durable ones   which were used on   and   gt s if you do a research for a recall on your gt   you will find that there is one   unfortunately   some of the gt s also came out of the factory with the weak manifold   there is no recall on the gt   and quite a few people have spent   bucks on a new intake because of this here is what won t tell you   the intake manifold is really their problem   and even if your car is out of warranty   its their responsibility to replace it   if you own a gt   and your intake cracks   do not pay for a new intake   take it to   and tell them what happened   they will say that there is no recall on your car   act like you know what you are talking about   and tell them you spoke to and they said there is a   program   on the manifold   they will change it within a day at no cost to you   given that the manifold is indeed cracked   make sure that it is   otherwise they will charge you    just for looking at it   also   you can get the svo supercharger or the aliminum svo intake with a    discount if you loose your manifold   the supercharger is k   and will be dropped down to   k    its worth about hp   the aliminum intake is worth about hp   and is a good base power mod if you are planning to go real fast in the future    ex   get a vortech s   trim   etc br br  
1086,1,  i m not exactly an unbiased author   i ve owned a corral of late model performance mustangs that include a   lx   l    cobra   and a   gt   l   for my wife   i recently purchased a   performance red gt   is there really any other color   to replace the    upon its mechanical demise   i researched the   thoroughly and quickly discovered that its entry level invoice price was below all the other american vehicles of comparable size that offer styling or performance to match   such as the camaro z   pontiac firebird   pontiac grand am   pontiac gran prix gtp    amp   chevy monte carlo   even factoring in a fully optioned gt   the price remained about    below comparable models   when you see the   k price on my epinion   keep in mind that it is   k out the door with every option available   my   is a gt coupe with leather   auto    quot   wheels   and the mach   sound system   those are option packages provide all the extra stuff included with the option package price   the gt package gives you all the mechanical   amp   performance stuff to go along with the   l   the leather group provides all the electrically adjustable seat controls   just for the driver   though   the   quot   wheel option gives you the bigger tires   amp   wheel locks   and the   package gives you all the extra speakers and cool stereo with cd   virtually all mustangs come with the   quot power equipment group quot   which gives you the power locks   windows   steering   brakes    amp   mirrors   there s another   quot convenience group quot   which comes on virtually every which provides front mats   air conditioning   and rear defroster   the gt option also provides   new   since the    models   features for the   abs   amp   electronic traction control   the abs is what you d expect   the etc is a system that senses rear wheel spin on acceleration   now how would that happen   and uses the abs system to apply the brakes to the spinning wheel and uses the electronic engine control system to temporarily   quot de tune quot   the engine to stop it from revving up until the wheel stops spinning   it s definitely weird to experience the etc system at work   but i guess it s a good thing   thank goodness it has an   quot off quot   switch   though   so    k is about all you can spend on a well equipped coupe   the convertibles   amp   cobras would require more money   i may have forgotten to purchase the lighted vanity mirrors   but if my wife can live without   em   so can i    that s got a genderist tone   doesn t it how s the performance   i was skeptical about the   l s ability to carry on the s mystique and performance image   but i am consistently impressed   i am certainly no stranger to the push rod performance of the   l   and though the   l is considerably different in its personality   smoother   amp   silkier   its performance is every bit as respectable as its predecessor   some people may dislike the    s decided lack of harshness typically associated with old school pushrod engines   but time marches on and the   l will definitely win you over   as far as the modification potential of the   l goes   i can t say as i am a bit of a lightweight there and usually stick to stock   styling   in performance red   the heads turn   the    is a bit bulkier   amp   angular and more likely to appeal to the men   sorry if that s genderist   i didn t mean to be   but it definitely looks great from any angle   exterior styling is always a matter of personal taste   so glance at a picture and see what you think   the car does seems to look better with more time spent looking at it the interior is a carry over with subtle refinements from the   re style   it is modern without being quirky and very functional   comfort abounds   and i really don t have any criticisms   you can visit one of those online car buying services   like carorder   and take their   quot    interior view quot   virtual tour for the   and what you see there is pretty much what you get   no surprises   from my vantage point   it is unchanged from my wife s     interesting side note   may be saving money by making leather available on only the front seating surfaces now   my    had   seat leather   and no option package has rear floor mats   so be prepared to shell out an additional     for them   not a deal killer   but irritating   other irritants   mild   for the interior include the lack of glove box light   i m nitpicking here   and the seat belt loops attached to the seat backs must go   i removed mine and i hope i can do that without compromising the safety or operation of the belts   well   maybe now my forehead bruises from reaching into the back seats and banging into those stupid loops will heal   the rear seat back fold down trunk entry feature is a real plus   i guess i m getting older because i care about the stereo in a sports car   the s mach   system is heaven   no complaints here   all in all   the interior is a comfortable   thoughtful   and handsome package irritants aside   another interesting side note   for the money   the late model has always provided full analog instrumentation included in the base cost   that instrumentation includes a speedo   duh   a tachometer   temperature gauge   oil pressure gauge   fuel level gauge   duh again   and ammeter   all of this is presented in an attractive and properly placed cluster that avoids all of that stupid gimmickery that plagues less thoughtful vehicles   no digital stuff   excluding the odometer   that will burn out   blink   and stop working   no overly large speedo   temp   and fuel level gauges that are large in order to hide the fact that all    engine sensors are wired into a single   quot service engine soon quot    ok   i m gm bashing sorry   light   with the s gauge cluster   you can monitor the   quot traditional quot   engine conditions without worrying about a catastrophe coming without any warning   hey   finally the has a   quot low fuel quot   light side view visibility is awesome now thanks to the revised roof line shape and the quarter window placement   that was a real hazard in the    hatchback models   speaking of hatchback models   i remain curious if i will eventually miss the convenience of the hatchback configuration   i think i will   the trunk access of the post   models is not very good when put to the   quot luggage test quot   perpetual   quot jockeying quot   of luggage items while half in and half out of the trunk is always necessary to get them in all the way   there s a low ceiling to the rear trunk area due to what i think is the rear speaker assembly   so   when you imagine you can shove tall items to the rear   you usually have to break out   quot plan b quot   i would ve considered a hatchback model again if offered in a structurally rigid platform   the structural integrity of the post   models is excellent and maybe maintaining that integrity was at least a partial concern in not making a hatchback   my    was a hatchback and never quite had that   quot new car quiet quot   feeling due to very small rattles that became not so small as time wore on   speaking of rattles   there seemed to be numerous   amp   negative comments on the fit and finish of late model mustangs   and i was curious as to whether i would be impressed or not with the assembly quality of my    well   suffice it to say that the comments seem to be warranted as far as my wife s    goes   body seams are visually off   some of that may be due to what is ridiculously complicated styling in some areas   like the rear face   her outer side support cushion on the driver s seat is breaking down   and there are some interior finishing strips that aren t adhered well   the car has k miles and is exactly   years old now   so maybe some of that is to be expected   i maybe thought would ve come further since my     which shared some of that charming shoddiness   but the    was a     car   not a     one   oh no   now i ll get all those economist emails reminding me to adjust for inflation or the gnp   you get the picture   though   my   seems much tighter and quieter   and the body seams are excellent   so   maybe improvement has been achieved in that department let s go driving   the   l has a   rpm   approximately   redline and the   l has a   rpm redline   that fact alone illustrates the difference in their personalities   the   l launches off the line brutishly and pulls like a freight train while revving below   rpm   the   l has a constant pull that isn t quite as strong   but goes on and on   steady and strong   until   rpm   so   the new ones take a little getting used to in the way of letting them rev up   besides   there s nothing like hearing a v    even a small displacement one   smoothly rev up that high   the   s exhaust note is awesome and a little lower than the    s   it has that great   quot throaty quot   quality and sounds very much like the   l at idle   my muffler technician described the    exhaust as    quot one of the best looking   best sounding stock exhaust systems out there quot   the    s is just as satisfying   it combines the great throaty quality of v s with the loud growl of small displacement engines into a purely intimidating   and obnoxious   note   great looking pipes   too   that s important   i m not gm bashing here   but is anyone at the looking at the exhaust pipes when they re designing the cars handling is excellent as expected   the structural rigidity does wonders for enhancing the ride and the control   the    models required you to do all the rigidity work yourself in order to get that kind of integrity   after doing all that reinforcement type of work   your car   well   mine at least   finally had that flat cornering    quot ride on rails quot   feeling   the new ones inspire that kind of confidence without the harshness   hey   i m    and the harshness issue suddenly seems important   the   quot   wheels look a little lost in the large fender wells   the s look just right   i am a little dismayed at s putting h rated tires on a gt   if you get the   quot   wheels   and making you shell out extra for a set of real tires   i think anything calling itself a performance coupe should have v or z rated tires   at least   keep in mind that in pure stock configuration   the gt can exceed the speed rating of h rated tires hmmmmm i m thinkin    quot firestone     the sequel quot   happenin   here for the mechanically curious     my gt has    miles on it now   and i ve been to the dealer once for warranty work on the rear axle carrier bearings   i don t know what i think of that yet   i had just been on a twisty n calif coastal road where i thought i d see how spirited the car could get no abuse here   just alot of fun   the carrier bearings started making noise the very next day   defective set   did i break   em on my abuse session   are they of a weak design   i dunno    gas mileage is at    with a    mix of town driving   amp   freeway raging   all town miles will yield just under    and all freeway   excluding stop and go commutes   will get you around    not bad at all    the   l is all aluminum   so beware of engine heat conditions   the warranty expressly excludes any damage due to overheat conditions   if you see the radiator warning light come on   stop immediately and get out the tow truck   the warranty also excludes damage due to lack of cooling system service   go every year to the dealer and get documented servicing of your cooling system yea   there s faster   for a bunch more money   yea   there s better looking   a matter of taste   but no car crosses the performance styling curve with the dollar curve quite like the   it all comes down to value br br  
1087,1,  ok   folks   here we go   for any of you that have been around long enough to see the introduction of the in    officially released as a     model   i feel sorry for you   not because you re old   bad joke   please take no offense   but because you had to see the go through a radical transformation from a true muscle car to nothing more than an expensive pinto in the late   s   to an underpowered gt car in the late   s   to an even heavier   quot sports car quot   in the mid   s   but with the introduction of the newest comes many improvements over the previous generations   beyond your wildest imagination   first off   i should say that this is finally a sports car again   it s got a revised    liter v   and although still a pushrod engine   makes a respectable   hp that hurdles the   spd coupe    in    seconds   this torquey v makes lots of its power down low and has over   ft lbs of torque that makes driving a whole lot of fun   coupled with a new rear axle ratio   and rear wheel drive   but the real fun is in the gt   with the v   having the same displacement and sharing many of the parts with the former    l v   it produces hp   up from the old   hp v in    coupled with the    performance axle   it flies to   mph in    seconds   and gets to the quarter mile in   seconds flat at   mph   to put that into perspective   the much revered   lamborghini countach took a full half second longer in the    mile   kudos to for finally making a that for once looks good   not since   has a turned so many heads   they new edgy styling will last longer than the sedan like styling of the last generation   and finally makes it look like a sports car   although the scoops on the hood and behind the doors aren t functional   they do give it a sharp appearance   the all new   spoke wheels on the gt model are classy and sporty   and coupled with the    zr   s help the to achieve skidpad grips of    g s   which haven t been equaled by mustangs before with the exception of the cobra s   the rides surprisingly well for a sports car   the ride is supple   and firm enough to have appropriate and confident handling on smooth surfaces   however   because it still has a solid axle and hasn t updated its rear suspension to irs   independent rear suspension   since its introduction   it can get a bit spooky on uneven   bumpy surfaces   aside from that   handling characteristics are favorable   with mild understeer   the bfg comp ta tires are sticky enough to handle most situations   while maintaining a smooth ride   although there are so many things to praise about this car   it s far from perfect   in a world where japanese standards of fit   finish and ergonomics have heightened the level of excellence   the falls short of impressing me   the dash is attractive   but the instrument cluster can look a bit dated at times   the fit and finish of the car have much to be desired   as well   by far the worst thing in the new are its seats   both front and rear   the front seats are   in a word   unsupportive   i d rather drive cross country in a vw jetta than this   for short rides the front seats are fine   but long trips find your back and behind sore and aching   the rear seats   if you can call them seats that is   give you enough legroom if you re about   or    for real sized people   you might want to hitchhike   i would advise all sports car enthusiasts who love the feeling of rwd and gobs of torque to buy this car   especially the gt v   in case you re wondering   it can be fairly convenient   because the trunk has more than adequate space for storage   on that note   it can be attractive to more than just speed freaks due to its large storage space and ease of use   by the way   like i said before it s a real head turned   guys and girls both like the styling   especially of the convertible   so if the old adage is true about dating someone for their car   you might want to consider this one br br  
1088,1,  wow   the saleen   sr is highlighted by a    liter based engine producing   horsepower and   lbs of torque mated to a saleen six speed transmission   talk about power and beauty in all of the right places   with just about every part in this car specially made   the only thing not unique about it is the windows   besides it s great looks and mean engine   the saleen sr also boasts a starting price of      although expensive   every penny would be worth it because this special edition car has the reputation of saleen and the reputation of proving itself on the track   a little about saleen   since the s beginning in    saleen has produced over    vehicles   more than any other specialty manufacturer has done   the s line includes other vehicles that range in the mid thirty to forty thousands such as   saleen s   s sports cars   saleen xp and even the explorer sport utility vehicle   the also produces performance parts which would greatly increase the performance of your   for more info   visit saleen    
1089,1,  i love my     the car that i traded in was a   convertible   that car gave me a few problems   but i went ahead on and tried another   i was looking for a new car because i was ready to get married   my husband went with me   we both fell in love with this car   i have a bright atlantic blue   it is a pretty color   i don t see very many of the same color as mine   the interior is light gray and dark gray   the seats are light gray my car has only given me one problem   the air conditioner vents did not turn from side to side   i took the car to the local dealership and told them   they looked at the car and ordered the parts   i took the car back in and they put in new air conditioner vents   this is the only problem i have had   the car is great   the interior of the car is a light gray   the car is an automatic   it has power windows   power door locks   cd player   tape player   cruise control   automatic driver seat   automatic mirrors   overdrive and it has an anti theft device built into the car   if someone doesn t have the right key   the car will not start   i had a key made at wal mart and it will unlock the doors   but you can t use it to drive the car with   it also has a remote control for the car   it has lock and unlock for the doors   trunk and panic button the driver panels are the speed   oil gage   temperature gage   gas gage and the battery   it also has lights that light up for different reasons   like the seatbelt   overdrive off   or low fuel   the seatbelt warning goes off every now and then   if you don t buckle your seatbelt up the gear shift is located in between the seats   it has park   reverse   neutral   drive     and    the overdrive button is located on the gear shift   there is a console in between the front seats   it has slots inside if for cd s   there is also a change tray located between the gear shift and the console   the doors also have   pockets   to place objects in   when i am out on the highway and i want to   get up and go   it goes   some cars that i have had before if you push the gas it is still going the same speed   not this one   you want to go   it goes   the car s body style has not changed much over the last few years   i has just been the head lights and tail lights that change   the body is just about the same as it was when they changed to this body style in    the inside of the car is great   i love having the tape deck and the cd player   i have lots of cds but i also have quite a few tapes so that gives me more of an option of what i can listen to   the control panel for the cd player   the tape deck and the air conditioner are all in the middle   that makes it easy to get to for the driver the cruise control is located on the steering wheel   the buttons are cruise   coast   and resume   cruise is to set it   coast to slow down   resume to go back to the speed that you were at before   the windshield wipers are on the side of the steering column   this is also the same as the blinkers and the headlight brightner dimmer   the emergency blinkers are on the top of the steering column   the headlights are on the left side of the steering wheel   there is an interior light for when the doors are open   when you get into the car and close the door   the light stays on until you start the car   this is very helpful at night time to see the ignition   when you get out the light also stays lit until you lock the doors   it also goes off automatically this car has an automatic window defroster for the back window   this helps in the winter time to defrost ice and snow   the heater has defrost   floor and mix   mix is the floor and defroster   the heater air conditioner is a round circle that goes from cold to hot   blue to red   the air conditioner has max a c   normal a c   and vent   the max blows a little harder than the normal   vent is just for outside air   the only thing that i don t like is that the seats could be a little softer than what they are   i love the automatic seat for the drivers side   there is not one on the passenger side   but they are ok   the front seats are bucket seats   the back seat is two different seats   they lay down to the inside   in case you have something in the trunk   there is not much leg room in the back seat   it is comfortable enough for my son   he is only five   so he is comfortable in the back seat   most adults would not be comfortable in the back seat   unless they are short   i have ridden in the back seat   i am     and there is enough leg room for me   but it is not for very tall people the trunk has an automatic opener on the key chain and also inside the glove box   there is also a safety feature on the inside of the car s trunk   there is a cord to pull in case you get locked in the trunk   to pop the trunk from the inside   the trunk is carpeted and has the donut tire underneath the carpet   it is a pretty roomy trunk for a sports car   my car has a spoiler on the trunk   there is a third brake light in the spoiler this car drives great   the car accelerates when you want it to   it is a fun little car to drive   the brakes also work well   when you need to stop and stop fast   it does   the cars performance driving is great   it takes off and slows down when you want to   it handles the road good   it is easy to drive   i love everything else about my car   my next car after this one will more than likely be another   they have me sold on this   little pony   if you have not ever had a you need to drive one   you might really want one after you do   thank you for reading   have a good night kimberly
1090,1,  let me start with one comment   i have always wanted another   owned a     years ago   it came time for the family to purchase a second car   since we were already in possesion of what i believe to be the best sedan in the world   a    honda accord ex   i decided that rather than go with the suv   living in the midwest   this makes more sense   i would get me a car i ordered a   gt convertible   speed manual   after an incredibly long delay waiting for to build my car   it finally arrived early summer   this car is the ultimate summertime vehicle   drop the top and go   with the optional mach sound system you will have no problem hearing your favorite tunes as the wind whistles by i am by no means any kind of motorhead   so don t look for performance figures or anything else like that in this opinion   but i do enjoy being behind the wheel and after   years of driving i am still trying to figure out how i never truly experienced driving until getting behind the wheel of this car   there is tons of power in the v engine   the seating is comfortable   even for a tall man and there is surprising room in the back for   young children   i realize that i will have to give up the car by the time the kids hit   or so   but until then   the whole family enjoys it you re not going to be taking this car to the grocery store   or anywhere else that requires putting anything in the trunk   there s room for a set of golf clubs   barely   and that s about it   so forget hauling groceries for all of the power   the car handles remarkably well too   as long as you are on dry pavement   any little bit of moisture on the ground and look for the rear tires to slip   even with traction control on   i fear that this car will spend a lot of time in the garage during the winter months as i imagine the snow traction to be non existent i could give you about   reasons to not buy this car   but instead i will give you the   reason to buy it   it is fun br br  
1091,1,  did a brilliant job when it created the   it is sleek and powerful   just driving the car can make anybody feel young again mustangs come in three varieties   standard v   gt version   and svt   generally it correspods to what type of engine you get   the latter being the more powerful   the best part about owning a is that the interior of the base v is the same as the gt or the svt save the emblems   you don t feel like you are getting the base model   it feels like your getting the best model i own a   v and my roomate has a   svt   we both love our mustangs   we know that not many other cars can keep up with us   say a vs a civic   or a vs a prelude   i think for the price the is the best car out there   just knowing there is something powerful under the hood and the car is not just looks is one of the things that make a great when driving a   the whole sports car feel is there   a stiff suspension   a nice sounding engine   and a instument panel that has gauges for everything   one thing though   it would have been better if the had four wheel independent suspension   but it still handles very well the is not as quiet as say a lexus   but it isn t supposed to be   you are supposed to hear the roar of the engine when driving a sports car   the sound only adds to the effect only people who can picture themselves in a sports car should buy a   one thing though   you must be sure of your driving skills because one your behind the wheel you will really want to drive it br br  
1092,1,  the new generation contiues in the greatness of the line   the new styling is both aggresive yet civilized   the standard engine the v   is still very powerfull but to opt for the   horse power v in the gt is a worthwhile purchass   the convertable has no problems   no leaks or tough situations for up or down movement   the has incredible road manners   with plenty of power and tourque it has passing power on the highway   and a great drive through country winding roads   the car handles quite well for seating   adults   the two in the back are a little uncomfterble the trunk space is quite large because of the hatchback design of the car   holding about    on the skidpad is a very good score   the is a car that can be owned by anyone   for the exectutive or the person just looking for some style   the only down side to the is its rear wheel drive   in the winter snow can cause a small problem   but wiht the available traction control deep snow is the only problem   the is a great car for anyone   and with a low sticker price and high performance rating it is a great deal     
1093,1,  if your in the market for a great car   and you want a convertible   get this car   the   model edition is the best one yet   the top folds down quicker than ever   and the car has been made ven more powerful   the hp is about    the car also sounds great   with the classic sound   this car also excelerates extremly well   and can beat out   year old s anyday   the car is very appealing in yellow   and where ever you go people will tur their heads and look at this amazing car   when people see this car   they wish to themselve s i wish i had that car   over all this is a great car   and everyone should get it br br  
1094,1,  i drive a   v   this car gives you a lot of bang for the buck   the hood   bumpers and trunk are of a composite material which means they will not rust   it also makes the car lighter   the good part is the winter won t rust the car out   but the car is lighter    for winter driving   with this car being a rear wheel drive   put some weights and get good winter tires   if you are to drive it in the snow   of course rear wheel drive is fun though   for going around corners the car handles well and is a dream to drive   the seats are comfy   and adjust well   the gages and interior is basic   but doesn t give you that   cheap   feel   like a typical gm car   sometimes the dash squeaks   but only rarely   the sound system is good   even with the basic system the air conditioning is very good   and so is the heating   the back seat is short and not comfy for people taller than     the v will not win you an indy    but the gas mileage is very good   and another thing    this car is sexy   you can also spend more money like any other car   but the aftermarket for the is awesome there are a lot of toys you can buy to make your stallion fly don t let anyone tell you is junk   has their problems   but so does gm   toyota   honda and whoever else   the difference with this car is that it is easy to get parts for   and cheap to repair   nobody should laugh at you for owning a   not everyone wants a rear wheel drive sports car   but if you re looking for something fun take a look  
1095,1,  why did i buy a   gt well first i owned a   mach for the last   years and i can not tell you how much fun i had driving it this car made me a   quot king of the road quot people would stop traffic to let me out of parking lots parking spaces and even to exit driveways i think they just wanted to get a glimpse of american automotive history the is more than just a vehicle it is a symbol of who you are i love the way people would give me the thumbs up when they pulled up next to me or the stories they would share with me at car shows about their mustangs that they owned or own they spoke about them as if they were a part of the family and that s how i felt about my old the most common phrase i hear is   quot i should never have gotten rid of my old quot   well when it came time to purchase a new car i had plenty of choices but i knew i wouldn t be truly happy unless i was behind the wheel of my true love the   as for driving one my test drive of the standard shift   gt at the dealership was very pleasing the sound of the engine as i let the clutch out and drove out of first gear was so smooth and pleasing the power was on tap at all times braking was excellent the all four disc brakes were a first time experience for me and i loved it the handling was quite nice sharp turns were point and execute no questions asked i felt like the car was built around me in the drivers seat everything was within reach excellent view of the road front and rear   i can t wait for my new to arrive from the dearborn assembly plant i think i made the right choice heck i know i made the right choice mustangs are for anyone who wants fun performance and a little bit of american automotive history of their own as i tell all the cheverolet lovers the stampede is louder than the heartbeat br br  
1096,1,  i have owned my   v stang for   months now and am loving it more every day   what an awesome car   there really is just something about a   especially one that is powerful   beautiful and sounds like thunder   i added about    in add ons to my stang    gt dual exhaust and a cold air intake    mac products    it was awesome before but now it s even better   it sounds and feels like a hot v and is quite a bit faster that stock v s of only a couple of years ago   i have owned   cars   of them were imports and i have had   transmissions go out out on those   cars   the   imports   american cars are just as if not more reliable than most imports plus you get style and great driving experience   plus it would survive a wreck better most my   stang is the most awesome car to drive that i have ever owned and it only cost me      with leather plus    in add ons   about half the price of most comparably powered imports   i am not blind to the negatives though   engine a bit noisey at higher rpm s but when blended with the rumble from   quot   dual exhaust it s just fine   probably should get upgrade to   quot   or   quot   wheels from the v stock   quot   but not really necessary   i love the   speed and with it it weighs   lbs less than a gt with automatic and   lbs lighter than a v camaro with nearly the same hp   gt s feel heavier and i know they would be awesome to own    and to upgrade    but for    less money i ll stick with my nimble v and have fun upgrading it here and there   supercharger   who knows   maybe someday br br  
1097,1,  in march of   i drove from ontario canada down the i   to fort lauderdale florida to purchase my   v   laser red convertible   i am in no way a fanatic   in fact i know very little about mustangs   i do know enough about mustangs that i love all of the retro touches on the new body style   when you put my   beside an old   you can easily see the inspiration for the design   i made the long drive to find a perfect and rust free used convertible and the car is worth every mile of my trip   my laser red is an auto with beige leather and power everything with a beige top   every time i drive this car i find myself appreciating it a little more   the v   has plenty of power for any kind of legal driving and will still pull hard out of the corners   the   wheel disc brakes are smooth and powerful   the power top works great and is quick enough to put up at a red light   although it does leak a bit in a heavy rain   i guess that s just part of owning a convertible   i put this car away for the winter   so i can t comment on winter traction but in the summer the stock goodyears do an excellent job the v   does lack the deep growl of the v   and the rear end looks much better with the dual exhaust   a new exhaust may be comming next season   the little    rims and tires bother me a bit on my v    there is too much room between the wheels and the fenders   it looks like a x   next up after the dual exhaust will be to find a good set of used    gt rims and have the suspension lowered   which is an inexpensive job   my wife and i have a   year old and the car seat fits nicely in the back   my daughter loves the convertible and begs to have the top down   i put her in after i put the top down   and i find it easier to lift her in than putting her into out   door truck   the back seat is really only suited for kids or a duffle bag having said all that   there really is no other feeling like driving the classic american muscle car with the sun and the wind   i would never have considered this car as a hard top   if you re going to put up with all the inconveniences of a tiny sports car   it had better reward you with the top down experience  
1098,1,  i walked into the dealer near my house and saw this beauty   it was a gt   red with black racing stripes on the hood and leather interior   i thought to myself for about   seconds then made a decision that i must have this car   its absolutely beautiful and its an experience to drive each and everytime i get behind the wheel   everyone stares at it and not to be a materialistic but it feels good to have something that people admire   it has a    liter engine v and it s power is unbelievable   i had other sports cares but this one tops all of them in the area of comfort   i absolutely adore this vehicle and recommend it to anyone with class and a desire for excitement and a little fast paced fun   the only bad thing is the gas   but i m willing to overlook that negative quality and again i will say you only live once so have fun and take chances br br  
1099,1,  to me   this is what was originally supposed to be about a fun to drive car   comfortable on longer trips   available with a peppy engine that gets reasonable gas mileage   i have the   hp six cylinder this car is nice and stable at high freeway speeds   feels heavy and solid on the road   handles well   and seems so aerodynamic   i love mine laser red   automatic    wheel abs   good sound system   standard   nice cloth seats   i like a sports car that is still attainable to most of us   that is still in the average american budget plus   this car is back to what the was all about too many of our american cars became bloated machines that were nothing like the originals both the and the thunderbird come to mind   i love both of these cars though i can t see myself absolutely giving up the rear seat   as in the thunderbird for    i love the   my own personal car for zipping around   with a usable rear seat   nobody said how usable   but usable br br  
1100,1,  for years prior to actually getting a drivers license   i have adored the classic    convertible   how could i refuse to love those curves   that massive design   that glistening red paint   and that spacious   leather interior   it was the car of my dreams   from the moment i fist lay eyes on it   yes   i admit it   i was one of the many victims suffering from madness   i vowed that i would buy that classic car and have it rebuilt and restored as soon as i could drive as the years went by   and produced a new after that failed to inspire me   i remained true to the classic    model and i counted the days until i could have one   now that the time to buy a car has rolled around   comes out with a stunning new look to the old classic   this brand new classic in the making has the fine contour or a machine built for speed   instead of the luxurious comfort of the    version   when the brand new first caught my eye   i knew i was in trouble   how could i stay true to the classic when this red   convertible   speed demon had hold of me   one look at this beautiful piece of american car and i   like many people   was hooked has finally redesigned the to do the classic justice   even though it was difficult to push the classic aside   i am thrilled to see that the is back with a vengeance     
1101,1,  are you contemplating the   i know i know   it is a   but   if you can get past that you won t be sorry the only model i can write about is the gt convertible   loaded   in my never humble opinion it is the only way to go   now we will assume that you are   a over the age of twenty five and   b under the age of fifty   otherwise your insurance bill will exceed sadam hussein s hooker tab or you are too old to be seen in such a i hope i don t look too old kind of car this car is not cheap but it does move   it is not a stealthy car   can you say highway patrol trooper but chics like   em   it doesn t get thirty miles to the gallon but the fuel tank holds plenty   you won t want to drive on go out with your buds night but for just you or one companion it can t be beat there is no equal for this car in speed and handling for the money   and you may even find that the famous reputation for unreliable poorly screwed together vehicles does not apply to the   and   by the way   this is by no means a limited production car   they build a zillion of them so you can strike a hard bargain     
1102,1,  i pull up to the stop light and next to me i see a porsche boxster   but you see if i were in any other car i would sit back and stare in awe but i was in my brand new   gt   this guy in the porsche was over there thinkin look at this guy thinking he s got a fast car   well i m going to burn him   but when the light turned green i was gone before he could say a word   i love my   i have loved mustangs since they came out   they have always been reliable cars and so far my   has proved to be reliable also   the is one of the sharpest   sleekest   best lookin cars on the road today   the style and performance is unbeatable for the price   if you are lookin for bang for the buck then this is the car for you   i got this car because i wanted a fun reliable car to drive around everyday   i got both out of the   if you are single and want a good car for good money the is for you br br  
1103,1,  the new   gt is an awesome car   i own the car in performance red the new color for the   model year   the car is everything a person could want   it has a nice    liter v engine with   horsepower   the    in this beast is in the low   s   the only thing i don t like about the car is the back seat   but since i am the owner of the vehicle i don t sit back there   the space in the back is kind of small but it can still fit   comfortably   the thing i like about this car is all the looks that you get in it   it s awesome   also if you are a big car fanatic like myself then there are so many different things that you can do to your car to make it different than others   a new option also on the   and   models is traction control which really does help   i have noticed a tremendous difference which its on   the options i got on my car was a   gt   leather interior    speed manual   and other options   i just recently purchased the car and i love it   i paid just under     for it   overall experience with the car is i am    satisfied   i recommend this car to someone that loves cars br br  
1104,1,  i ve read all of the other reviews posted for the   expedition and i m amazed that most of the reviewers don t even own one   yet are compelled to write reviews that are nothing more than retyped spec sheets from take it from an actual owner    this is a great vehicle to drive   i have an eddie bauer wd version that i bought new in january    it is so much fun to drive   i actually find myself looking for extra trips to make to the store just to drive it i ve had all the seats full of people   seats   comfortably and i ve had it filled with lumber and other cargo   either way   it s   l triton v pulls it easily   in may   i used the tow hooks on the front to pull my brother s suv   olds bravada   out of a swampy mess   let me also tell you that at that time   his bravada also had a    pontoon boat and trailer hitched up to it   it was up to it s axles in mud   yet the expedition gracefully pulled it right out   without even breathing heavy at all   i then towed the boat about   miles over hilly country roads and often forgot that the boat was even there because it handled it so effortlessly now   i don t plan on using it like that too often   but it was nice to know that it could handle it   my main objective with this vehicle to have comfortable seating for several passengers   i need more passenger room than i could get with smaller suv s   so i only considered the expedition and the yukon tahoe   i love gm products   but the expedition costs about   k less when similarly equipped   to those who suggest getting a mini van   i can only suggest that you quit making suggestions   this suv   even if it never touches the off road environment   is the classiest and most comfortable way to travel   the added confidence of wd for winter driving makes any mini van just a glorified station wagon that is best suited for picking up groceries if you re reading this   you re probably already aware of the spec s for the expedition so i won t retype them   what i will point out to you is that the eddie bauer is the only way to go   for about   k more than an xlt   you get the   l engine   leather interior   seat warmers   mach audio system   digital temperature control   exterior trim package   very nice   and lot s more   i got mine with    chrome wheels and i have to say it s the only way to go one extra that was included on mine was the reverse sensing warning system   a    option   but worth lot s more   it has saved me on a couple of occasions by warning of obstructions behind me   and is a great companion for when i back the truck into the garage   yes   it just barely fits in my garage   i can easily back in and pull within   inches of the wall every time   just by listening to the beeping tones of the warning system   make sure you get this option i m getting    mpg on a combined hwy city style of driving   not so great on the wallet   but that is what you have to pay if you want a big suv   it s no worse than any other large suv   and the other issue about insurance costs    well   it s true that you ll be safe in an accident   but whatever you hit will likely be destroyed   but   isn t that the way you would want it   i know that i want my wife and new baby to be safe in case of an accident   so if it means an extra    for insurance   so be it   your insurance costs are a direct reflection of your driving skills   so all of those reviewers that talk about high insurance costs must have some amazingly poor driving records   of course it s going to cost them more if they re a bad driver behind the wheel of a bulldozer suv like the expedition   after you ve driven it for a week or two   you ll find that it s not very intimidating to drive after all   and the turning radius is really quite surprising to conclude   i will say that i love this suv and will not part with it   take it from someone who actually owns one   and disregard all those pulitzer wannabees out there that have nothing better to do than write reviews about vehicles that they don t own   for    has added a new suspension that allows for the third seat to fold down flat   which is the only thing that i would love to change about my    it would be so nice to be able to fold it s third seat out of the way instead of having to remove it and stash it in the garage before running to home depot i hope this review was helpful to you  
1105,1,  let me explain to you in detail what i have before i review the car   i own a silver    l ho gt   i bought the car used and i am the third owner of the car   the car has been taken care of really well   which enables me to make an accurate review of the car itself   the engine is a stock   l ho engine with the exception of new headers and under drive pulleys   the radiator has been replaced with a   core radiator   the suspension has been modified with adjustable shock   you can adjust how smooth or tight you want it to ride   my review is with the setting to     being the middle   the settings are     for smooth ride and     for tight ride   the radio has been replaced with a jvc cd deck along with a trunk mounted   disc cd changer   the exhausts have been replaced by steeda with high flow exhausts but are not the straight pipe ones you ve all seen on the road   these on the outside look like the standard ones which almost hide underneath the bumper   they are called steeda   whisper   exhausts for reference purposes ok   first of all   let me address the so called   whisper   exhausts   let me tell you that i am completely clueless on why they call them that   the car is in no way quiet   instead it sounds like pure muscle   not like i m complaining   it s a beautiful sound anyway   on with the car   the car comes standard with a   l ho v   which i must say is a fine piece of machinery   even though compared to today s   l v which puts out hp   the   l s hp might seem very modest   however   don t disregard it just yet   the   l engine gives out more than enough power on a wider range than a lot of cars i ve driven i will explain what i mean by this   but first i want to clear something up about engines and power   when they give you a horsepower rating   they should give a corresponding rpm number   this is the revolutions per second the engine is turning   the reason for this is that depending on how fast the engine is turning   the number of horsepower is different   obviously the higher the rpm the higher the horsepower   however   with some cars that advertise a great amount of horsepower or a great amount of torque   they usually mean at an extremely high rpm   such as   or above   this horsepower is almost useless in initial acceleration   most japanese small engine cars that try to advertise ridiculous horsepower numbers use this technique   read into it further and you ll find that it ll be at those extremely high rpms which is close to redline and can damage the engine if brought to it enough   the main problem with this is that most of the horsepower and torque won t kick in until the engine is spinning so fast   so basically anywhere before that you won t feel barely anything the engine in the   however   is different   i ve found that i m stuck to my seat from the very beginning all the way up to mph or more   i did this little test one day on an empty turnpike   the speed limit was mph   so when i stopped to pay the toll   i floored it coming out of the toll plaza   the car returned excellent response all the way up to mph   this means the car has a really good midrange   which is the best to have the interior looks fairly nice   the instrument panel is fairly well arranged and i like the inclusion of an oil level gauge   most cars have this by now   but like the car i had before   a   acura integra   some cars didn t   some things i don t like about the interior is the plastic   a lot of the dash is plastic   and that bothers me   it s so cheap feeling   however it isn t especially cheap or nasty looking   so that s not too bad   but i would prefer at least vinyl   there is some vinyl though   the middle storage box is very small   and doesn t really hold much   mainly just a pair of sunglasses and the little remote for my cd player   also it is positioned too far back   you have to bend your wrist a lot to reach the button and to flip it open   then you d have to look down and back to see what s inside to know what to get   also   i don t like how the trunk release button is located inside the glove compartment on the positive note   there are enough good things about the features to let you overlook some of the slight annoyances of the interior   after   airbags were required as standard   so the   obviously has one   which is a little reassuring after driving the   acura without an airbag for so long   also   it has power windows   power locks   power steering   power brakes   cruise control   everything   and also everything works   as long as it has been maintained   everything should still work even after   years mine is an automatic transmission car   it has all the standard settings but unlike the japanese cars have the overdrive feature too   i kind of hoped they would switch the placement of the overdrive with the regular drive   the way they have it configured now is   from top to bottom   park   reverse   neutral   overdrive   drive   st gear   i m used to simply counting the number of notches when going from setting to setting   i m used to one notch down for reverse   then two more notches down to get into drive   now i have to go three   that s not too horrible of a problem   but the fact is   regular drive would be used more   so it should come first   the way it is now   is that when i m in drive   the two most likely settings for the shift to accidentally get knocked into is overdrive and st gear   slipping into overdrive while driving is no big deal   but if i would accidentally knock it to st gear i can probably majorly damage the transmission   especially if i m driving fast   which isn t hard to do in this car   another thing that i don t like about the shifter is that there is no display on the dash what setting you re in   i liked it when i can see on the instrument panel what i m in instead of having to look down if ever i m unsure   however   these are easily overlooked   they are just the little annoyances i ve noticed the automatic transmission works pretty efficiently   in regular drive   you ll be able to feel the car very accurately   the transmission   like all other automatics   would   kickdown   a gear when it senses the gas pedal is depressed harder or more   the only thing is that at the higher gears   it tends to not want to kickdown unless i really step on the gas   however with this kickdown at the higher gears is not really required to get decent acceleration   but it s there if you really need it on overdrive   it drives identical to the regular drive on all speeds under about   mph   after that point   it will go into overdrive   in overdrive you ll notice that the car will have very little acceleration response   this is because it is trying to be more fuel efficient   despite the lack of acceleration response   this setting is really nice on long trips   since at overdrive it accomplishes mph with only rpms from the engine   which is down right incredible   normally in my acura integra the engine will be spinning at about rpms to get up to mph   this big ho engine gives almost no effort at mph   that is especially good not only for gas mileage but for the life of the engine   the more stress the engine is put through the shorter the life will be   with the   l ho engine you don t need to worry about that since it requires little effort to get the same speeds accomplished by japanese sports cars i really don t have to speak of the exterior   anyone who sees my car immediately compliments me on how beautiful it is   some people might not appreciate it as much   but in good condition it just simply looks good   the front has very bold designing with the large hood area and the flat   mean looking front including the awesome looking round fog lamps on the bottom from the side you notice the ground effects the most   most people have mistakenly thought that i put a body kit on the car   they don t realize the car needs no body kit   it looks that good stock from   the car is sitting on aluminum alloy    rims   which for that year is the newly designed   point star design in opposed to the   and before   turbine   style    wheels the rear of the car is a hatchback design   this is where most of the complaints lie   i say most   but that s out of very few total complaints   you generally don t hear very many negative points on the gt s body design   the rear of the car is quite small   the rear wheels are almost sitting at the corners   however they executed it quite well   one of the first things you notice about the back is the big spoiler rear wing   this   unlike the ones you see on japanese cars teenagers customize   is a functioning rear wing   it directs some of the air flow up and outward to put slightly more pressure on the rear wheels at high speed to maintain grip and to provide better grip on the rear wheels during braking   on rear wheel drive vehicles   you will definitely need this that is why tire manuals would instruct for the new tires to be placed on the back wheels despite what most people think   even if it is a front wheel drive car   the reason for this being   the last thing you want is to lose grip on the rear wheels   if you ever lose traction of the rear wheels your back end would get lose and you ll probably go into a spin the brake lights   indicators   and reverse indicators are all packaged together in a group covered by a grill like design so the light goes through in many tiny slots   it s hard to explain   but it is very attractive   and like the body kit mistake   a lot of people mistaken this as a custom thing done to the rear light   but this is the way the car comes stock from the sound of the car is also excellent   i ve heard   l mustangs with the standard exhausts and they sound decent   but the real magic of the   l engine is best expressed with hi flow exhausts such as the steeda exhausts or the ever popular flowmaster exhausts   the sound of the   l ho engine is actually really distinct   a trained ear can easily tell a from other sports cars even ones with similar sized engines   it is not that annoying weed whacker sound you hear from the big exhaust tips   or   cherry bombs   you see so much of these day   instead you can hear the rumble of the engine and the separation between the firing of different pistons   and it s a great sound   reminds you of the muscle car age back in the   s and   s all in all   it is really unlikely to find such a great combination of all features for such a great price   the car combines all out muscle with some nice features to be more practical   the ride comfort is not at the level of being a luxury car   not at all   it feels really distinctly like a sports car   but at the same time does not discomfort you while doing so   the car is a little annoying to get over speed bumps due to how low the car is   and there is the occasional squeak you ll hear when going over a bumpy road   but otherwise the sheer excitement of driving such a car will make you forget all of that   all of the extra comfort features are also very welcome in this sports car as well   cold ac   power everything   cruise control   and hey   it even has a back seat for your friends   although not really big and roomy   is similar to the integra i had before   so no big complaint there   if you can find one in good condition   don t hesitate to buy this car   make sure to get it checked out at a mechanic s first because it has been   years   a lot can have happened to it   but if maintained well   this can give you years of excitement   and compliments b update      b   well   it s a bit more than   months since buying this car   so this is an update on my opinion on the car based on more experience   and i must say i will still back up everything i ve said and much much more   it has met all my expectations and more   first of all   i scrounged through the receipts from steeda and i found that the previous owner had installed steeda sport springs which effectively lower the car and the center of gravity   that would explain why i scrape the bottom of my car everytime i go over a speed bump   and i go really slow too   well since buying it i ve had to give the car a major tune up   replacing such parts as all the spark plugs   spark plug wires   distributor cap   water pump   serpentine belt   and the fan clutch   this might seem like a huge list of parts   but most of it besides the waterpump and fan clutch is part of the tune up and other preventive maintenance   the thing that really stands out is the costs   for my old car   the acura integra   a new distributor cap would have run as high as     on the   the brand new distributor cap was    and change   this was basically the case with everything else   to get the waterpump and serpentine belt replaced was less than    total including parts   labor   and tax   if i was to get either the drive belt or timing belt and the waterpump replaced in the acura integra i would have been looking at a good    or more job   so owning a popular american car has really saved me a lot of money   cars like the chevy camaro and the are so common and simple that there are a huge array of aftermarket retailers that deal in parts and upgrades for them   thus   extremely low costs also   i can not really make mention of anything illegal such as street racing   so i ll have to say   i haven t been involved in any illegal street racing   however   you and i both know that when you own a   you re going to get challenged at the stop light   it s inevitable   by every rice boy in town   and eh hem   i can t say i ve officially raced them   but i can say   unofficially   that i ve never yet   lost    hint    hint    so speed lovers out there   this is definitely one of the more rewarding cars to buy on the market  
1106,1,   the paparazzi   they re always causin   problems b much press has been given to the newly styled    gt   and   svt cobra    both good and bad   we were originally attracted to the gt for its power and speed   but had never considered purchasing one until the   model year    the new styling   with it s crisper lines and more powerful engine were all we needed to fall in love with not just one but two ponycars   as the proud owners of both a   gt and   cobra we tend to disagree with much of the negative attention surrounding the cobra and the rumored    performance inadequacies i b let s clear up a few misconceptions b for starters   these problems did not plague all   svt s   elected to perform these   horsepower upgrades   on a voluntary basis   as a response to some dissatisfied svt owners   fortunately   some cobras managed to come off the lot in prime condition    and with the upgrades to the fuel chip   intake and exhaust system   wow   while my gt boasts a respectable hp   and even though it s equipped with an automatic transmission   can easily hit the   mark in the advertised time   it pales in comparison to the gut wrenching power and sheer g force put out by the cobra   even prior to the upgrade   the cobra was on par with both the corvette and camaro ss   although the advertised    times on these are slightly lower than that of the cobra   our cobra was even fortunate enough to leave in it s wake a highly supercharged supra equipped with nitrous b clutch in   let up on the or was it b driving the cobra requires a complete re education in shifting and cornering   most day to day driving will find you in rd or th gear   reserving th for only the highest of freeway speeds   you will immediately feel its power as you squeal off the line in first gear   but even more impressive is the monstrous pull of   second   gear   and this is where you will gain your greatest acceleration   third is nearly as powerful   and quite often you may find that you   bark   the tires when speedshifting from nd to rd   drivers may at first be startled by the subtle lift of the front end of the car when accelerating suddenly b how ya like my   curves i b the handling and suspension are sheer perfection   the independent rear suspension allows you to take ramps   hills and curves at full speed with no lean or instability    no turn is too sharp for this snake   shifting is crisp and quick   and with each successive gear   you ll feel all   of those horses just bucking to be set free   we had been advised that it would be possible to lower the suspension up to   inches   but have found this will not be necessary    the slightly higher stance gives the driver an excellent command of the road without sacrificing handling capabilities in the least b fits you like a glove b the front seats are form fitting and highly supportive   even on long roadtrips   and front seat passengers can enjoy oodles of legroom   backseats are comfortable   however rear legroom is limited   but let s face it    this is a sports car   not a minivan   the mach   soundsystem produces excellent   clear sound   though you may want to crank it in order to hear it over the roar of the v    the cobra and the gt are pure driving enjoyment   both in daily traffic and on weekend excursions   the slightly crowded backseat and limited trunkspace are hardly worth mentioning when compared to the overall perfection of these performance machines b author s note   beware of lot lizards b one thing to keep in mind when purchasing a cobra is that due to the limited release   only    per model year will be produced   some dealerships will try to impose a surcharge of over      don t pay it   when the first dealership tried to sell us this car at close to      we walked   they attempted to convince us that it was   not the dealership   that was imposing this fee    they called it a   limited release surcharge   upon investigation   we found that another local dealer also had one cobra on it s lot   and they were in fact not overcharging   so stand your ground and don t let them fool you   a fully equipped cobra hardtop should run you in the neighborhood of      b the final word b last but not least   there is one positive result of all of the negative press surrounding the performance    you will find that other drivers   particularly those in other sports cars   may underestimate the power of your car   just be sure to wave and smile as you leave them behind b author s addendum   september      our cobra is a    and despite what some people think   there   were   no   cobras   this has made the   s even more sought after   at least down here in florida   where it seems there are more mustangs per capita than anywhere else in the u s   some dealers still have a few left on the lot   and i ve seen price gouging even worse than   months ago when we purchased ours   but if you can get your hands on one   i d highly recommend it br br  
1107,1,  prior to my new   i had bought the   model which was a new body design as with my current purchase   both times i was extremely pleased with my purchase   its always nice to get looks and compliments from strangers   especially when its a new body design   it just grabs attention   i bought the   v   there is no major changes to the year   model   but compared to the previous years   model   the power is finally a long awaited   welcome to the new body desing   it was getting embarassing driving beside the vw golfs   jetta   passats in their v engines   not to mention the hondas   acuras   or the gm s and their peppy engines   for an american   quot muscle car quot   how could you have only put   hp on the v engine    but now   with   hp on the v   you get the respect that was long overdue   but don t use the regular unleaded gas   you get nothing like the power it should have when you use the premium   base models are packed with features that most people want   power driver seat   air cond and power windows   abs is an option   but i would strongly recommend it for this car   it sucks in the rain   and not that much better in the snow   but still   one of my favorites cause it is still rear wheel drive   dual cup holders that actually hold the larger fast food cup sizes now   well   large lit displays with easy to reach controls   i bought the model with the mach sound system which is supposedly made by jbl it is sweet sounding and has a pretty hard punch to its bass   ride is quiet   smooth for a sports car   and the engine exhaust sounds throaty unlike previous years when it sound winey and wimpy   still   it can be improved to give the growl   even if it is only a v    quot   tires are too narrow   have to upgrade to at least   quot   gas milage is a concern   it has gone down from my    i spend about    for   miles and that usually lasts me about   days only    as with my    i ve had to do nothing but oil changes so far   for the price   it is still one of the best buys on the market   there are so many toys as well for this model   body kits   computer chips to boost hp   exhaust kits   etc   i bought the   th anniversary edition and showed some class by sending me a th anniversary kit that included a book of the s history   stickers and some other tidbits a few negative things i noticed so far is that in my automatic transmission   after coming to a stop   the transmission shifts back to st and you can feel a push jolt   so make sure you have your foot on the brake tight when you are at stop lights   also   driver s seat belt locks up sometimes and straps you in to tight   the trunk height is useless   can t even fit a large suitcase in their   may be deep but height is a real problem   why can t the make the trunk deeper like in european or japanese models   br br  
1108,1,  well lets see   the   it goes way back in history as a muscle car of the   s and   s but still goes on today   i have never had the thrill of owning a and probably never will   but my feelings will never change back in the early   s there were many types of mustangs   coupe   convertable   fastback   gt   boss   ex   now in the   s and in yk   there is nt as many versions of the   you have the cobra   coupe   conv   and boss   you have to special order the real sportsters   they only market on the showroom floor the convertable and coupe   why not let us see them all for a change   the major thing i like about the new the   model and   is that they have increased the horsepower up to hp   do nt sound like much but you get into a v and it feels like you are in a gt   no lie   i once testdrove a gt and a v   the power of a v was unreal and i really got excited as they put the extra umph   i really like the older style   but with the way the world goes everything must change   some for the better and some for the worst   i would surely buy a if i was able to and really needed a sport car   but for the hot rod at heart its the sure choice br br  
1109,1,  my first car was a      cu in automatic with turn signals on the hood and a black vinyl roof over yellow paint job   today this car would be the ultimate classic ride   now in the nineties   i have owned three new s         and i believe that is on the right track to making me as happy as the first one   the body style of the   s is quite a bit different from the other two   with a rounder body and square like head   amp   tail lights this is more like a toyota body style if i had a dollar for every person that told me    quot i love your car quot   or   quot cool car   man quot   it probably would be enough to make one of the payments   all three of these vehicles were five speed transmission s because i just love to drive   living out in the hill country of texas   not far from ih   it is easy to get down the road and make it to one of the big cities   never had a bit of trouble with any of these vehicles and i easily put   to   thousand miles a year on the first two   with the machi cd stereo system the road becomes a joy to own   the   was not a gt and the difference is quite noticeable during acceleration   i would recommend the   liter over the   liter engine if you do a lot of highway driving   one thing you may have to get used to is other   quot sporty quot   cars pulling alongside and begging you to have a race   this takes a little getting used to especially when most of the time it would be no problem to blow their doors off   take a walk on the wild side with a new also sent me a fantastic gift package containing a three cd set of music from the   s    s   amp    s and a wonderful black leather cd case as well as a hard cover edition of the   quot history of quot   try and beat this deal br br  
1110,1,  this card provides a strong handling of the road and can work for the driver but if regular maintenance isn t maintained on this automobile it falls apart   this car takes constant care and is an asset to the buyer based on the look but can easily become a pocket drain   when you first get this car generally sends a package that is very impressive   books and or memorabilia but remember this costs money and the gets it from the price of the car   so decide if you want to pay for the looks and repairs   i have enjoyed the car but not the maintenance     
1111,1,  i recently purchased a new and have nothing but good things to say about it   i had spent a lot of time looking at cars and doing research into what car i wanted   i had owned a camaro before   and said i never wanted to have a   well   as i drove by the dealership   the just jumped out at me   something about that car really caught my attention   and why shouldn t it have   there are many perks to this car   first off   the is a legacy anyway   this car has a lot of history   also   i really like what they have done with this new body style   as soon as i got in the car to test drive it   i knew it was the car for me   it has great power   good handling   good stereo system   and i like the inside a lot better than the camaro   not to mention   the price tag on it was very pleasing   too   after all the nonsense at the dealership   i ended up driving off the lot at around     got ta give two thumbs up to on this beauty br br  
1112,1,  in my opinion one of the better cars of   would be the   the new model contains a numerous amount of good characteristics   which   in my opinion   outweigh the seldom found negative qualities   the   was given a change in body style from the previous year   which most people find very appealing   this car is ideal for any sports car lover on a tight budget   the new engine placed in the   model gets   more horsepower than the previous year   which gives the v model a greater    than either of its leading competitors   the pontiac firebird or the camaro   the even comes with more than average room in the front seats for sports cars   i myself am    quot   and in no way am i lacking in room   on the down side   like most sports cars who even have four seats   one would have to be around the age of ten to actually be comfortable in the rear seats of the car   the only negative comment that comes to my mind in my reflection of the year i have owned my is the relative easiness to lose traction on even semi wet roads   however   the optional traction control system for around    works great by quickly restoring traction to the vehicle after it begins to slip   the traction control system even comes equipped with an on off switch for those moments where a driver really wants to peel out at a stoplight   and show everyone around him that the is truly a great car br br  
1113,1,  the new gt convertible is a very good car overall   it has great looks   great handling and an aggressive powerful feel   i personally give the car a   out of a    there are a few things i don t like though   they are    there is a lot of road noise and wind noise with the convertible   although the horse power has been increased i still feel that the    is a better   auto transmission in the    feels kind of sluggish   it feels like it takes too long for it to accept the power from the engine to drive the wheels   i kick myself for getting an automatic every day   if your going to get one go with the   speed it feels much more powerful   also the back seat is mostly useless to any adult   only kids or small adults can be comfortable in the back   don t get me wrong i love the car and if i had to do it again i would buy the car again but this time i would get the   speed br br  
1114,1,  the new refined   quot gt quot   has its ups and downs   this car is very sleek and stylish with its redesigned interior and exterior   this car comes with a    liter v   that hd torque and agility of an american sports car   the old    engine is missed because of its horespower and awsome sound but this new engine is doing real good for its smaller size   i like this car so much because its good looking and it drives like no other   i think it corners the best out of anything i ve drivin   i also liked the manual transmission feel   i feel in control of the car at high speeds and low   the cost of this car is fairly reasonable for a car like this but kinda hard on the checkbook   the back seat is one of the downs because its too small for an adult to ride in its built for a smaller kid     
1115,1,  the    has got to be the most affordable sports car in it class   averaging between     and     for the basic    speed   fully equipped model will outbeat any of it competition   just the sound of the engine in the   speed when putting your foot on the gas will take your breath away i am only   years old   basically just getting my feet off the ground and always wanted my first new car to be a sports   and the my that wish come true with it price and incentive programs   at any age   if you enjoy going fast and feeling power behind the wheel of your automobile when you put your foot on the gas   this car is for you only downfall to this car   as well as all sports cars   is the lack of ability to drive it in the rain and snow without fear of losing control because of the rear wheel drive and lack of weight in the trunk area br br  
1116,1,  for   made many improvements to the gt   more ponies   more leg room and a body redesign   the   gt does what the has always done   a good sports car at a good price   this doesn t handle like a corvette but it s less then half the price   for the price this is probably the best deal for your money i ve had this up to top speed    mph on the speedo   it ran as smooth as can be   if any law enforcement personnel are reading this i did this test on the track as far as you know the car handles very good in the corners   the back end is a little light though   the back end wants to swing out when you turn fast and hard   but what i m talking about here is very extreme cornering   normal sports car corners are no problem   one problem   this car is like a cat   it hates water   drive on wet pavement carefully or the you ll be spinning like a disco ball br br  
1117,1,  i have an electric green   and i love it   it is my first car and it is a great first car   at first   not being comfortable with driving got me worried about having a sports car   but it handles great and rides as smooth as anything   i love everything about it especially the color   because it is different   it handles great   gets great gas milage   easy to drive   i would reccomend it to anyone that wants a reliable   fun and easy driving vehicle   the only fault that i can say about this car is that it is not a family car   it is good for one or two people   but if you have kids   it is probabaly not the best choice   but besides that i love it   and it is very comfortable in the front br br  
1118,1,  i bought my   escort gt over three years ago   it had a little under    miles on it   which was less than it should have i bought it because it fit my budget   but was still sporty   after living with this car   i can recommend it to other buyers the body   interior   engine   and transmission of my car are all in excellent condition   for their age   the only major mechanical problem i had was when the timing belt snapped   but that should have been replaced at    miles   which it wasn t as far as driving   it is a very pleasant vehicle   relatively quiet   very secure and stable   i have a manual transmission   and the engine revs through the power band eagerly   redline is at    which allows a quick launch   and an impressive sprint to    torque steer can be felt   particularly during hard acceleration or turning   but it isn t unreasonable   the available power is plentiful   and the car   coupled with a manual   really does return a satisfying driving experience the interior ergonomics are good   with the placement of the air conditioning and stereo within arm s reach   each door features storage compartments   as well as the large glove box   since this is a coupe   entry to the back seat can be difficult for adults the hatchback allows an ample amount of space for groceries   luggage   even large items   with the seats folded down   i ve been able to transport   quot   televisions   as well as an assortment of other things   all at the same time two sore spots for my particular car have been the brakes   and an odd electrical problem that causes the car to stall   i ve replaced three out of four brake calipers   and have had no success in tracking down the electrical problem   another thing a potential buyer should be aware of   the gt model of this car has the underpinnings of a mazda protege   furthermore   replacement parts for this car commonly come from a mazda dealership   or an independent foreign auto parts supplier   the powerplant is all mazda electronics   including the starter   another replacement i have made   overall   i didn t expect the phenomenal reliability my particular car has afforded me   besides the infrequent electrical problem   the car has rarely had any mechanical problems   as with all used cars   do a thorough inspection of all fascets of the automobile before purchasing it   and i suspect you will find a reliable   cheap   economical   yet fun automobile br br  
1119,1,  i have owned a   t bird    mercury cougar and now a   t bird   these are all essentially the same cars   given differences for model years   these cars are virtually indestructible for american manufactured autos   the    went k miles   the    was at k miles when they were sold and the    is at k miles   i had no major breakdowns on any of these and i was always impressed that when they were emissions tested   required in most states   even at high mileage   each tested well within the clean air standards   this indicates a well built   close tolerance engine   designed to last   alas they are not made anymore   realized they could make and sell a taurus mercury sable   a smaller car and less costly to produce and sell it for more profit than they ever saw on the t birds or cougars   or you are forced to buy an even pricier crown victoria or mercury grand marquis if you like larger and safer auto   these were spiffy road cruisers with good looks   good gas mileage   and performed well for their size   if you can find a low mileage     they make a great second or even your main vehicle   these will no doubt be collector items for your children  
1120,1,  we chose this truck because it was an upgrade of our previous   you can tell we are   quot people quot   we wanted a dependable truck which would out live the loan payments   seven years and    miles later   it looks and drives as good as any of the newer models on the busy city streets and long texas highways   the body shows no signs of deterioration and the engine still purrs little a kitten   it was bought without the automatic windows and doors for longevity   this was the correct choice since many of the automatic windows and doors fail long before seven years   we have had no major defects other than an oil pan leak caused by a bad gasket which proved to be costly since it required the removal of the transmission to get to the gasket to be replaced   another short coming was the windshield wipers which were under designed   too small   for the truck which leaves areas of the windows which are not cleaned properly we intend to keep this truck for another three to four years or    miles which it will have no problem reaching   then we will most likely choose another f or upgrade to one of those three door cabs   this vehicle is not for everyone   people who are under   feet tall   over   years of age should not buy this truck unless they have a step stool   if you are looking for a truck that is dependable   low maintenance and fits in your budget   try it you will like it     
1121,1,  if you ask most people about a taurus   their either going to tell you that they loved it or hated it   you re going to get a mixed response from me   if you are looking for a short term or lease vehicle   then this car is for you   if you are looking for a good   reliable long term car    years or more   then this is not the car for you   my in laws bought this car brand new at the end of a model year    they bought it having only   miles on it in january    my husband acquired the car from his parents in january    we had the car until we traded it in december    overall   it was a good car   there were some major repairs that had to be done    for example   a new head gasket costing around k   however   on most of the major repairs did eventually recall the vehicle for that particular item   by recall   i mean that they refunded your money if you had already done the repair or repaired it for free if you hadn t   i d say that recalled this car for about   different problems   the good point   is that they did recall it when they found a consistent problem the problem for us came in december   when the car had k miles   all at once   everything went wrong with the car   it needed a new air conditioner   new mounts   and new heat core among other things   the total for the repairs came to over      needless to say   we were not going to put this kind of work into an old car   that s when we decided to trade it in   my in laws   amp   my family still buy the taurus   they have found the same thing that we have time   amp   again   the car is great for the st    years   until we had these problems   the car was a very good   reliable car   the seats are very comfortable even on long road trips   we should know   we took many   many trips in that car   we will buy a still    we have one now   we have learned from experience   though   when we re looking for a nice sized but affordable short term car   we will get a taurus   if we re looking for a long term car that will be with us   years from now   we ll shop in another direction     
1122,1,  i was riding with my father in his taurus station wagon today to get some matierals for the construction workers that are remodeling our home   while in the car i thought it might be interesting to compare his car to my bmw   series   a review of my car can be read at   a href auto review ea dafef aa prod epinions auto review ea dafef aa prod a   some interesting facts i noticed was that the taurus actually seems to accelerate smoother   and brake smoother than the bmw   although the bmw does accelerate faster   the seat comfort up front is comfortable in both cars   however i personally like the back seat more in the bmw   since it has head rests   and the seats are contoured for the body   for people with families that travel often and need room for luggage   such as my family   i would recommend the taurus   for those who like to have luxuries   even to the point of having a weather station built into a car   i would recommend the bmw   the taurus is also a smooth car   as is the bmw   the is cheaper to get fixed   although it seems that it often does need fixing   usually nothing major   a recent fix was the air conditioning   which cost over    to fix   one feature that seems to be taken for granted in a lot of cars is the cup holder   the bmw does not even have one   although the does   in the bmw i use the area on the door to place the cups   although it seems it was made for cassettes or cd s to be placed there   another advantage of the is that it is very good on gas   it gets probably about   mpg more than the bmw   when the bmw was purchased a gas guzzler tax needed to be paid   i like the taurus station wagon and would recommend it for families br br  
1123,1,  ever went to purchase a vehicle and you wanted a family car and your spouse wanted a truck   well has done it   it is the explorer sport trac   it is a combination of both   there is enough room inside for a family but then has a bed like a truck   once we test drove this we knew that we had to have it   so that s what happened   we got us one   this has been one of the best vehicles that we have ever purchased   besides being a combination car and truck it has many more unique qualities   have you ever had to move and were worried about scratching or denting the bed of your truck   well your worries are over   this truck has a guaranteed bed   it will never ding   dent or rust   trust me it sounds like a gimmick   but i have tested it and know that it is all the truth   we recently helped family move and my husband had a tow bar in the bed   this thing was sliding all around   every time that we slammed on the brakes it would hit the back of the bed and i thought there is no way that this bed is going to make it through this   well   it did it   there was not one scratch ding or dent in the entire bed   also   there is an extra electrical outlet in the bed of the truck   this is great for trailers   power tools and camping   it came with a hard top cover   the explorer sport trac came equipped with a v    but it feels like it is a v    it is fully loaded   electrical mirrors   windows   locks and driver seats   there are leather seats there is an overhead counsel that indicates direction and the temperature   it will also let you know of sever conditions outside   such as icy roads or extreme heat   there is also a rear control panel for the back seat passengers   it lets you control the heat   fan   and radio from the back seat   i think that this vehicle is perfect for everyone   weather you are looking for a family car or a sporty little truck   you have found the perfect one     
1124,1,  to start off   i d like to state that i m the proud owner of a brand new sport trac   i spent a long time researching the available cars   and this turned out to be the right one for me   i found that almost all my initial concerns were incorrect   and a couple innovative features took me by surprise b exterior      this is one of the biggest head turners i ve ever seen   and it isn t just the strange hybrid that causes it   this car has character   it has the aggressive front end style that is putting on the   explorer   it s got a sturdy   rugged roof rack   it has exterior tie down hooks running the length of the bed   even the tailgate is different from anything else   with the logo embossed proudly in the center   prepare for plenty of questions from onlookers in parking lots and at intersections    b interior     the interior is the part i love   when people get in this car   they expect a simple   trucklike look   while the sport trac has rubber floors and water resistant seats   it s no truck   a great cd stereo system   white faced speedometer   comfortable bucket seats   power rear window   and more leg room than a regular explorer   if the stereo is on too loud when you turn it off   it automatically sets it to a reasonable volume when you start the car up again   keyless entry   remote entry   illuminated entry   the list goes on   the plastic texture on the dash isn t great   but other than that it s a beauty   since there s no huge empty cargo area in the back   the air conditioner and stereo work very well   the only feature i don t like on my sport trac is the rear floor console   it allows people in the back to choose what music to listen to   the problem is that there s no way for the driver to override it b engine     the sport trac engine can tow up to   lbs   however   it suffers from very poor acceleration   if you want this car to move   you have to hit the pedal to the floor   this will come as a shock even to those who frequently drive other suvs b ride     very quiet   comfortable ride   the engine is almost silent   and road noise is kept to an absolute minimum at most speeds   did a great job in stiffening the explorer frame   it makes the ride very enjoyable   and a far cry from other trucks you might encounter b handling     incredible handling   very tight turning   with wheels planted at all speeds i tested   emergency maneuvers are able to be completed with no problem   for instance   an idiot car pulled out of a parking lot right in front me   and i was able to swerve and avoid it easily    reliability   n a   claims that no maintenance will be required   but i m not absolutely sure   unfortunately   the car is too new for me to give an accurate review   however   i will say that has done a good job by marking the engine spots you would most likely need to access with bright yellow paint   they also have a roadside assistance warranty for any unexpected problems you might encounter b value     very cool car in almost every respect   unfortunately   it is also very pricey   my model ran    and i didn t bother with leather   cd changer   tonneau cover   or many of the other available features   however   i am very pleased with it so far and would definitely recommend it b initial concerns b   not enough space for groceries or other common items   poor acceleration   simple interior   cramped seats   huge size   bad ride b new realizations b   plenty of room when seats are down   poor acceleration     wonderful gadget filled interior   comfortable seats   a little bit long   but not too wide   carlike ride b conclusion   if you don t need to use an enclosed cargo area every day and occasionally carry something dirty or wet   this is definitely the car for you   it s great for scuba diving   and i m sure many other sports would benefit from it as well   the back is sturdy but light   the cabin is rugged but elegant   this is truly a hybrid br br  
1125,1,  i always thought of a vehicle in utilitarian terms   a car is a car   if it got me from point a to point b safely and without incident   it did it s job   my chevy conversion van did this without any trouble for the   years i owned it   so why is it that this vehicle has changed my mind   i chose this vehicle mainly because it was different from the other cars on the road   at first glance   i thought it was weird looking   then i looked again and thought   i can see me in one of those   suv s are so overdone now   i don t want a truck    they ride like a truck   i can t go back to a car   they are so short   a station wagon   no way   and i was just so tired of the big van yes the sporttrac fits the bill perfectly   not a   mom   car at all   enough room for all   if need be    but with a     and   year old   not a common occurance these days   the interior is comfy   the ride is smooth and quiet   with the tonneau cover it is just like a car   trunk   yet i can fold out the cage and use it for hauling   tho   nothing   dirty   those things are for my husbands truck   with the cage in regular position   i have a place to put my groceries   and they don t slide around in the bed    i was ever so tired of groceries falling out the door of my van   and mini van before that the v   engine has the   pulling out   power that i need    like a shot   i find it extremely easy   and fun to drive   and imagine my surprise at turning up a snowy hill   beginning a fishtail   turning that little switch   and sailing up the hill around the other vehicles    i ve never before appreciated the value of   wheel drive   this is my first   in the past i washed my van perhaps once a year   this one i wash once a week   sometimes more often   can you see where i m going with this the leather interior warms up quick   the heat is top notch   the dealer replaced the firestone tires for free   i think because they screwed up my order and i had to wait   months for my sporttrac   i got it in december     it has gone through a snowy and messy northeast winter with no complaints so far   i am no longer nervous about driving in the snow   tho   i still don t trust other drivers   i don t hear the whistle that i have heard others complain about i find that i park in places that maximize the visibility of my sporttrac    is that so wrong   it certainly turns heads   i let my husband take it to work once so he could show it off to his co workers   they were all very impressed   or so i m told   i enjoy picking up my daughter at school   but i am careful to look non chalant about driving this cool vehicle   perhaps in a year or two   i ll let my son borrow it   he keeps bugging me to let him   there is a drawback tho   i have to call it a vehicle   it s not a truck you know   also   i got the best color   the island blue   which is really teal   you must have mud flaps in the snow   or you get snow sludge on the rails   they are not included   or an option when i got mine   i got all the options except the moon roof    it makes the interior roof lower   and i am tall   and the   cd player   i have cd s at home   but i enjoy the radio   and i have   programmed stations to choose from   there is a single cd player and cassette player in it    do people still use cassettes while i realize that this is a new vehicle and it should be just as i wanted    after all i chose it   i have never had such an interest in a car   um   i mean vehicle   i hope that my joy in this vehicle is long lived   and only time will tell   but for now as you can see   i can not say enough about my sporttrac   and while i highly recommend it   don t buy one   or mine won t be so unique any more  
1126,1,  the first time i saw a explorer sport trac   i knew i had to have one   then i found out what they cost   but i waited a while and finally got one that was reasonably affordable and well equipped   let me state right off that this is not a technical review   i am just going to tell you what i like and don t like about the vehicle first of all   if you want a vehicle that gets attention   this is the one   the sport trac is still rare enough that a large number of people do a double take when they see it and many will come up to you to get a closer look the thing that first attracted me to the sport trac was that i wanted a four door vehicle   but i also wanted a truck   i really did not like the looks of the four door pickups   the sport trac is a good compromise   we have found the interior to be quite roomy and have carried five people quite comfortably in the vehicle   however   i would state that i would not want to take a long trip with three adults in the back seat   the front seats are fairly comfortable   but the seats could do better in terms of lumbar support   the air conditioner works quite well and there is a vent in the center console for the back seat passengers   i tend to keep this shut off   however   as it is a little noisy   the   speaker am fm cd cassette player is a good one   i would rate the sound excellent   as well as the radio reception   the floor of the vehicle is rubber   but berber carpet mats come with it   i like this feature   the rear window is a power window with three positions   closed   open   and vent   in the latter position   it is open about one inch   instrumentation in the sport trac is attractive   i enjoy the thermometer in the center overhead console   even though it looks as if the vehicle is equipped with gauges   this is a little deceiving   the oil pressure gauge is a disguised   idiot light   with only two positions the rear seats fold down to give additional cargo space   unbeknownest to many   the rear seats lock in place   making for a more secure floor for packages   etc   behind the seats is a minimal amount of cargo space for a few tools   a jack   and the like the sport trac is adequately powered   and my experience is that it handles quite well   one day a   less than attentive   driver pulled out in front of me   and i braced myself for the sound of metal against metal   however   i was able to negotiate the sport trac to avoid the other driver   so i rate it high on maneuverability   in terms of gas mileage   i get   mpg around town   although i have not been on a long trip yet   i believe i will get in the   mpg range the ride is a good one   i would rate it quite comfortable   there is a little wind noise at higher speeds   the cargo bed is smaller than a regular pickup   but i have found it to be quite adequate   a fold out cargo cage is an option   this is a good way to extend the bed to about   feet   but i placed a hard cover on my bed and removed the cage   however   i installs and removes with a minimum of effort   there are numerous tie downs in the cargo bed   which makes it easy to secure a load   i have only had my sport trac for about     months   but i have had not trouble with it   all in all   i am pleased with my purchase and would definitely do it again  
1127,1,  has done its homework on the new   sport trac   the sport trac has the most front and rear seat room of any vehicle in it s class   granted the other companies have done a great job   the sport trac is a step ahead of the rest   negative coments about rear set leg room being cramped   this is far from the truth   not only is there plenty of room for kids   an adult of   foot   inch has plenty of room for comfort   the bed is slightly shorter than other competitors but all you need to do is drop the tail gate and flip up the bed extender   with the optional extender   your bed is now a full   foot   with the ample   liter v you have plenty of power to pull your camper or boat   the standerd features here are options on other trucks   the rear power window is a great feature not seen anywhere else   granted you are slightly limited on storage space behind the rear seat   just add your optional tonneau cover and you are ready for that trip to the beach   you have done a great job on the new sport trac   it was so impressive   i bought the first one to arrive at bob dunn br br  
1128,1,  i bought my sport trac in   and have used it hard for two full years and this is what i think so far the best thing is that i m     tall and i fit in it comfortably   if that wasn t good enough   my brother is     and he has sat behind the driver seat and not griped   i can t find anyone who can top that the bed is short   but i like that   i tend no to haul a million tons of raw steel at any given time   but i do throw lots of camping equipment in the bed   or bicycles   or my mud covered dog and it works great   i purchased an aftermarket tonnau cover for the bed   the dealer one was too pricey   and i love it   the bed is extra deep and i rarely need to take the cover off of it the fact that i can fit five full grown adults and all their gear for a week long trip all into one vehicle is great   i have driven the truck through a dry   and not so dry   rocky creek bed to go caving deep in the woods of west virginia and it has amazing ground clearance   this comes at a price though   my short wife has a little trouble getting in and out i got the rear wheel drive version only   and through a couple winters in pennsylvania snow and ice   i wish i had gotten the   wheel drive instead   but at the time   the cost was too high for me the look is wonderful because i can take it out on the town and not feel like i m driving a pickup   but i can also take it home depot and not feel like the idiots putting plywood on the roof of their cavaliers   it s not overly tall like a land rover or a hummer   it s not overly long   so i can park in normal spaces in normal parking garages finally   the back power window that goes up and down is great for extra long lumber and for the dog to stick it s head out the back   now for negatives i should have gotten   wheel drive because of the outdoor activities i do in it and due to the snow and ice the turning radius is not so good the gas consumption is around    mpg   not bad for a truck   but not good for an suv when empty   just me driving it   it s a little bouncy   since it is designed to haul loads   without them   the springs are a bit much   so sometimes control is an issue for the same reason  
1129,1,  i took a sport trac for a test drive i really like the practicality of the design i am considering the leather group option as well as the sun roof option the only consideration with the sun roof is the loss of head room i think the price is moderate but i m sure there is room for negotiation to like this vehicle is a personal taste but i think it is very innovative and well thought out reliability may be another issue but if it is anything like the regular explorer it should be fine i would expect this vehicle to sell well because it serves two purposes the truck buyer and the suv buyer could both enjoy it to me it is the best of both worlds it may be tricky to get options though in the brochure there is more than one picture of bicycles with the forks of the bicycle attached to a bar that runs across the bed of the truck i have enquired at the dealership about this option and they are not sure about how much it is and when it would be available this option i would serious consider because one of the main purposes for me to purchase the truck would be to transport my bicycles br br  
1130,1,  this is my first   non car   vehicle i ve ever owned and i absolutely love it   it was difficult to pay as much for it as i did   but i am very happy with the purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat   it has just over   miles and has never had any problems   the ride is smooth and quiet   i love the lumbar support   my friends   whom drive trucks   are amazed at the ride comfort the bed may seem short   but it has never let me down   i ve moved my kitchen table   chairs   furniture   and   queen mattresses in the bed   not at the same time   using the bed extender and the handy tie down handles located at the top of the bed   it can carry a lot x handles great too   it s gotten me through heavy snows and i actually got to use it off road once   in the mud   with no problems   for more info   visit teamsporttrac
1131,1,  i ve had my   probe lx for   years   now   overall   it is quite an excellent car   and will probably drive you to the end of the earth   it has the first generation probe body style   which in my opinion looks better and much sportier than the second generation body   i bought mine with   miles on it   and the major problem i had with it was the cooling system   i had to replace the radiator   heat sensing unit   themostat   and coolant tubes   this is very important to check out   because if one of those coolant tubes break   you re not going anywhere   though this is important to check out on any used car   it s especially important on this model of probe   after i had that fixed   i have had absolutely no problems with the probe   it s a very reliable car   always starts in the winter   and has taken me on quite a few long interstate trips   i ve seen some of these things with    miles on them   the lx is one of the few models to have a    v   engine   stomp on the gas and it goes when it has to   these cars were originally built for rally races   which means on the automatic transmission   there is a manual downshifting button   if used correctly you can outrun a   but don t count on beating higher level models   the car drives quite comfortable and smoothly   although the suspensions pretty tight   so you can feel bumps in the road   it s pretty nimble too   and if you re good you can drive yourself out of a bad situation with ease   this thing has breaks from hell   it can stop on a dime   and work the brakes pretty hard too   gas mileage is pretty decent for a v    and has all kinds of computer controlled engine efficiency systems   it has electric windows   and defogger which are quite nice   the front is roomy   the back however is for midgets   and the trunk is bigger than you would expect   once you make sure everything is is running order   it ll last a long time br br  
1132,1,  recently i took the family on a   day trip to ca    in fact   we just got back today after a red eye flight   why am i writing a review instead of sleeping   waiting on laundry so i have something to wear to work tomorrow      for the duration of the trip we rented a    taurus ses    door sedan that had about    miles on it when we picked it up b the road test   during the   day trip we put over    miles on the car   i drove about    of those miles   we went from the congested highways of the san francisco bay area   to the wide open spaces of i   and the central valley   to the sierra nevadas and the twisty roads of yosemite national park   with side trips up to sacramento and sebastopol   road conditions were always dry b appearance   comfort   spaciousness   the appearance of the taurus has improved greatly since the oval mania years   of course   this improvement now means the car is average looking rather than ugly   it may not turn any heads   but it also won t appear dated in a few years   the car displays clean lines   conservative styling with a slight racy flair   sporty wheels   rather than wheel covers   are a nice touch the driver s seat is comfortable and suitable for drives of several hours   it was easy for me to find a good driving position   though i m pretty average       average weight more or less   my wife had no complaints about the passenger seat and i thought it was fine during my short stint there   backseat legroom appeared average   we had the   car seats in the back and only once stuffed someone in the back between them my mother    lest you think i have it in for my mother   she just really hates riding in the front seat   her main complaint was the hump in the middle of the floor    why is that there in a front wheel drive car anyway interior storage space is adequate   i m used to a minivan for our family travels so maybe i m a little bit spoiled when it comes to cupholders and places to throw things   the dash does not have built in cupholders   instead they are built into the cushions in the center seating position   if there is no center passenger in the front seat   the armrest is folded up and the center seat cushion flips around to reveal   cupholders and a general storage area   now revealed on the floor under the armrest are coin holders   cassette tape storage   even though we didn t have a cassette player in our car   and more general storage space   the cup holders will hold most normal sized cups but will probably not hold big gulps or larger   there are two cup holders for the back seat that are also modestly sized trunk space met our needs with no room to spare   we stored   bags in the trunk   from my wife s behemoth suitcase to a carry on sized bag   we were so tight that when we took my mother for a   night trip   i could fit her garment bag in the trunk but her small   carry on sized   bag had to ride with the passengers i don t have specs   speaker count   wattage   for the stereo system   in our car we had am fm cd   with separate controls for bass   treble   balance   and fade   we picked up a couple of cds when we discovered we had a player in the car   we didn t bring any of our own not expecting this feature   and they sounded like   well   cds   the player did its job   no skipping on bumpy roads   am fm reception was good   the stereo sounded clear and we enjoyed listening to it   both of our cars have premium sound systems so we re a little spoiled there too   it was loud enough to drown out the kids if necessary   climate control was very good   i didn t get to use the heater   but the air conditioner works very well and doesn t seem to tax the engine at all   the front defroster clears the windshield in short order   fan noise is average b miscellaneous   the key fob has buttons for door lock   unlock   trunk open   and panic   honk horn   flash lights   there were no integrated child seats   the rear windows only roll down halfway   and the doors have child switches   which prevent the door from being opened from the inside   child seat tether anchors are easily reached as they are on the rear shelf   there was some other mount at the base of the rear seat but i don t know what that was for   rear defogger works quickly   windshield washer fluid is dispensed in copious amounts so the windshield gets clean fast b ride   handling   performance   empty or loaded   the car rides very nicely   even though from the outside the car appeared at full capacity   with a full trunk and full back seat   there was no noticeable change in the ride   acceleration could be a little better   it takes a good mash of the accelerator to kick the car into passing gear and get moving   overall   though   the power is more than enough   we zipped up mountains with all our stuff   air conditioner on   through the winding mountain roads the car performed nicely   it took a little while to get a feel for the car   normally i drive a mitsubishi eclipse   but when i did i was able to safely navigate the turns at a decent rate of speed   fast enough to make my wife tell me to slow down at least no one rode our tail   on the flat   droning asphalt of i   the car tracked steady   largely unaffected by the wind or trucks   cruise control works as advertised   though i didn t test it on hills i did not track gas mileage but fuel consumption appears average   given my lead foot   from the east bay to our destination in yosemite   a trip of about   miles   the car used less than    of a tank of gas   this drive consists of solid freeway traffic   high speed interstate driving   and a   foot climb into the mountains   the car takes regular unleaded all in all this is very nice car to drive   i don t think i d call it   fun   but it makes driving as painless as possible  
1133,1,  on a recent vacation   i got plenty of time to become acquainted with the   taurus     days and   miles worth   we drove from las vegas to la   san diego   and laughlin the exterior of the car has a modern look is is a vast improvement from the last generation of taurus that looked like an egg on wheels   nothing too fancy and not bland   perfect mix for a family car the taurus has a well laid out interior   all switches were easily within reach and gages were easy to read   the   way power driver seat was easy to operate and it did not take long to find a comfortable position   overall   the interior is very generous with ample headroom and legroom the base v and automatic transmission setup was good but not great   i didn t have any problems climbing the mountains between california and nevada and the transmission downshifted at the right times   if i were to purchase a taurus for myself   i would opt for the hp engine the suspension provided a smooth   family car   ride   held corners well   and transmitted little road vibration to the cabin   the turning radius was a too little large   as a tourist   i found myself making frequent u turns   because i was lost quite a bit   and the car seemed to have a larger turning radius than similar cars in its class   i ended up making a few   point turnarounds instead of u turns due to the large turning radius i was not able to accurately measure the gas mileage as all the driving we did was highway driving   i averaged about    mpg over the trip one thing i did not like was the operation of the ac compressor with the climate control system   the ac compressor is engaged automatically at the different vent settings leaving no manual ac switch to engage or disengage   i prefer to have the ac switch separate because in mild weather i will turn the ac off to improve upon gas mileage my only other complaint was a minor build quality issue   when i opened the trunk   the lining material was pulled away from the sides and would not go back into place in closing   this was the first time i enjoyed driving a rental car   offers a good package of options at a competitive price   next time we are shopping for a family car   the taurus will be on our list  
1134,1,  let me say first   that our family already owns a   taurus wagon   we liked the wagon   and decided to look into another this year   this year we decided again to go with a   we purchased an sel which is s top of the line taurus   we got the following options   side air bags dual electric seat adjustment   adjusts height and distance from dash six cd device in trunk traction control leather seats   a promo that was free we liked the sel model because it has a stronger engine   our   wagon didn t have the best pick up   i love the way the car controls the interior temperature   you dial up the temperature via a thermostatic mechanism like your house   in the winter   when you want to heat the car   the car knows to blow the cold air though the vents by the windshield until the air heats up   then it automatically shoots the air through whichever vents you ve chosen   i also like that that the outside temperature is displayed i like the center compartment between the driver and passenger   the cup holders have been improved and work better than on the   wagon we have   it is nice also that in the back seat there is an arm rest in the middle   i have two children and now they know where their side of the seat ends i love love love the keyless entry system   there is a control button to pop the trunk which is great during shopping sprees   also   if you can t find the car in the parking lot   you can make the horn beep or pop the trunk to find it   there is a lot of trunk space and you can push the back seats down to get more space via the trunk   i like the   net   they provide which can hold groceries in the trunk without having them spill out of the bag the only minor problem with the car is that it doesn t have the best gas mileage   i can t remember exactly what we get gallon   but it will say on the sticker be sure to do your homework   there are a lot of internet sites that list what the dealer s cost is   know it before going in   we paid    over invoice  
1135,1,  maybe if my purchase of the   windstar lx passenger van had been as a new vehicle   instead of as a used vehicle with    hard miles on it   i would have enjoyed it more   or maybe if i had never gone from driving passenger vans to suvs before purchasing the windstar i would have like it more   or maybe    oh   who knows the bottom line is i really don t like this van   it had    miles on it when i traded in my beloved honda passport for it   i didn t want to give up my passport   which might also have contributed to my dislike of the windstar   but the passport had a standard transmission and the clutch   combined with stop and go driving   became painfully incompatible with my very sick left knee   financial circumstances   my knee   and the shortage of gently used suvs available in the spring of   led me to purchase the   windstar b selling features   i ve already mentioned that finances were a concern when i purchased the windstar   priced about     below any reasonably used and available suvs at the time   the windstar seemed like a bargain   i test drove the windstar   a mercury villager   and a chrysler town and country before deciding on the windstar   comfort   price and interior space were the major deciding factors as were the reliability ratings for the windstar when compared with the other passenger vans a passenger car was not an option for me    after years of driving passenger vans and suvs   i feel small and target like in a car b my   windstar   with a   cylinder    horsepower engine   the windstar is powerful enough for rapid acceleration   that s a necessity around here   and for me in general   as a light foot is something i ve never been accused of having behind the wheel comfort is great for middle and back seat passengers   with adequate legroom for adults   front seats are less comfortable   with driver s seat adjustments being minimal   but not completely unacceptable   a four hour drive to the beach is manageable   but a longer trip would require frequent stops reliability is less than expected based on the reports i had read   but not outrageous   i ve had numerous electrical problems with my windstar   including a phantom door locking problem and flaky   quot door open quot   indicators   fortunately   all problems have been minor and were not safety issues handling is typical for a passenger van   with a slightly sluggish feel   driving on curvy mountain roads   sort of my   quot acid test quot   for handling and responsiveness   is not enjoyable in the windstar the driver s seat belt has an unfortunate habit of jamming   although no passengers have ever noted a similar problem with the other seat belts   the captains seats in the center have been a blessing   preventing major sibling battles   although the mid van controls for the heat   air   and radio   which are available on one side only   have caused more than their share of conflict all driver controls are easily accessible and gauges and displays are well placed   the heater is powerful enough   which i ve not always found to be the case in passenger vans   and the air conditioner does an amazingly good job of cooling the entire vehicle quickly   drink holders are smaller than is often necessary   they won t hold a large take out drink   but there are plenty of them gas consumption   averaging around   miles per gallon   is better than i expected   although it does drop significantly when primarily city driving is done b the final analysis   now that i ve detailed the features of my   windstar and my assessment of them   i realize i don t dislike the van nearly as much as i thought i did   well   i still don t like it   but now i see that it s more a factor of my personal preference than the quality of the windstar i guess that makes me feel better   but i suppose now i ll have to stop referring to it as   quot that tank of a van i m driving quot   maybe my kids are right about this one   maybe i just need to   quot get over it quot br br  
1136,1,  i bought my   windstar because it drove well and had plenty of room inside for my family   the next year it got five stars in the crash test ratings   when someone pulled out in front of me and i hit them going about   mph   the front end crumpled in the middle just like it is designed to   my two children   in the back seat   and i walked away with minor injuries   something i feel very strongly would not have happened in a smaller   or less well built car   even though i am not a   quot mini van kind of person quot   this vehicle is great for a family   the sliding doors shut firmly   but are easy for elementary school age children to open   i am glad i got the air conditioning in the back of the van   i don t like that when you have the heater on   the air is still cool coming from the vents in the roof   i only get about   miles per gallon   i wish there was a console between the two front seats if i buy another mini van   it will be a windstar br br  
1137,1,  we own a   windstar gl   this was our first car that we ever purchased through a dealer   we have had it almost a year now   and we haven t had any problems at all with this vehicle   we are a young couple with two children   this mini van is exactly what we need as far as the kids and stuff goes   but it is also sporty enough to not make us feel like we are too old   lol we love the fact that it has the seperate air conditioning in the back   so many times i have rode in a van that you were roasting in the back and they were freezing up front   this way the kids or whoever can control their own temperature in the back   i also like the radio controls in the back for the kids   that way if they want to listen to something on a long trip they are able to use ear phones if they want   it is also nice that you can turn those controls off in case your kids are too little to understand that they aren t just play buttons     the radio is nice in these vehicles too   we took it on a long trip this last summer and the ride and the handling of the car was nice   we even went up into the mountains and it handled great   no problem getting around those curves or up the mountain   this mini van is defanitly a van that the young and old can both enjoy     
1138,1,  the windstar is a great minivan for those families out there that are always on the run   i love it   it actually drives like a car even though it is pretty large   it has a nice look and is comfortable   i have had this van for four years and it is still holding up   i recommend this to anyone who wants a minivan that drives great and is worth the price   i bought it for     and it is great   i have had no problems with this car and recommend it   take it from me   the windstar is a great van and worth the price     
1139,1,  my husband of almost   years and i own a   windstar   between us   we have   kids so a mini van became a must when we got married   i had previously owned a plymouth voyager but when i met my husband   i had a small car   we bought the windstar out of necessity but i have to admit that i love the comfortable ride   the opening hatch that conveniently holds groceries or   quot surprises quot   that i don t want the kids to see right away or whatever else i chose to store back there   my family fills that van when we all go somewhere together yet still   everyone sits comfortably   if there were one thing i would like to have had on this van   it would be the now popular extra sliding door   that would come in handy   especially   when i want to get kids in and out and would like to not fan the baby   another drawback to this particular van is that we have had continuous problems with the check engine light coming on and for some reason   the drivers side window is now refusing to come down   we ve had it in the shop many times and they reset the computer and all is well until the next go around   now   the warranty is out so we don t rush it in anymore   the check engine light is out but the window is still giving us trouble   this is extremely annoying but as far as comfort and the way it drives   i still love it br br  
1140,1,  winstars are the coolest minivans on the market   well i guess as cool as you can get for a minivan   all of a sudden all of the other minivans look alot like the windstars   way to go to set the trend   fords minivan the windstar is about loaded with all the options that you can think about   the come well equipped with a great safety package   actually the best one out   they have pretty good power   and run rather well   my mom has one and its got alot of miles on it now and it still runs nicely   the only bad thing is the transmission   our driveway is slanted upward and when you put it in reverse to go down the driveway it pops into gear instead of just going into it   that is my only complaint well that and they hub caps were so good that someone stole them from us but oh well   we can get more br br  
1141,1,  well   my parents bought a red windstar from a dealer that buys autos at auctions and such   and we got it about as brand new as a used car could be   it had about   k on it   and had barely been considered used by the dealer   so we got it for about     off   and i think my parents got it for about    in    there is plenty of legroom for everyone   and a space perfect for a cooler right next to the sliding door   which came in handy when we went down to see the huskies in the   rose bowl recently    go dawgs i recommend this vehicle to any family that wants a good versatile van that has some power   v is pretty impressive for a minivan and has room for all passengers  
1142,1,  my old tempo was on its last leg when our local dealer was having a big sale   i looked around and picked out a   escort lx   it was a year old when i got it   having a previous life as an enterprise rental car   it had about    miles on it first of all i was surprised at how much pick up the car had   at first i thought that was just because my present car had virtually none   but it still has great pick up   even four years later   this is especially important when entering the highway from an entrance ramp i am able to accelerate quickly to enter at highway speed   it is always annoying when a car enters the highway at   mph the car gets very good gas mileage   at the time it was rated for about   mph highway   mph city   depending on conditions   i find i can get even higher mileage than that   one particular trip i got about   miles to the gallon   keep your car tuned up and you should be able to do as well   using air conditioning lessons the mileage somewhat and speaking of air conditioning it works great   in fact   it gets cold and i have to turn the fan down to the first notch   sometimes i even have to turn it off   i have never had a need to use the   quot max quot   air conditioning   circulation of cold air in the back is a little more limited though   so if people in the front are cold   vents can be redirected to people in the back this car has an overdrive gear   which improves the gas mileage even more   the car does have less power in this gear and it will automatically shift down if power is needed   such as going uphill   for short stretches it is okay to let the car shift automatically   for longer hauls   though   it better to downshift to drive   so as to not stress the transmission the interior is very roomy for a economy car   there is plenty of room in the front seat passengers   the seats are adjustable for taller drivers and riders   headroom may be limited for people over about   ft   in   as long as the front seats aren t pushed back too much to accommodate taller riders   there is plenty of room for the average height adults in back   there is plenty of width for two back seat passengers   the four doors are more convenient for allowing entrance and exit of back seat passengers or for loading groceries and other stuff the trunk is quite roomy for such a small car   room will be diminished however   when you replace the   quot donut quot   they call a spare tire with a real one   you can   however   still use that concealed space to store smaller items such as oil   jumper cables   etc   one neat feature is that the back seats fold down to connect to the trunk   in this way   longer items such as gardening timbers can be placed in the trunk without sticking out into traffic the car has what is called   quot passive restraints quot   this translates to automatic seat belts and air bags   the automatic seat belts are the type that drag along the frame of the window and lock in place as soon as the key is turned in the ignition   that secures the shoulder strap in place   the lap belt is separate   which is nice because you can then adjust it to fit your body   the air bags are contained in both driver and passenger side   even with all the negative press on the potential danger of air bags   i am still glad they are there   both these features give me a break on my car insurance   another safety feature is that the rear windows will only roll down halfway   this helps ensure that children or pets do not fall out as part of the purchase price i bought an additional package for     this package entitles me to lube service at the dealer for as long as i own the car   this service is provided at every    miles or every three months whichever comes first   i consider this a very good deal since a fast lube station will run about    a whack   i have more than got my money s worth out of this service another thing i really like is the rack and pinion steering   while i can t technically tell you what that means   you will know if you don t have it   the steering is very tight   you move the wheel just a little bit and the car goes that way   this improves the car s maneuverability quite a lot   i find it easy to avoid idiotic drivers on the road as well as squeeze into a parallel parking space   a few weeks ago i had to fill in for our regular vanpool driver no rack and pinion on that van   the steering was so sloppy you could make almost a full half turn before the vehicle did anything   and every little bump jarred the wheels you had to keep a tight grip   not so   on my nice little escort about the only complaint i have is the warranty service   all three of the problems i had occurred within the first year   the first was a bent louvre in the dashboard   the whole dashboard was replaced since it is all one molded piece of plastic   for some reason that repair went smoothly and i did not have to pay a thing   but then i took it in because a clicking noise i heard while braking   it was about a    repair   i had to pay a     quot deductible quot   i understand this is a fairly common thing with car warranty s now   but even if it is i don t like it   after all   i have already paid a new car warranty of    when i bought the car   i don t feel i should have to pay anything else   anyway   the problem was fixed the one serious repair i had to do was also   thank goodness   handled under warranty   just had to pay the     but the repair was a     repair   the whole head had to be replaced   something had come loose inside the engine and had worn a groove in the head   though you might think this might be enough to turn me off the car it didn t   it made me pretty annoyed at the dealer   however   for keeping me waiting for three weeks   but actually   the car ran much better and seemed to have even more pick up and more power than before i still have the car and still love it   i should probably trade it in on something while i can get such low interest rates   but i can t bear to give up my car to get one of those new ones that looks like a colored squished marshmallow   well   maybe the focus   not quite so round   my car is white with black trim   and blue interior   it s sporty looking   but not enough to attract the attention of police with radar   i would recommend it as an economy car and for couples   though it could fit a family of four   there is probably not enough room if going on a long enough trip to need luggage   well   not without a rack on top br br  
1143,1,  at first   i wasn t very excited about getting my   escort   i had just turned   and was hoping for something more along the lines of a v camaro   or a big muddin   truck   then as i drove my escort more and more   i began to realize how much i really did appreciate its features   all my friends with those huge engines spend a small fortune in gas money   while my little   cylinder costs about    a week on average   i drive mainly to school and work   but sometimes i take trips all over the nation to race my bicycle   on the highway   the escort runs like a champ   it gets wonderful gas mileage   and it rides really nice and quiet   it can really move if you want it to   i have topped mine out at mph   and it still managed its smooth ride   it felt like it was meant to be driven fast like that   i have only had a few minor mechanical problems with it   i have purchased a new set of tires   a fan belt   and a battery   the biggest problem that i have had is the brakes   i have spent a total of at least    replacing them   the first time   i bought all new brakes   pads   and cylinders   the second time   i decide to buy new pads   it has been over a month since the second trip to the shop   and they haven t squeeked yet   i would recommend the purchase of a   escort to anyone who wants an economical   quiet   and overall nice car   rather than someone who wants to drag race and spend    s fixing it up to make it nice br br  
1144,1,  there were two main reasons why i purchased this vehicle and why i will purchase it again   the first reason was price   this car was truly in my price range and i got a great deal from the dealer i purchased it from   my car payments were right were i needed them to be at the time   yet i had just purchased very dependable transportation and transportation that leads me to my second point on purchasing this vehicle   very good gas mileage   this was extremely important because i drive   miles round trip daily to and from work   when i purchased the escort gas prices were just about where they are now   approximately     a gallon   this vehicle has averaged approximately   miles to the gallon   so it is costing me less than     a day for gas   when i drive my other vehicle it costs me twice as much in gas as gas prices continue to go up   i would strongly recommend that people look at this vehicle for a very dependable and economical means of transportation br br  
1145,1,  i bought this car specifically for work   i transport disabled clients to and from job interviews   this vehicle has a lot of room without being too large   i hate driving tanks   this vehicle has been so good to me for the past   years   the maintenance required is low   i had to have a timing belt replaced at    miles   other than that it has been oil changes   brakes   and tires   the usual repairs the only complaint i have at this time is the drivers side seat belt   it has gotten stuck in the middle of moving into the lock position   i had to disconnect the wiring at the base of the door   otherwise it makes an annoying clicking sound   it cost over    to have this fixed   i have   friends who have escorts and this has been a problem with them also other than that i have no complaints   it is a very reliable and trustworthy car   i never have any concerns when i take it on long road trips   i hope others find this vehicle as enjoyable br br  
1146,1,  my boyfriend has owned a    escort lx wagon for almost two years now and it hasn t had any problems   when you see a escort wagon they re usually bought as business cars   ie ikon   or family cars   there are many reasons for this   they re dependability and they re comfort   his car already has    miles on it   from road trips to santa cruz   and san francisco   a lot of free way driving   but a lot of city wear too   of the two years and probably    miles he put on it himself   there hasn t been a single problem   giving it regular oil changes   and tune ups is the only expense you really have   you get about   mpg city and   freeway   the only problem with these cars   if you want to consider it a problem   is you can tell when it needs a service job   like some cars that   quot try to let you know quot   when they need service by breaking down   this one gets a little little sluggish   as if to say   quot ok   oil change please quot   or   quot give me a tune up quot   if you re planning on buying your teen a car   or yourself   and don t have the money to spend loads on timing belts   radiators etc   this is the car to choose br br  
1147,1,  this car is fabulous   i can t stop raving about it   it is perfect for new parents   the four years that my husband and i have been married   we have driven a small compact car   when we found out we were expecting our first baby   we knew that we needed a new car with more room   i began having night mares of being a mini   van girl   and when i thought about getting a wagon   all i could think about was the big green brady bunch goose   i knew i had to make some changes in my life    now that i was going to be a mommy   but i wasn t prepared for the vehicle change   praise the lord   we came across the   escort lx wagon   it is small and sleek enough to be simi   cool   and yet big enough to provide the much needed extra space   i love it   it gets great gas mileage and is so easy to handle   the heating and air systems are outstanding   it s great for the long trips back to my parents as well as the running around in town   this car is prefect for small families   especially new ones who are not ready for the mini van   but need more room than what a small car can offer br br  
1148,1,  the lease on our explorer was due to end in   months    my wife and i were planning on letting it lapse and replace it with another   smaller suv the letter from credit changed all that   basically   their   early bird   program would allow us to trade the explorer in early   with making the last   lease payments   if we bought or leased another product   we hadn t thought too seriously about another   but realized that our daughter was going to be   soon   so we thought that perhaps a focus was in our future   so   off to the dealer we went produces   different models of the focus   a   door hatchback   zx   a   door hatchback   zx   a sedan and a traditional station wagon   since the car was ultimately going to be our daughters   she came with us to help pick out   her   car   the   door was out   as i felt it would be more expensive to insure than a   door vehicle   she immediately ruled out the wagon   which left the sedan and the   door hatchback   we drove one of each   and decided that the versatility of the hatchback was a nice feature not found on too many cars   that   plus the looks didn t scream   gramma mobile    with apologies to all grandmothers reading this it took trips to   different dealers   but we finally found one that we liked   a sangria red   burgundy to the rest of the world   zx with a stick shift and abs we ve had the car now for a couple of weeks and here are my impressions after   miles styling    interior and exterior the focus   particularly in hatchback form   has some interesting styling details    the car was designed when was going through their   new edge   styling phase   the late mercury cougar was also a product of this era   the taillights   for example   are not at bumper level   but rather up in the rear pillars   on either side of the hatchback glass   odd   but also strangely cool to my middle aged eyes   in addition   the red of our car almost   hides   the taillights altogether during the day   triangular headlamps at the front blend in to the character of the car as well   the use of angles and curves that intersect are also interesting    beauty is in the eye of the beholder   i suppose   but no one in my family dislikes the looks of the car the same theme dominates the inside of the vehicle as well    there are lots of diagonal slashes across the dashboard   and the organization of the stereo and hvac controls is quite easy to master   my daughter   especially   liked the big digital readout of the stereo and how close it is to the driver   the only thing i find odd   and it seems to be endemic to fords   is the lack of a redline mark on the tachometer   especially for a new driver   knowing how fast the engine can rev before bad things start to happen is something pretty important interior space on our first test drive   i actually rode in the back seat   my wife drove   and our daughter rode shotgun   i was impressed by the amount of room i had   both for my legs and my head   i truly thought the sloping roof design of the hatchback was going to restrict headroom   but that wasn t the case   now   i will admit that i could not see myself riding in the backseat on a cross country road trip   but for a trip of a few hours   i could be reasonably comfortable i actually did not get to drive the car for a few days   when i did   i was again surprised at how much room i had   the seats are height adjustable   on our trim level   which is known as   comfort    so i could put a couple of inches between the top of my head and the roof   the steering wheel adjusts for both reach and rake   meaning the wheel goes in and out as well as up and down     this translates into a driver s seat that    of the population should be able to get comfortable with   the gearshift falls readily to the right hand   and i ve already mentioned the stereo and hvac controls   sight lines are good   there really are not any major blind spots    again   something important for the first time driver   the only thing that takes a moment to get used to    and it is really only a problem if you have driven other stick shift equipped cars    is that to find reverse   a ring has to be pulled up on the gearshift before putting the gear lever into that spot   the first time my wife had to back up   she had to look up in the owner s manual how to do this the driving experience in europe   the focus is hailed by many of the car magazines as one of the best handling small cars available   here in the united states   the focus has been on car and driver magazine s    best cars   for   straight years after driving the focus   i can see why these accolades are heaped upon the   for a small car   it goes   stops and turns quite nicely   our zx has the    liter   zetec   engine   which makes   horsepower   completely adequate   i must say   coupled with the smooth shifting   speed   the focus has no problem getting out of its own way   the space between gears is nice and short   and the clutch action is smooth and predictable    again   nice traits for a first car we test drove a focus with an automatic   and while that might have been a better fit for our daughter   my wife and i both believe that you have more control over your car with a stick shift   especially when poor weather hits   in addition   the automatic takes all the verve out of the engine   you practically have to floor it to keep the momentum up ride and handling are also above par   while it won t ever be confused with a lexus for ride quality or a bmw for carving corners   the focus can more than hold its own   the suspension has evidently been tuned by to strike a nice compromise between a cushy ride and good cornering capabilities   on the highway   the only complaint i might have is a bit too much road noise from the tires   goodyear rs a   size      but   since the car will be used mainly for urban commuting   i don t see that as too much of a problem one last note    we got about    of snow last night   and my wife told me that driving the focus to work this morning was really not too bad    the combination of the high seating position and the stick shift gave her the confidence to get to work with little or no drama   summary for not a lot of money   about   k in our case   we got a car filled with creature comforts   power windows   locks and mirrors   keyless remote   a cd mp player and cruise control   safety amenities   abs and dual air bags    side air bags and traction control are optional   and enough character to hopefully keep our daughter safe and happy for many years to come   our first tank of gas returned just over   miles per gallon   so it should be inexpensive to run  
1149,1,  i got the one that has   hp with the    liter engine   this is not the   hp     liter pzev engine for late   or    this car is what i stated in the title the ride is extremely smooth   you feel like you are in a cockpit while driving   the front seat is the most comfortable i sat in   sharp turns and the power steering are great   i get    mpg for phenomenal power   before i got it i tried out some luxury sports cars   i see no difference   with it s compact size it is easier to go between cars and fit into cramped parking spaces when necessary   this is the best hatchback or compact car now for the downs to put up with if you are single   with a   speed s power can lag a little going up steep hills   passengers in the backseat will find little leg room   have up to one passenger regularly especially for long trips   for my trunk i had to buy a    in    toolbox at the hardware store for    and a    plastic box at k mart for a small car with great power and handling the   focus is as good as it gets   other hatchbacks or compact cars weigh more   claim to give more miles per gallon   and have a smaller hood area   expect costly and time consuming repairs in the long run with other little cars  
1150,1,  after two station wagons and two minivans   chryslers   we wondered if moving to a big suv would be the right move   our question now is   why did we wait so long   while minivans are quite practical for families with younger children   lower floors   easier entry   walk thru access from the front seats   our eight seat expedition is perfect for our junior high and high school aged children   not only does is suit their need to not be seen in a minivan   it affords them much more legroom and space for their bookbags   soccer balls   and extra friends   although access to the far back seat is a bit cumbersome   kids have a hard time determining which of three levers need to be unlatched to move the mid seat out of the way the slightly elevated aft seat offers all occupants a good view up ahead   our eddie bauer edition comes with efficient dual zone air conditioning with rear seat controls and radio cd buttons and headphone jacks which keeps them busy and quiet in the passenger compartment   before we committed to the expedition   we drove it home to see if it would fit into our garage   we found out that not only did it fit nicer than our old grand caravan   it was also much easier to maneuver into the garage due to it s speed sensitive power assisted steering   the higher driving position and large windows also seem to make visibility better than our caravan   on the down side   our expedition cost thousands of dollars more than the minivan   and has averaged    mpg in the course of running the kids all over town   it s rugged styling and aggresive tires are probably more suitable for at least a bit of off road driving   but i don t know if more comfortable   fuel efficient tires would ruin the overall appeal   it is an suv for heavens   sake   we intend to keep the expedition until our oldest daughter goes off to college next year   then with only two of our four children remaining at home   we may take a closer look at something a bit more practical   that new selectronic transmission   v   equipted lincoln ls seems to have my name written all over it br br  
1151,1,  well maybe not perfect for cruising for chicks   but that may be better   since i ll have my two kids in the back seat   but seriously   the expedition is an all around great time we bought the expedition because we wanted something to accommodate our   member family   the car seats   shopping bags   toys   games and the occasional grandparent   the expedition fits them all in nicely   no problem   and often all at the same time roomy   glamorous   stylish and comfortable   the expedition is an s u v of many faces   wash it up   wax it down   put on your sunday best and you can show up at the most elegant of gatherings next to ferraris and bentleys and no one would look twice   throw your bikes in the back   the kids in the car seats   cruise to mcd s for a happy meal and you ll fit right in   it is the only car i know of with multiple personality disorder   it doesn t know what the hell it is the expedition drives with almost no effort whatsoever   it practically drives itself   you can steer with one finger if you like living on the edge   and the braking is no problem for even the smallest of parents   headroom and legroom are topnotch   i should know   being    quot   i don t fit into many cars   but the expedition was made just for me the one drawback is the price of gas   and with a fuel slurping v    expect many trips to the pump   but with all the room   stylish look and comfort the expedition hands out   i won t be complaining about gas for too long   and neither will you we own the black eddie bauer version with the tan leather interior   and it is elegance all the way home   the sounds system pumps   the passing power is awesome   and the drive is smooth as silk if you have the need   head over to you dealer and take a test drive   you might just pay the dealer from the driver s seat and never get out br br  
1152,1,  i m sorry to say that the expedition i am writing about is not my own   it is my mother s   we bought it last year after our   year old aerostar died   this is one of the best cars i have ever driven and one of the biggest   you can not drive this thing if you are used to driving anything smaller than a light truck   which includes most import sedans and sub compacts   this car commands the road   not only are you sitting higher than you are in most cars   this car is only   quot   narrower than national highway specifications on minimum lane width   if you swerve back and forth in your lane often   get ready for an accident   with the expedition   you have to keep it in line    of the time   you have to feel powerful when you are driving this car   you are in complete control of the road well   not only is this car have some muscle   it has versatility   convenience   and luxury   two rear   person seats plus the two front seats make this an   seater   the back seat sits up an extra   quot   over the front seat   but the ceiling is also lifted   quot   to allow for proper headroom   there are these very cool little air conditioning vents coming out of the ceiling   which can be pointed in any direction or closed off completely   if your kids want to listed to the radio   but you would like a nice quiet conversation in the front   just bring some headphones   the kids can plug in the headphones in the back and listen to their own tunes while the adults have a conversation in the front   there are a total of   headphone jacks   two for each   person seat   both of the   person seats are removable   so taking provisions on any trip is not a problem   skis   hockey equipment   and in our case   soccer equipment has plenty of room   there are a total of   cupholders   although one requires that part of a seat be in the down position   it has a keyless entry system and can be set to automatically lock when the keys get   feet away from the car     
1153,1,  i ordered a new eddie bauer in the fall of     model   the reason i waited is because of the hp increase and the torque increase on the new triton engine   i pull a    sea ray boat which weighs over lbs and felt i needed the extra power to handle the load   the expedition handles it very well   we added all the bells and whistles ie adjustable peddles for the short wife   power drivers seat for me    disc cd changer   always get all the toys because it helps resale   i am glad finally switched from the twin i beam suspension   the new system will work much better   the ride is comfortable   like sitting up above the other traffic especially at night   gas milage is not bad   received    mpg on recent trip out west   i also own a   f eddie bauer that does not do as good on milage so i guess the   mpg is not bad   i waited for the new excursion to come out but kept delaying   after looking at the new excursion i am glad i bought the expedition     
1154,1,  we recently purchsed this truck after years of driving a small to mid sized vehicle this was a huge change   but after having our rd baby we needed something to haul everyone around in   i am not a   mini van chick   i flat out refused to drive one so my husband and i started investigating the suv s   after months of reading   talking and searching we decided on the expedition i m very please with it   i was a little worried about how i would handle a large vehicle but it is surprisingly easy to drive   parking is a wee but tight on occasion but so far i havent had a huge problem   we opted for the x xlt version   really no need for the x when driving to the super market and school   plus that s just one extra thing that could go wrong in the future   ours has all the bells and whistles including the rear air   which is a great thing when you have   kids in the back   i was advised to get the   big     the    liter but we ended up with the     which has plenty of power and is much easier on the gas bill   though my husband claims he wants to put a super charger in it i think not   it has the rd row of seats which was a huge selling point for me   my children are now seperated and have zero reason to fight no more   mom   he s touching me   it is so very peaceful and makes me much more relaxed nothing worse than a stressed mom behind the wheel the only down fall is that there is nt a whole lot of cargo space when the rd seat is in   we recently took a trip for the weekend   all of us   and it was packed to the hilt   especially since we have an infant and god knows they need so much equipment when away from home i would highly recommend this truck to anyone who wants the space of a mini van without the minivan look  
1155,1,  i didn quot t buy it   i leased it   i leased it to try it out because i had a   explorer and i wasn t happy   the explorer wasn t what raved about   it was very noisy   lack of power   and the new    overhead cam engine had alot of problems   over the two years i had this vechile i was at the dealer   times   for recalls and noises   when i went to the dealership to give back the explorer i looked at the expedition and i really liked what i saw   the truck had alot of room   it s standard equipment had alot to offer   and the price seemed to be right   compared to the explorer where i was paying     per month   and now i could pay     more per month for more vehicle   when i picked up the truck a day later and left the dealership i couldn t get over the ride   it was like night and day   the expedition handled nice and tight   it wasn t noisy   but i thought to myself let s see what happens in a couple of months   well after two years i m still waiting   don t get me wrong i have had some problems but very minor   the rear wiper stop working due to a loose wire   there was a recall on the signal switch   and on the tires which were rectified immediatly   those were the only times i been to the dealership in the two years   except for regular maintence i would highly recommend this vehicle to anybody who likes a low maintence vehicle   but most of all i would recommend this vehicle to the big family or for the person who needs alot of room and wants a really nice comfortable ride instead of getting a big oversized chevy that s very tinny and sloppy     
1156,1,  i first had a new expedition years ago xtl silver i had never driven anything like it before   it handled and rode like large car and not a big truck   but the biggest surprise came on december day with the first light snow with five o clock traffic when a little white car slid in front of me from the second lane on an exit ramp leading to another superhighway   with no space to stop   and not wanting to squash the smaller car to pieces   i swerved with complete control to a small space between the end of the lane i was in and guard rail to keep vehicles from falling down an incline   in a split second i was around the white car   proceeding in front of it on a curve toward the superhighway   i never lost control and everything about the expedition responded better than any vehicle i have ever been in   it truly saved my life and the life of the driver of the white car   i drove that same expediton for two years and    miles   it went through snow   ice   off terrain encounters and was finally turned back in two years later   i immediately went out and purchased a new   eddie bauer expedition and found the same type of feeling of security and the fantastic ability to see around everything else   and have heard a number of stories of expeditions that have survived tremendous crashes with the occupants able to walk away   one other special is it comes equipped with a fantastic cd radio cassette system   it s truly a fantastic vehicle br br  
1157,1,  i love my expedition   i purchased my expedition in august   and have been driving it since   i have two kids who are involved in all sports and this car has been the best for transporting them from place to place   there is more than enough room for anything needed   balls   equipment etc   this car is very dependable and comfortable   the gas mileage is not the best   but what do you expect for a big vehicle   it is a great vehicle to travel in not only is it spacious   but all the extras are wonderful   i recently traveled eight hours with my two kids and it sure was nice for each kid to have their own seat and their own air controls   i even felt safe on the freeway   the expedition also has good suspension and brake pedals to adjust to the driver   before purchasing the expedition   i test drove other suv s and i have to say this is the best in it s class   after being in the expedition other suv s felt generic to me especially the chevy tahoe   but then   what do you expect from chevy br br  
1158,1,  okay   i ll admit it   i used to be a mom in a mini van   and now i ve become something even more dreaded   a mom in a big   horkin   expedition but guess what   this car is a dream car   not only because it s comfortable and it drives well   but also because whenever i drive it   other people in itty bitty cars actually move out of my way maybe it s the way i weave precariously in and out of lanes   or maybe it s just because i m in a car that s large enough to run down a tercel and barely leave a mark   whatever   i love being the biggest car in the carpool lane   i love the way my window aligns with the mcdonald s drive through window just right   and i love that i m surrounded by what feels like tons of ice green steel my kids are safe   i m safe   and what else can i say   i m big br br  
1159,1,  this vehicle is safe   i love the   wheel drive which is almost slip thru in the weather we are having right now   driving this car is like riding a cloud   the ride is calm and not bumpy i recommend this to tall people and people who love to half some fun on the streets   the car can handle in tough situation like snow and mud the inside is roomy   the back seat is even comfortable enough to sit in   it cost is well for a vehicle this size too   the car is equiped with a awd   h or l so u can set up your driving style   the car is also big enought to carry loads of camping stuff or boxes to work   it s acar suitable for every person a workamn or fun having person or both br br  
1160,1,  after several mb s   two different sets of jaguars   yes   one to drive and one to leave at the shop   audis   mine never self propelled   and other brands too numerous to mention   both foreign and domestic   i have to admit i ve never had more fun or comfort that i get from my   expeditionwd eddie bauer i d like it even more if the dealer could fix the awd   which   when activated   manages to blink the   quot awd on quot   indicator like a turn signal   but what the heck   i ve still got wd hi and lo   so i m not really upset despite the   unsuccessful tries   now they say they have the right parts in stock and will repair it next time i drop by for routine service at    miles the car   truck   looks and drives like it did when it was brand new   that means   among other things   it still gets   mpg   and i still scrunch down in my seat when i m in indoor parking garages because the combined extra height from the   inch wheels and the roof rack produces a nerve jarring    quot   profile that some day may become a convertible when one of those overhead garage beams is a few inches lower than the sign at the entrance says it is   clearance on my at home garage door frame is about two inches    phew   recommended accessory    a third seat prop bar that lets you leave the seat in while propping it up to reclaim stowage space   for     you can get one at knoxx good sound system   nice leather   good trimwork and   overall   a very comfortable ride in town and on the freeway   it s almost enough to make you believe that when claims   quot quality is job    quot   they mean it br br  
1161,1,  we bought this vehicle because it was newer   we got a good deal   and it holds more passengers we love the way it handles   we had an explorer before   which really was fun   but the expedition handles like a large   luxury automobile   not a truck   and it s attractive and incredibly roomy we really can fit everyone in   my husband   myself and my son     and   lbs   two step daughters   husband   brother and two nephews   oh and my dog   truffles we tolerate the gas useage and it s size can be a bummer when it comes to parking availability for compact cars   there needs to be more parking spaces for suv s since they are increasing in popularity don t buy this car if you have no where to park it   but that s the only reason not to buy if you have to schlepp anyone around   if you need space for cargo   this is the vehicle for you i wouldn t part with it for any other suv or truck br br  
1162,1,  ah yes   behold   another rental car review    with my sentra se in the shop   don t worry   just a little fender bender   i now get a chance to review another car   this time   it is the focus lx    although it doesn t say so in the back i wonder if this is the same car that another one of our beloved reviewers drove   as it is the same cloud nine white colour   and i m in the same   bay   area   then again   i m sure enterprise has a fleet of these cars anyways   as they make great cheap rental cars   too bad the prius can t make it   it d be great for renting thanks for it sipping gas conservitively the car that was given me was just washed and clean   with k miles on the odometer   going thru the glove box reviled the manual   which informs me that it is a   model   oh   did i mention that the interior was funky   i mean it smelled funky   and a bit dirty   too   oh well   that s what happens after k worth of previous drivers b exterior   this is a very attractive car from the outside   it looks very much european   because it was designed there   by the way   and it also have the build quaility of one   not bad for a base econo car   it has sharp lines and curves   much like a volkswagen has   small    steel wheels with covers makes the car screem   i m cute   as the body looks like it needs a little more support from a larger set of wheels the front fascia looks aggressive   but can still be mistaken for a neon at night   thanks to the position of the turn signals   the back   however   reminds me of the newly designed honda civic   except that the lights actually glow in a circle   instead of a tranversed   u oh   let s not forget the antenna     the cute little antenna in front center of the roof   like most european cars do   vw   the only thing missing that would make it even more euro like are sidemarkers b interior   how can i put it   it s   interesting it looks a bit of a mess   like someone just thrown it together   and even if not   it looks more like a picaso painting if anything else   it certainly matches the exterior well   with sharp lines and curves   triangles   etc   about the only thing normal looking are the gauges   sadly   the base lx does not have a tachameter   which makes the instrument panel look a bit plain front seats are confortable   but not too supportive   and   for some reason   saftey reason   the steering wheel is a bit off from center   making it awkward to drive once you notice it   rear seats are surprisingly confortable   and was able to lull passengers to sleep in a long road trip   just let only   adults back there and no more   please   while not spacious   leg room is surprisingly adaquate as well visibility does pose a bit of a problem   the side mirrors are too small   while the rear window shares the same problem   the rearview mirror is small as well   and barely covered the entire rear window   the view to the back makes the car seem like it has a butt that is very jacked up   and i do mean up   seems the rear is pretty high for a compact car b creature comforts   the stereo is one item most will reach out for   and it will only disapoint if alll you carried to your trip are cds   standard issue radio cassette just doesn t cut it   the volume is not very gradule   as it steps up and down in very discrete steps   going from    very audible   to   gets you very frustrated   as you can t have anything else inbetween   the   setting is still very audible when the car is stopped at a red light   and sounds as if you can still lower it a little more   no fine volume tuning for you   buster the stereo also comes with an anti theft device   how very insulting to car stereo thieves   as a section of the radio preset buttons can be taken with you   the whole anti theft unit can be stored like a pen in your pocket   as there is a pen like clip built in   gee how thoughtful strange thing is   it does have one   luxo   feature   which is the automatic volume speed control   or whatever calls it   as you drive faster   the volume gets louder   when you stop   it comes back down   very annoying   actually   and fortunately   can be turned off   gm cars are having it everyone on their cars   though   seen one on a pontiac sunbird too   yes   that s an econo rental car   as well the speakers are very boomy and clear   these are the best speakers i ve ever heard on a car being stock   this is very surprising   as it is the most basic system   with only   speakers on the doors   perhaps it is the placement of it   who knows most cars have the rear speakers on the rear dash   and i guess putting it on the rear doors make that much of a difference   highs are clearly high   while lows can be felt   i could swear there is an aftermarket sub somewhere hidden in the car now for the windows and locks   all manual   this car is completely backwards   the locks are locked when the tab is not flush with the handles   weird   huh   most car manufacturers with tab locks would have it locked when the tab is flush with the handle door   and unlocked when the tab is stickin   out or just look like it is crying out for attention   sticks out   the focus is totally backwards   same for the window cranks   to open the windows   you must pretend you are closing it   and crank it that way   in otherwords   you must crank it away from you to open   while in other cars   that s the way to close windows manually the locks are very confusing   especially since it is manual   as everyone has to lock the door   i can t trust anyone when i ask them   did you lock the doors   all say   yes   but when i checked   all were still unlocked   hmm the climate controls are a bit easier to contend with   however   the ac and recirculate buttons are positioned too low   which makes it a bit of a hassle to drive and look at where your fingers are hitting b the drive   i m very surprised to find out that this    liter engine puts only   hp   it must be the torque   being at   lb ft     rpms   that gives this engine the power to move quickly from stops   which is very evident from the moment you step on the pedal   acceleration is quick   even when you are already moving   the   speed automatic is not smooth at times   but still gets the job done   when driven conservitively   however   you won t be able to notice it   i guess the jerking is for those people who enjoy feeling it when they push the car hard   but keep in mind   this is suppose to be an automatic   automatics are suppose to be smooth and seamless   the transmission also allows the driver to turn off overdrive   which does not allow the transmission to use th gear   i never found the need to turn it off   really   if you wanted to downshift   just hit the pedal hard   the only real need for it is if you need to be in rd constantly   like if you were towing something   or dragging something from behind though i don t know who would be doing that    whistles innocently the engine is sooo torquey   that i squealed the tires very easily on dry pavement    keep in mind that this is an automatic   then again   it may just be bad slippery tires   as they squeal even on mild curves like on and off ramps   then again   i may be driving it a tad faster than most consider comfortable   which isn t that bad   hey   my car doesn t squeal like a pig   the body rolls as well when taking corners   but nothing that would make the ride uncomfortable   after all   people who own this base car don t usually drive like this anyways    old kia commercial     don t worry   honey it s a rental   you may just want to get the sportier zts   or the zx hatchback    perhaps it s the last driver that trashed it   but   the brakes are very noisey and feels uneven   i say this because it felt like a warped rotor   so i can t really comment on how the brake feels without finding out if it truely are the brakes   they do stop the car confidently   but shakes like hell   this is not abs   people   as it isn t even included here   front plow for stopping this car quickly does show up with revenge   however   the suspension is super soft   considering the body roll and front plow for such a soft suspension   it sure does let a lot of road noise in   i have never heard such loud road noise   you can barely listen to the radio   or even hold a conversation with your passengers   we had to yell at the top of our lungs   below   mph   however   and it s bareable b conclusion   only if you can live with it   i say   i sure do hope the higher trims fix most of the glaring annoyances of this car   but just as i said about the neon   it s a good rental   make sure you sugar coat it if you want to buy it i don t exactly know what the   price is   but for    the base lx is      but i doubt that price includes ac or automatic transmission   i think as the other reviewer i mentioned who probably drove the exact same car i drove   it was probably     as tested  
1163,1,  i needed a vehicle with enough room to seat   people    in car seats   four doors was something of a must as the extra   doors help to make the process of buckling in youngsters go a little smoother   i also wanted something that would be easy on gas as i do a lot of driving   my search did not start out with the focus in mind   rather i looked at and test drove most of the cars in its class before making a decision   the main selling point for us on this vehicle was the test drive   the car surprised me at how quiet it is and the ride was also good for a small car   gas mileage on the sticker was posted as   city   and   highway   the only thing i was not impressed with on the test drive was the visibility but i ll get to that later   a quick check to see how the car seats fit in the back and the rest was a matter of settling on a final price with our local dealer   after owning the focus for about a month i am still very happy with my choice but there are a few gripes i have with this vehicle   the exterior styling of the sedan version leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion but also contributes to two shortcomings   i can t see the front end of the car nor can i see the back end   from the drivers seat   pay close attention to this on the test drive as it may prove to be unacceptable to some drivers   the base engine is adequate for the flat terrain where i live but i d opt for the stronger zetec option if i lived in a hilly or mountainous region   i would also have preferred an extra inch of cleaning surface on the drivers side windshield wiper   one thing to keep in mind when car shopping in this class is the list of standard options   i believe was a little stingy in this respect   aside from floor mats   rear defrost   interior trunk release   passive anti theft system and am fm cassette most of the other standard options on the lx sedan are very basic   if you want abs   ac   automatic transmission   etc   you ll need to add potentially expensive options   fortunately the gripes have been mild and my overall impression remains high   the   speed transmission and clutch have proven thus far to be the smoothest i have used   the car does not have a workmanship defect that i have found and has not needed any repair   the mixed bag of driving i do has yielded almost mpg   driving position is comfortable and the air conditioner has been more than up to the job   according to our insurance agent rates for this vehicle are pretty much average for a small car   as a final bonus the trunk holds more than i expected from a car in this class although the high trunk probably contributes to the lack of rear visibility   if you re in the market for a small car you ll of course want to check out epinions but might also want to take a look at carpoint msn homepage default asp you can check specs   rebate information   pricing   invoice and retail   check safety ratings   compare with similar vehicles   etc  
1164,1,  i absolutely love my   focus wagon   i bought it because my old car died and i really wanted an suv   but could not stomach paying almost     per gallon of gas to fill one up all the time   or for that matter   higher insurance premiums   this car gets   mpg on the highway   i needed room in my car for our mountain bikes   surprise   it comes   not an option   with an adjustable roof rack that was extremely easy to outfit with two bike racks   there is nothing i don t like about this car   however an all wheel drive option would be great because i do take it on dirt roads   all the better to access trailheads   it is a blast to drive   handles wonderfully   and has alot more power than i expected out of a four cylinder car   very zippy   i did get the zetec engine   so it has a little more power than the standard engine   i recommend this car for anyone considering an suv but who may    and shouldn t we all   have reservations about their environmental impact   less emissions   less gas   and really now   how often do you take that x suv off road   people who should not buy this car are those of you who follow the adage   quot bigger is better quot   i have all the room i need   even if we do have kids in a year or so br br  
1165,1,  my   focus zx just passed the   mile mark and i love driving it   i chose twilight blue w   medium graphite interior   it s a great combination   i like how there is a patterned appearance in the center of the seats i also have the power and premium option packages   as well as the manual moonroof   i m not a big fan of having to order a whole range of options in one big package   but i think every car does that now   the power package gives you keyless entry    which is great when you ve got an armful of groceries or packages   you can just hit the blue trunk release and up goes the hatch   well   it doesn t exactly go up   but it does open enough for you to nudge it up into full open position   also included are power windows   mirrors   and locks the premium package includes air conditioning   front center armrest   speed control   map lights   tilt telescoping steering wheel   p r tires    inch   spoke aluminum wheels the armrest is nice   but i have to say that they don t exactly give you a plethora of storage space inside   a bit skimpy i think   i d like to have been able to put my cd s inside the armrest and as i said   i ordered the manual moonroof   at first i was leaning away from it   part of me thought a manual moonroof would be cheap   but it really isn t   you can fully open it   or crank it the other way and just use it to get some fresh air in the car without completely messing up your hair   i don t like the cupholders and the changeholder   the cupholders are placed in an awkward position and make it a chore to remove your beverage   the changeholder is high up on the dash and is very small    it s cumbersome to remove coins the seats are extremely comfortable   they have side bolsters which give you the feeling of being held in place   but not in an overly restrictive way   i just feel secure and i like that   also   with the manual seat height adjustment and the tilt telescopic steering wheel it s easy for even a shorty like me to have a great view of the road and not have my chin touching the steering wheel   my dad sat in it   he s got a lincoln towncar and is a   big car   kind of guy   and he had plenty of room also my zx is a   speed   which i would recommend because i think manual transmissions are just more fun to drive   a bit of a pain to learn   but once you don t you ll love it    unless you frequently get stuck in long traffic   then you may not love it quite as much as you continually shift from st to nd   the zetec engine coupled with the stick shift gives tons of zip   i find myself speeding frequently and having to slow down    sometimes the car just gets away from me a little   breaking has not been an issue   it stops just fine i m not a gearhead so i can t get into specifics about engine performance and specifications   all i know is that i adore this car inside and out and look forward to driving it every day  
1166,1,  to begin   i should say that this car was not my first choice   my heart was set on a new honda civic   i had test driven the new   door coupe and had fallen in love   and after the problems i had experienced with my    jetta   the review is at   a href auto review ed cefe adfc prod tk cb    epinions auto review ed cefe adfc prod tk cb    a   if you re interested   i wanted a car with a reputation for reliability   not only that   from witnessing problems other family members had been faced with with their own vehicles   i had decided that wasn t even worth considering   finally after dealership after dealership refusing to give me what i needed for my jetta in a trade in   i was still financed up to my neck   i ended up test driving a focus   only half seriously   but not only did they offer me what i needed for my trade in   they also had a program where they will add up to    onto the purchase price of the vehicle   and give it to you in a cheque so that you can go on a trip or pay credit cards or whatever you feel like doing with it   seeing as the jetta ran up my credit cards significantly   and this was the perfect opportunity to unload the thing   i jumped on it   and managed to bargain them down to close to invoice price   i ve only owned it since mid may   but so far no regrets my focus is a fort knox gold se   with the standard hp    litre spi engine and manual transmission   it has loads of standard equipment   such as a c   cd player   and remote keyless entry    everything my jetta had and more   the one i bought had the   comfort group   which included map lights   tilt telescopic steering wheel   and cruise control   i don t think i would have bothered with this package had i ordered the car from the factory   but i love the tilt telescopic wheel   unfortunately the cruise control hasn t worked from the beginning   and i ve been waiting   weeks now for parts   very annoying   because though this is not a life or death option   i have to wonder if all parts take this long to come in now though i haven t owned this car very long   i ve put almost kms on it already   so now that it s reasonably well broken in   i feel i can write a decent opinion about it i ll start with the transmission   before i bought this car i had never driven a manual tranny   so i can t really compare it to anything   i do know that it took me no time to figure it out and i can get some beautifully smooth shifts out of it   far smoother than the jetta s clunky automatic tranny   i let my parents drive it from time to time if i don t need it   and they both could go on for hours about how nicely this car shifts and how positive it is   the one thing that i could have really used while learning to drive it is a tachometer   i have no idea if i am over revving the thing and it s a bit unnerving   the   shift up   indicator is a joke   it comes on at the stupidest times and if you follow it the car lurches and lugs constantly   i try to ignore it and go roughly by what the owners manual says   but even then it seems like it s too soon   i have found it goes best if i shift at   kph higher than what the manual says   and i still get over kms on a tank of gas   so not too shabby   the jetta had a bigger gas tank and i was lucky to get kms out of it   i m still getting used to stop and go traffic so as i get better at that i suspect i ll get even better mileage in the city   however i am doing much less highway driving than i was a month ago   it accounted for about    of my kilometres   now maybe    at best   so i doubt i ll see much of a difference in my gas mileage now to the engine performance handling   this thing is loud   good for knowing when to shift   but takes away from the initial refined feel of the car   fortunately there is a really cool feature on the stereo that pumps the volume up to compensate for the engine noise   the car has pretty good pick up as far as i am concerned   but keep in mind that before the jetta i drove a   cylindar subaru justy for   years so i m used to sluggish cars   i think this car would keep up with my old jetta   but not on hills   especially mountain highways   it s rather pathetic   even if you shift down   since i don t have a tachometer i am not comfortable experimenting with shifting down again   so i live with it   on the flat road the car handles kph quite nicely   even though it is a relatively tall car   it seems to hug the road and handles curves beautifully   and that stereo just keeps pumping out exceptional sound the interior is wonderful   so smooth and sleek   feels way richer than it really is   just don t look too closely   some seams are uneven   and parts like the air vents feel like you could just pull them right out with little effort    my friends and i are thinking of betting on how long it will take before the window handles break off   but then when it comes to this stuff i am rather picky   where the shift console meets the carpet really bothers me   it looks like someone just cut the plastic quickly with scissors   as far as roominess goes   i am very pleased   the bucket seats are slightly hollowed in the back so that knees don t press into the front passengers   backs so to offer extra leg room   there s lots of head room    even my     boss had room to spare    and you don t feel like you re going to bash elbows with the person beside you   i don t know that i d try to fit   people in the back   but with the middle seat having a shoulder belt i would feel safe doing it   it already has a couple rattles   which are annoying   but not unbearable   though it is disappointing that they have started this early in the car s life trunk space is huge   and if someone manages to get locked in the trunk   there s a glow in the dark handle which can be pulled to open it from the inside   so far none of my friends have volunteered to try this little feature out   the chickens   to make the back seats lie flat you have to pull knobs in the trunk   not sure if i like that or not   i guess it s nice that anything in the trunk is secure   i m just used to doing it from inside the car i have to say i am very happy i bought this car so far   it has far exceded my expectations for cars   it has also been a good replacement for the jetta as it has most of the features the jetta did   plus a few extra   i would recommend this car to anyone as disgusted with vw as i am   young people just out of college   or young families   if you re a speed demon   you ll probably want to upgrade to the zetec engine   it s not expensive   and it gives you hp which is hp more than the spi   my only regret is that i didn t upgrade to that engine  
1167,1,  when the focus was announced as the replacement to the popular escort   i must admit   i had my doubts   after years of   s domination where nearly every drive in the country had a sierra   escort or fiesta on it   were struggling to keep up with the cheaper and more reliable japanese models that flooded the market in the   s   were losing shed loads of money to its competition in europe and still is   so was the focus really the market saviour   well   no   i do nt think it was or is   in the mid   s when it first hit the streets i just thought    oh my god   what is that ugly thing   yet it seems to have spawned a whole host of ugly mobiles from various manufacturers   the straight orderly lines of   s cars had been replaced by uneven and ugly curves that appeared to have come straight off the concept board   ok it had been beaten to the medium size car market by the even uglier and more wierd fiat brava and bravo but this was the first major player to make a statement   looks     looking at the car from the outside makes you think    hang on   from the front it looks just like a fiesta ka   well it does with its sloping pointy angry looking headlights and oval grille   moving back along the doors   they seem to take up the majority of the side panels   its the rear of the car that really confuses me   it is possibly the ugliest monstrosity to come out of the design house at dunton   essex   no boot   well it is a hatchback   but it is all part of the rear of the car   i liken it to the equally confused looking nissan almera for stragest boot in the world prize   it looks like it has had a rear end shunt and the lights have ended up somewhere at the top of the car   i do nt like this   interior     typical plastic adorns the interior   all fords smell the same   plastic   the dash is very arty with its white dials that are so common today   the stereo takes up most of the centre console and looks a nightmare if you want to install an after market unit   thankfully the people who supplied the stereo   visteon   have done themselves proud by making a half decent effort at the sound system   this is something s have lacked for sometime   handling     suprisingly good   traction control really helps out the wheelspin and abs stops you when you ask   no skidding or slipping here   the semi stiff shocks give you a nice level ride but can be a bit severe on your bad back if you hit the bumps   still   a nice drive on the motorway   acceleration     after driving both the    and    models   you can notice a pulling difference between these cars   the    allows you to pull into the traffic when you want rather than wait for a gap big enough   its no neck breaker but ample for most people   that s because it has its power supplied by one of the best engines in the market   the zetec   safety     it held up well in crash test and does come with both driver and passenger air bags   overall     i d give this   out of    handles good   drives nice but a bit ugly   i m afraid i do nt think it was the saviour wanted   information     visit the website to check it out further   co uk fer are some stats for you     zetec   mph time      seconds power output     hp     rpm fuel consumption   mpg on motorway    on urban  
1168,1,  i recently rented one of the new replacement for the escort   and lets just say that is still making progress in their small car designs the focus that i rented was a se   door sedan that was heavily optioned   it did come equipped with the standard    liter engine that had been used in the escort   having owned a   escort wagon with a manual transmission and over    trouble free mind   the focus would be considered for a replacement seems to have solved the noise and vibration problems that plagued the escort   the focus idles silently and smoothly without the rear view mirror shake that i have become accustomed to in my personal car   although the engine now is rated at   horsepower   the low end torque of the engine is such that it seems more powerful than it really is   the seating position is higher than in the escort and i found no real blind spots   around town the power with the optional automatic transmission is ideal for city conditions   and is not bad on the highway either   as i had cruised at   mph and the vehicle tracked straight and true and was immune to cross winds   compared to the   that i had rented earlier in the year   the focus was actually superior on the highway and the seating position lets one get a better focus on the road ahead of you   handling and braking are very   very good   but gas mileage is lower than what the escort could achieve   but is still over mpg on the highway but there is no such thing as a perfect car   despite what anyone thinks   the funky interior and exterior design takes some getting used to   and i guess that it would have to grow on you   the interior now places the stereo system above the heat and a c controls as opposed to the opposite in the old escort   and that is a welcomed change as one generally will fiddle with the radio more than the climate control system   the optional cd player takes up a lot of real estate on the dash and the controls are somewhat confusing   the ash try is placed right behind the steering wheel and is difficult to find in the day and down right impossible to find at night   the cup holders are down really low and difficult to reach   i also don t like the self locking feature that causes the car to lock all the doors when one reaches about   mph   i am quite capable of locking the doors myself   thank you very much i would have to put this vehicle high on the list though of the best of the breed in the small car world   and considering that i have recently also driven a new toyota corrolla   to me the toyota is hard to justify for    more  
1169,1,  i purchased a   focus zx   s model   not too long ago and i absolutely love it   i couldn t ask for a better vehicle   i previously owned a   mercury cougar   it was a great car until it started having problems   i haven t had a single problem with the zx yet   really did a great job designing the focus   it has a sporty yet sophisticated look to it   the model i bought had a msrp of     this included everything that i wanted   convenience group   power group   and s group   which i greatly recommend for     the s group includes premium    wheels and   series tires   premium gauges   s diamond pattern seats    disk in dash cd changer   bucket seats   rear spoiler   chrome exhaust tip   european tuned suspension   and everything that the sports group offers   not a bad deal for     the other groups included power everything and such amenities as a c   keyless entry   tilt and telescoping steering wheel   cruise control   etc   as you can tell   it is a lot for the money   there is no other car that offers this much at a reasonable price   the driving experience is excellent   i opted for the   speed manual transmission in my zx although an   speed auto is optional   the ride is exceptionally smooth for a small car due to its   wheel independent suspension   even when cruising in the highway at   mph the wind and road noise is minimal   inside the car the controls are nicely layed out and within perfect reach   headroom in the car is abundant even for someone over    tall   the seats provide great support and room   even with   adults in the car   the rear hatch provides enough room for storage   but with the split rear seats folded down the is a whoping    cubic feet of space   that s enormous for a hatchback   the only thing that could do to improve the car is have a more powerful engine offered   perhaps a    liter   the   svt model will remedy this but is going to carry a more expensive price tag at     
1170,1,  we wanted a new car   we needed a new car   we wanted a new wagon   our   taurus wagon was a loyal dog but a dog with fleas   it stunk like it was on its last leg we shopped   did internet research and the all important test drives and came up with the   focus wagon   and what a deal    plus we got credit s    financing deal   we pay no interest over   years    pretty good deal here s the review   b look     it looks great   if it didn t have the blue oval on the front and rear   you wouldn t know it was a domestic let alone a   the inside is a masterpiece   great curves   great lines b comfort     unlike the old escort models   even the zx   you don t feel like you are sitting on the pavement while in the car   what great seats    like sitting in your living room   i don t get numb butt when driving for over an hour like from other cars   driver s seat has adjustable height as well   i like mine the whole way up b function     everything is right in front of you   if you ever claim you hit that car or ran that light because you were fooling with the radio or ac   the claims adjuster will know you are lying    because you re driving a focus   cup holders on the floor in the middle are great   standard ac and cd player are cool   ac blows cool and powerful   heat comes up quickly for those brisk winter days b handling     rounding curves or making   degree turns couldn t be more comfortable   what carmakers called european handling in the   s is here in this domestic car   the se wagon comes standard with the nice zetec engine and has great pick up   what s more   the car doesn t rattle or feel like it s going to fall apart when doing   mph on the highway   you ll be speeding along at   and feel like you re going    trust me on this point    it s incredible b room     says it has more room in the inside than any other car in its class   i haven t really investigated this   but i am a believer anyways   two kids in car seats in the back haven t complained yet   and they used to be traveling in the taurus wagon with that huge bench seat   plenty of leg room up front   too b gas     the sticker says it should get   mpg in the city and   on the highway   my guess is that s about right   with moderate driving work   supermarket   etc   we go thru a fillup once a week b little things     the rear trunk pops up with the push of a button from the inside panel   automatic windows and locks respond very nicely   it has stiff handling   which is a surprise from a   you can haul a lot of stuff in this wagon    we haven t suffered by moving down a class to midsize from the taurus wagon   inside dome lights have that fade out thing when you get out and shut the doors    nice   a nice security measure is this    when using the remote clicker   only driver side door opens with one push of the unlock button   the other doors unlock with two pushes of the unlock button   this is a nice comfort for those late nights in a strange parking lot b what it could use     it could use lit vanity mirrors for the driver and passenger   put a lot of neat things in this car and this should ve been one of them   also   there should be dome or reading lights available to the backseat passengers    my kids miss theirs from the taurus wagon   it could also use those magazine pocket things on the back of the front seats so the kids can put their books and things in them    they miss them too b finally     buy it   you ll like it we got ours in white with the tan interior    looks very sharp   we had mudguards put on as well   it really turns heads and people can t believe it s a and when you test drive it   neither will you  
1171,1,  the focus caught my eye   but not my pocketbook for over a year   i believed that they were little boxes and felt as if i would be better off buying something different   boy was i wrong   i have a   toyota echo and have recently purchased a   focus   the focus seems much more stable   has better pick up and hopefully will not be as much trouble as the echo has been   the interior is very comfortable and the air conditioner is very cold   even sitting in the back seat   between two car seats   i stayed very cool   we own a hatchback   the   trunk space   is not overly large   but it is adequate   i just wouldn t take it on a long trip with all the kid s stuff   the gas mileage is great   average mileage is   per gallon   i would suggest this car to anyone looking for a new vehicle  
1172,1,  i own a   thunderbird lx automatic v    it has been the most reliable car i have ever owned   more reliable than any of several foreign cars   including a saab   the car now has    miles on it   and i have replaced only one major part   the head gasket   that was a costly     repair   but a faulty head gasket can be manufactured by any   it s just bad luck   aside from that   all other engine and drive train parts are original and functioning well one drawback is that the doors are long and heavy   and   therefore   difficult for small people to manage   their own weight caused them to sag   and i had to have them repaired   but it was not terribly expensive   there have been about three call backs   but none of them were of concern to me   and i have not had the work done what sold me on the car was the test drive   the car holds corners extremely well   and the highway ride is that of a big luxury car   the visibility is good in all directions   i have had no trouble on wet roads   and the snow handling has been satisfactory i paid about     for the car in    so the cost of about    per year   or   cents a mile   has been very reasonable all in all   i would recommend this as a good used car   if it has been well maintained   the model is out of production now   is planning to reintroduce the thunderbird as a sports car br br  
1173,1,  ok i have owned pickup trucks   and i have owned a pure   suv   and for me   each is a compromise   in considering this purchase   i had to struggle with the question is a vehicle that has both attributes nothing but a compromise at best my   nissan pathfinder was handy   it had adequate room for hauling stuff   like groceries but not practical for hauling   dirty   stuff like building materials or plants   the back seats were not particularly comfortable either   it was a bit anemic in the power category but ok   i missed my pickup   but i need a vehicle that has a real back seat and in a way   the pathfinder was a compromise that i could live with still   i occasionally hauled things in the nissan like bags of cement and bulky things from   home depot   that should never have been attempted with what is essentially a station wagon   i looked at   king cab   pickups but saw them as just pickups with wasted space for junk behind the driver s seat   the idea of putting a human being in some of those   jump seats   they put in those things is laughable even for children then came the first few   four door   pickups   owning a nissan   i stopped by and looked at a nissan truck with four   real   doors   i attempted to sit in the back seat of one   and found that for me   the only way i could get in was to physically crawl in on all fours   and then sit sideways   it is hardly a practical vehicle   for me   unless you only expect to put children in the back seats finally   last year i saw the supercrew   and said to myself there is a truck car or was it a car truck i like   essentially it seems like an expedition with a   foot truck bed instead of the space for a third row of seats   in fact   the rear seat room in the supercab is only   inches smaller than the expedition i drove the supercrew and that s all it took   i purchased the   lariat   upgraded package because i like leather seats   and the paint trim was good looking   it came with the    engine   which was listed at    extra on the base model   i drive primarily in an urban area   and own a boat   that this truck pulls without effort   i expected horrible fuel mileage   but so far   i am surprised to find that in city driving   it is virtually identical in gas consumption to the pathfinder i traded in   i realize that if loaded down   this will change drastically   however the good thing is at least with this truck   i have the option of   loading it down   while it is absolutely true that this truck is not a panacea for everyone so far   it really is for me   i can put five adults comfortabley in it   i can pull a boat or trailer effortlessly   i can haul ten bags of cement or dog food   or throw my golf clubs in the back and not worry about snagging the upholstery of an suv   i can use the bed extender and haul larger items   and i can pick up my family at the airport and not worry about my wife s   self esteem   being bruised by riding in a   pickup   the sticker price on this wonderful vehicle was actually     less than my venerable    nissan pathfinder   and while it doesn t have   wheel drive    that i hardly ever used with the nissan   it does have everything else   including almost twice the horsepower and the same gas consumption and more   the fit and finish for this   american made   vehicle is quite good   the ride is excellent   the driving handling quality is excellent and for the features   the price is good too   the icing on the cake was sponsored     financing plus a    rebate   one negative   i have to   back   it into my garage to close the door   as it is almost two feet longer than an expedition   oh well life has it s compromises  
1174,1,  i bought this truck new in   and it s still going strong today   i expect to get at least   years use out of this truck with relatively minor repairs and if i get that then i will be pushing it to get   years the truck has been used very heavily    pulling four horse trailer   loaded about     pounds   on a class iv hitch weekly for about   years   also about   bales of hay a month and   tons of grain   it has been run back and forth from halifax to toronto   sometimes with horses   sometimes without since   and has never yet failed me on the road   the most common repair on it   outside of body repairs and regular wear out and maintenance   has been u joints    and since i have sold my trailer   i am now getting about five years on the u joints instead of    months   the trailer pulling seems to affect the wear on the u joints   most parts that have been replaced on the truck have been due failure dut to rust   not wear out or failed parts electrical can be a big problem on these trucks    the big gang connector on the wiring harness caused about three months worth of grief in     the plug was cut out and all the wires were hard wired together   siliconed and there have been no problems since body has been a problem with the truck    perforation and paint   re painted the truck at their expense    a recall   the dealer was supposed to take the truck down to bare metal and re prime and paint it   as well all rust was to be repaired   the dealer did a really poor job    in fact i think paid for a lot of work that the dealer billed them for but didn t do   which has been my experience with our local dealers in the halifax dartmouth area of nova scotia   only one repair held up more than twenty four months and that was a panel that they had to cut out and a new one welded in we ve worked this truck real hard   it has over    km on it   i continue to drive it almost daily about    km per day for work   gas consumption is still about   mpg   cdn   on the highway   same as the day it was new   and less in the city   fuel economy is a little less than the gm and trucks are getting but the repairs according to friends with these trucks are fewer   fuel economy pulling a trailer is awful with this    litre eight cylinder   you need the diesel for any kind of economy   but   it s totally reliable and never breaks down and hauls loads that are twice what the truck is rated for   a friend and i do the exactly same thing with our trucks    my and her gm    and the wins out hands down every time    and it takes about a fifty percent heavier payload than her gm will it s a typical truck    lousy in the snow and on icy roads    you need about   lbs of ballast over the back axle on bad roads   the four wheel drive version might keep on going through the snow and icy roads but wait until you try to stop the   wheel drive truck once you get them going it hauls a real heavy load    we installed a set of timbren hollow rubber springs   tow truck kit   and are still running on the original springs if you can believe it    no re arching and no broken leaves   i have been hauling up to one tonne in the box   grain   with no problems by using these timbren hollow rubber springs   looks and handles like there is no load in the truck these trucks are not for city people    even though they are really comfortable for city and long distance driving   they re a   quot amp   to park in the city parking lots and on the streets   they re hard on gas in the city and if you have the full size box   and what s the point on getting anything but   and extended cab they just don t fit in the garage of most city homes    coming in at about twenty feet long but they re just great for us country folk and while i will never buy another car   i definitely will buy another truck   i m real happy with this one   it has cost us a lot less on repairs than anything we have owned in years   it s consistent   it s fixable   s service manuals are very good which helps   if you buy a used one and it s rust proofed   you should get years more on it   even if it s not rust proofed   at least it is entirely fixable    right down to the frame   i had frame repairs done last year   perforation right through the rail   body parts are becoming a problem to obtain but after market parts are still readily available   i probably won t buy another new one   can t come up with this kind of cash again for a vehicle   but it will be somebody s well used truck br br  
1175,1,  i can t believe out test drive of the new   super crew f    it has the size and power of a full size work horse but one look inside will convince you    this is no ordinary truck   the stylish features include a two tone dash   extra plush seating   fashionable grab bars   well appointed easy to read dash   steering wheel controls   matching head rests   a handy center console plus drink containers and pockets in the door panels for extra storage   also the roomy back seat could easily seat three adults and the back seats fold    to allow for lots of extra storage the ride was smooth as glass and plenty of pep for the highway   it was easy to handle in traffic and visibility was excellent as well   my husband   a gmc man   is built like a bear and he had too agree this truck has a lot to offer   the towing package also comes with a larger radiator for more efficient cooling while towing   the exterior color i really was drawn to was the new island blue   the bed is    quot   but there is an optional bar extension that will give you    of hauling space for      great appeal for both the luxury details for the ladies and brute strength for the guys   plus room for teenagers in the back seats    i recommend it for a terrific family vehicle     
1176,1,  i bought my f lariet supercrew x about a month ago   i haven t found anything that i don t like about it   i love the way it handles much better that the explorer that i traded in   the interior is wonderful   the leather is very durable   i can seat   people   the backseat is very roomy even with three kids in it   the bed extender is handy   i ve hauled a full size mattress and box springs   and the power is awesome   if you can get one with a moon roof   do it   it is a fun option   we are a family of   and totally enjoy this truck   the gas mileage is better than i thought it would be   my truck is black and requires lots of baths   but there is nothing that compares with a shiny new black truck  
1177,1,  we purchased our   f   supercrew on april th   as soon as they hit the market   i could not ask for a better truck   has all the space of a car with towing and hauling of a truck   the v   engine is more than able to pull my   ft cargo trailor   a great looking truck   i will purchase another one as soon as my time is up with this one   has hit the jackpot with this one in my book   if you like big vehicles and the ride of a car buy this truck   my truck has a am fm cd player with surround sound   automatic with cruise   power windows and door locks   i did not purchase the extended gate that is a option on this vehicle   you have plenty of room through out the truck br br  
1178,1,  we purchased our supercrew in feb     ours is a x lariat     liter   with navy blue on tan leather interior   we ve owned   trucks prior to this one   so we were quite familiar with them   my husband is a general contractor and realtor   so hauling equipment and or building supplies as well as people were both equally important   i think we ve found the best of both worlds with this truck   this truck rides well   in fact   it s the one we choose to drive long distances   we have   children   and the interior is roomy enough to please   the dual media is a nice option   and the factory radio sound quality is great here are some problems we ve encountered with this truck     as previously stated   this is our rd truck   on all    we ve always had to have the up down window button on the passenger side only   replaced   for some reason   they re always defunct   do something about this      covered by warranty     the cassette player won t release my tape   we thought maybe the tape was defective   but it turns out the cd player won t work either   our dealer has ordered us another radio which is covered by warranty     the fuel pump had to be replaced   this also was covered by warranty this truck is pretty fast too   you don t have to fret about changing lanes on the highway in this   i m ft in   and have no trouble whatsoever driving this truck   in fact   i prefer driving it to my   bmw   there are no blind spots   and it handles well   plus there s no need to cringe when you hit a pothole  
1179,1,  my wife purchased this car new in    she wanted a laser red   speed gt   and we were able to find one at a local dealer   we drove both an se and a gt for comparison   the gt is a totally different car   fast and sprung stiffly   it is a real sports car   our car is not loaded   no sunroof or leather   but has air   cruise   cd player   power locks   remote keyless entry   and a few other goodies once we had the car   we did run into several problems   all of which were minor   a leaky radiator cap   pealing paint on the hood   broken seat air pump for the bolster    i think maybe a few others i forgot about   all were corrected under warrenty   i worried about the paint the most   but they seemed to be able to fix this and it has not been a problem   we have replaced a battery   spark plug wires and tires   the goodyear eagles were done at about    miles   we replaced them with parnelli jones all seasons which work very well i now drive this car daily   and it is simply a joy to drive   it has about    miles and has been pretty much trouble free the last few years   it handles superbly    so much so i wish it had   or   more horsepower   the steering has great feel   this car is on a rail   the stick shift is fantastic   with quick shifts and smooth operation   i am    quot   so i do have to squeeze myself into this car   but i can get comfortable    no one can sit behind me though   the car has a large trunk and the seats fold down to offer tons of space for hauling larger items   finally    what a sweet looking car   wish i had something this cool back in high school   on the down side   the rear seats are not usuable for kids if you are tall like me   i have a car seat on the passanger side and have to move the passanger front seat up quite a bit in order for the seat to fit   no way we can get a nd child behind me   so this car s days are numbered   the ride is quite stiff   i mean stiff   everyone that rides in this car comments on it   you do adjust driving it daily   but it is just not very comfortable for any long trips   the paint seems to be of a lower quality than most cars   in spite of regular washing and waxing   this car is showing a few flaws   nothing terrible   but i worry about it   lastly   the v   is starting to burn a small amount of oil    about a quart every    miles   it still runs perfect     mpg in the city and   mpg on the highway i plan to trade or sell this car soon   and re sale looks pretty bad   oh well   it was fun while we had it   this is a great car for a single guy or girl    or a couple with no kids   or a teenager that wants to make it into a scca solo racer   this is not a family car    but that is part of the fun br br  
1180,1,  i ve owned my   probe for almost   years now   and what a cheap   years it has been   this car has not given me a single problem   they get great gas mileage   meaning around   to   mpg   so don t worry about having to fill it up every other   or   days cause these cars will go for weeks   it s a sporty little car   so it s very fun to drive   too   the main thing you have to consider   though   when buying a   probe is the mileage   little cars with little engines like these could last anywhere from    to    miles   you would definitely want to have the engine checked out before buying it to make sure that s its got a lot of life left in it   the only thing i would say would be an inconvenience with this car is that when something does break   it s not fun to fix it   once   i broke my key off in the ignition   don t ask how   and we had to put a whole new ignition in because it was one solid piece   rather than broken down into smaller parts that are easier to replace   has a funny way of doing things sometimes   but aside from that   they put together a very solid and fun vehicle when they made the probes   i don t know why they stopped making them   but they re great cars and definitely worth every penny  
1181,1,  when we first had a baby   i was driving an eclipse spyder   needless to say   this is not a baby car   as a matter of fact   i refuse to put my son in it   for a year   we managed to get by with one car that we could take our son around in   but   being an independent women   grin   i wanted to be able to leave the house when i was home alone with my son   which i couldn t do at this point   why didn t i just keep the   baby   car   well   mine was foreign   and my husband works at you do the math   so   we needed a new car   i refused to be a minivan mom   no offense to those of you who are   i just don t like em   so we decided on an suv   being that my husband worked at   he heard about the escape long before it came out   and i wanted one   it was an explorer   but smaller and cuter   that s a good combination considering i m small   and   well   cute    grin   but seriously   i liked the idea that it was an suv that drove like a car   it was also supposed to be much safer   without the threat of rollovers that most suv s are plagued with   so   we ordered one and after months of waiting   it came in   and it s beautiful   we got toreador red   which is a maroonish color   the interior is tan and black   the car is also available in yellow   yes   bright yellow   for you showoffs   red   a forest green   blue   black   white   and tan   i don t know the specific     names for all these colors   but that s what it breaks down to   aside from the pleasing asthetic value of the escape   it also drives great   if you are looking for a good off road vehicle   this is not the one you should be buying   but   the escape wasn t made for offroaders   it was made for people who wanted the look of an suv   with the control of a car   it s a little bumpier than a regular car   but the ride is smooth   it also corners very well   which i love   being used to a small convertible   the escape is available in   wheel drive   or   wheel drive   we chose the wd variety   you can also get a four cylinder or six cylinder engine   ours is six   according to the dealer   the four cylinder engines aren t selling as well   the escape has some great standard features   solar tint glass   woo   how new millenium   power everything   roof rack   rear windshield wipers    flip and fold   rear seats   a c   anti lock brakes   and remote keyless entry   we also got side step bars   a power moonroof   and side airbags   oh yea   did i mention that the cd player is standard   nice   eh   all this   and a great price too   the base model runs around      fully loaded   which ours is   is around      not bad for an suv   gas mileage is a little better than standard suv   city is   mpg and highway is   mpg   it s no car mileage   but still not bad   for all you mommies and daddies out there   the escape also comes with three tether hookups for the backseats   this is a great feature to help keep your child s car seat secure   and our car seat fit very well   the backseats are relatively comfortable   and there is tons of legroom   although it looks smaller than an explorer   the didn t skimp on space   the rear area leaves plenty of room for numerous parcels or luggage   there is also a cover you can place over them to protect anything from flying french fries   being a short person   i can t accurately judge the legroom in the driver s seat   but my husband   who is much taller than i am   had no problem fitting in the passenger seat   the car is very comfortable to drive   and i feel very safe with my child in the back   has added a number of safety features to the escape   making it a nice   reliable ride   it looks nice   drives well   and is priced affordably   for those parents out their looking for a good family vehicle   i highly recommend the escape   one warning   they are selling like hotcakes   so get one while you can   i believe there is quite a waiting list for orders   so if you are interested   call your dealer right away  
1182,1,  i had the opportunity to test drive the   escape after salivating over all the press clippings and related media hype for about   months   because i couldn t contain my excitement   i went to my local mazda dealership and drove the escape s sister suv   mazda tribute   base model x   v   almost a month before the escape made its bow in early september   the drive was a little less than acceptable   especially frustrating when i schooled the salesman on every single aspect of the suv   but i wanted the escape   passing by the dealership late on a sunday evening   there she was quick background   i own a   nissan xterra   v   x   loaded   and i love and loathe it   extremely comfortable and quiet ride   nice stock stereo and accessories   the engine is horribly inefficient and lacks power   thus   the need to try the escape on for size getting into the escape would be no problem for all but the tallest members of america   my two kids easily climbed in and found the seat belts    if you are trying to save a little money   think about passing on the side step bars   they can not hold much weight   and since the escape is about    inches shorter than other full sized suv s   there is a good chance you won t ever use them   one advance warning that the insulation wasn t going to be as good as other suv s was the   quot thump quot   of the doors   instead of closing with a warm   quot thump quot   the doors sounded like something off of a less expensive model   once in   i found the   way seat a nice feature   along with the no frills dashboard and controls for the fans and sunroof   the stereo was a bit too complicated   but sounds much better than the upgraded stereo in the sister mazda tribute   leather seats are stiff   but i am sure they would soften a little after a while   the model also had privacy glass   which i recommend   i had a chance to compare some of the interior dimensions for the escape   and the numbers really shocked me   the escape is as wide as an explorer   only   inches shorter than an xterra   had more leg room than the xterra   there are some other interior dimensions for the escape that are as big   if not bigger   than some of the bigger   thirstier and more expensive suv s   some over   k more   i was anxious to feel the   hp v matched to this yellow   baby suv bullet   and it passes every test i put it through   passing and accelerating are excellent   even up hills and with four average sized passengers   it tends to downshift a little quicker than i expected when pressed   but a small tradeoff for an engine that bests any other suv with that kind of power weight by at least    mpg   another trade off is the road noise   i found it was more pronounced than i would have liked   and i was raising my voice to talk to the other passengers   a little more padding and insulation in the doors would do well for the noise    hint   hint     i was able to have the experience of the night driving dash and gauge lights   and i wasn t impressed   during the daylight   the dash gauges are very impressive   the night time greenish red hue would take a little getting used to   handling is wonderful for the escape   cornering is just like a car   the escape is confident in all phases of a town or country drive   quick note   i have read some of the other excellent reviews of the escape   and air conditioning was mentioned as a problem area   i live in the north west   seattle   wa   so we rust instead of bake   i did not test the ac   but the fan seemed to work as it should if you have passed on the xterra   montero sport and crv for lack of power   jeep cherokee for persistent mechanical problems and the rav   for the looks power problems   the   escape is an excellent choice   i also suspect that it will keep its resale value very well   keep in mind the   gas electric escape that is said to get over   mpg and still has the same amount of horsepower   for those who just want to get into this suv and don t have the    k it will take to adequately equip the x v model   seriously consider the x    speed   even with a little bit of equipment   you can have a respectable suv for under   k br br  
1183,1,  my wife and i recently traded in my   dakota p u with k miles on it for this wonderful escape   after making a list of about   cars we thought we d like   we went on line and researched them all   after weeding out those    can t afford   cars   i spoke to my brother   a car expert   on his opinion   being that i own a motorcycle and haul it he suggested the escape   we went to our local dealer and test drove one and fell in love immediately   it just so happens they had the exact color with everything we wanted in stock   we ended up with the xlt    l v automatic   with all the buzzers   bells   and extras that is possible   excluding leather power seats   we have had it for a month now and we are finding that it is receiving exactly what they said we would in gas mileage      everytime   the first tank only got    but everyone after that has been at least   mpg   and we live in the dc metro area where we drive everywhere i would definetely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable suv with style  
1184,1,  the escape is not a classic suv   it has unibody construction instead of the   classic   suv s   body on frame   truck like design escape and mazda tribute are brothers   both cars were developed jointly by and mazda   part of mazda belongs to    i think something like   b engines   the base front dive escape uses the focus s   cylinder    l   hp zetec engine   the optional v   duratec    l engine   that also uses in taurus   has   horsepower and   pound feet of torque   according to   car and driver   magazine   the v   version   escape xlt   runs quarter mile for    seconds at   mph v   equipped escape goes from zero to   mph in    seconds   and gets   mpg on the highway b transmissions   the manual transmission equipped model has a floor shifter   but the automatic transmission   cde four speed   has a column shifter   b i i hate column shifters i b   you can not get the manual transmission with v    not cool b size   the size is about honda cr v but the escape feels larger than a honda   with the rear seats up   there is   cubic feet of storage space   with the seats folded down     cubic feet b wheels   there are two types of wheels available      and    the v   escape xlt uses p tr   firestone wilderness ht tires   the spare tire is    temporary one the tires are a little bit too noisy over the rough pavement b suspension   escape uses independent suspension   which offers good ride quality   the brakes are equipped with abs   front disc   rear drum   the stopping distance from   mph is   feet    better than   any   other suv   fyi   it takes nissan xterra   feet    off road   escape xlt weights about   pound escape   i read that escape s off road capabilities are challenged   comparing to the real suvs   however   with available four wheel drive   they are much better than any sedan s   escape uses the control trac ii all wheel drive system   which allows the escape to run in front wheel drive until the system senses the wheel slippage   then it sends up to    b   of the engine s torque to the rear wheels until the slippage stops   escape has a   x on   switch that does not engage the four wheel drive permanently   but engages the rear drive more quickly   which is better for severe conditions    pricing   the base front drive escape xls   with the    cylinder    l zetec engine and a five speed manual transmission   starts at      at this price the car has air conditioning   an am fm stereo with a cd player   remote keyless entry   a tilting steering wheel   and power locks   windows   and mirrors the   upscale   escape xlt has abs   aluminum wheels   cruise control   and fog lamps   it costs      nice price   don t you think b options   the    l v   duratec adds    to the xls and    to the xlt and control trac all wheel drive system adds    the xlt model with the v   and all wheel drive automatically gets the    class ii trailer towing package   which ups towing capacity from   pounds to   also available are leather trim   a power glass sunroof   and front side airbags   mach audio system that replaces the in dash cd player with in dash six disc changer the escape is located between classic large suvs and midsize cars   it uses carlike unibody construction and independent suspension   available   wheel drive is   civilaized    i hope   if you want an suv   you will get escape   it handles well   has excellent brakes and lots of cabin space   and the fuel economy is very good i  
1185,1,  the escape is s entry in the popular mini suv class of automobiles   it competes with the nissan xterra   honda crv   toyota rav and a few other suvs   i think has a good thing on its hands and   with a few minor changes   the escape could be a category leader exterior   the escape is the best looking car in its class   it doesn t try to be too adventurous or too athletic   like the xterra with its spoilers and front grills   and yet doesn t look to docile   like the crv   not surprisingly   the escape looks a lot like an explorer   albeit one with updated and refreshed lines   one element that can be improved on the exterior of the escape is the side view mirrors   which shake at highway speeds due to the wind and don t provide a good view of other cars interior   the interior of the escape is generally well thought out   the radio and climate control controls are easy to use and located high up on the middle console   the column mounted gear shifter   however   was placed in an awkward position   it does not shift very well and it obscures a portion of the radio   a better solution would be to place the shifter in between the front passengers like most other suvs   the materials used in the interior could also be improved   the dashboard and doors use cheap looking plastic and the seats are covered by a rough fabric driving   the escape s strongest selling point is its drivability   the escape simply drives as well as any good car   which means that it drives better than most suvs   the escape s steering is very linear and direct and the suv benefits from having a short wheelbase   i was able to maneuver the escape in busy seattle highway traffic with ease   the large windows and upright seating position also allows for good visibility   the v engine   with   hp   provides a lot of power and torque for a car of this size and i was able to accelerate easily in all situations   the main detraction from the driving experience relates to the immense amount of noise that emanates from the road and the engine   the car is so loud on some roads that i had to turn the radio up   should consider fitting the escape with different tires and more sound deadening material for a quieter ride overall   the escape is a reasonably priced small suv that drives more like a car than a truck and seems built from one solid piece   if improves the quality of the interior   including a redesign of the shifter   and makes the escape quieter   this suv will set sales records  
1186,1,  i have just purchased a rhd maverick known as the escape in the u s i need a vehicle that was capable enough to tow my caravan    trailor plus it had to be car like to drive and not like many of the european suv s i e   freelander    discovery which give a choppy ride and certainly do not have all the extra s thrown in as standard   i test drove a    litre auto which i thought was great but here in the u k   petrol at about     a gallon makes this affordable only if money is no object   the only other option was the    litre manual which i opted for and ordered before test driving as the dealer did not have one available   i have had the car   weeks now and it is great    in everyway   easy to handle    park and reverse   excellant driving position    loads of room    plenty of storage and cup holders which are not common here in the u k   but which i think are a must   it tows fine    feels stable although the    litre engine has to work at it   this is the first vehicle of this type i have owned and i don t think i could go back to a normal saloon which i had before   overall great car and as i headed this up a breath of fresh air for us normally stuffy brits  
1187,1,  my wife and i were in the market for a suv and test driving the mini suvs   honda crv   hyundai sante fe   subaru forester to name a few of the vehicles we tested   after the first mile driving the   escape xlt my wife s mind was made up   she was impressed with the visibility   power   and interior room   she was giving up her    mitsubishi diamante for a   wheel drive vehicle   the ride was a little stiffer but not as bad as we expected   the front seats took some time getting used to   but after a few trips we realized that they offer good support and back fatigue after    hours of driving has not been a factor we purchased our escape in oct    and have had one recall notice that did not apply to our vehicle   we ve been averaging    miles per gallon around town and    mpg on the highway   it has been through several snow storms this winter here in ct and has performed admirably   it feels very stable at both highway speed and in bad weather   i m sure the   wheel independent suspension has a lot to do with this   the automatic   wheel drive works amazingly well   one has to try hard to get a wheel to spin on wet as well as snowy roads   the most important factor in our decision to buy this vehicle was that my wife felt completely safe driving it   after a snowy winter she still feels the same we were hoping for a little better gas mileage   but for an suv i guess the mileage we re getting isn t all that bad  
1188,1,  bottom line   i have had my escape for six months and love it the great   a lot of car for the price   roomy interior   decent gas mileage   people crane their necks on the road to check it out the not so great   lots of wind noise on the highway   probably not ideal for true off roading may cause accidents from other drivers admiring it i first purchased my escape last october when i was staring straight into the beginning of another harsh winter and a daily   two hour round trip commute   i needed a vehicle with four wheel drive and did not want to have to resort to selling off body parts to pay for gas   here s some specifics the look   i purchased a light parchment gold escape with the leather interior   the truck looks great inside and out   people are always admiring it   asking about it   and i definitely recommend going with leather if you can afford it   it is comfortable   sharp   and will help hold up the resale value the ride   the car rides very smoothly   however   when you jump on the highway   be prepared to turn the radio up and or talk very loudly with your passengers   the wind noise is pretty bad   this is about the only negative thing i have to say about the car   bells and whistles   while i have a more spartan model   you can   trick out   your escape with moonroof and deluxe sound system   including a six cd changer   i have the standard   single cd system and am very happy with it   shifting into four wheel drive is a snap   and the cruise and wiper controls are of the standard   simple to use variety   the gear shifter is somewhat awkwardly placed and gets in the way of the radio   i have the v model and the fuel economy is decent while still providing plenty of giddyup   you can also get a four cylinder model for increased fuel efficiency   but i have my doubts as to whether that will lend enough power to adequately drive the car for serious off roaders   this probably is not your best option   the escape rides lower than larger suv s and i wouldn t trust it in a true off roading situation  
1189,1,  granted   this is my first suv so i didn t know what to expect   i did my homework with all the suvs out there and knew i wanted a x automatic with a few nice things in it and a few of the standard things i did a lot of comparisons of different suvs   using consumer reports car service   and i always found that the escape was at the top of the list needless to say they were scarce to say the least i was online everyday looking for one   i struck gold one on a tuesday made the deal on saturday i have a soup to nuts xlt with the only thing missing being the side air bags the first and probably the most impressive thing to grab and get your attention is the power this baby has   v   you say to yourself over and over as you fly down the road   with that said and in spite of it s power it s handling is just as impressive   turning on a dime with a suv can you believe it yes you can   the fact that it takes runs on regular gas is simply a joy   call me silly but with the power and performance of that power you would expect premium gas hands down   inside is roomy   the rear seats are easy to maneuver once you get the hang the dash is easy to read and everything is at your fingertips   plenty of storage   big and small convenience   cargo cover and net are a nice touch   an additional v outlet in the rear access to the rear can be done via opening the rear door or opening the glass window and reaching in i dislike the shifter on the steering column   it s very long even though i still find myself grabbing the windshield wiper instead   at night you can t see the shifter so when you reach for the radio cassette cd controls you can   as i have   hit the shifter which scares the living daylights out of you   i have since put a white wrap around it so i can t miss it because of it s power and it s power and power   you do really move   because of this you find yourself in the station often   i think it has a mind of it s own    on the highway mileage is great   on the streets it s chomping at the bit to go but you can t so it seems like it makes you pay for not putting it on the highway a simple thing but the rear window wiper is a bit of wimp it cleans only a small semi circle    you can see out it but for me i wanted more window cleaned  
1190,1,  in the beginning   when we bought or first suv   jeep grand cherokee it worked just fine for us   it was just us and our big yellow labrador   it gave us the right amount of room and comfort that we needed at that time fast forward   three kids later and we still have the lab in   we leased our first excursion   v limited   this was driven daily by my wife to and from school with the kids   if it s acts like a bus   we used it like a bus   she is only    at best   and had no problem driving this truck   not a nick on a bumper in two years   bottom line   it did a great job hauling two strollers   three kids a dog and who ever else needed to go some where   great for vacations too   the long rides to florida down the dreaded route   corridor   all kids learn to hate this ride   we could actually fit all the stuff for vacation without the roof carrier   by the way   really kills gas mileage too   so   another environmentally friendly plus for the big truck   it was actually a pleasure to have enough room to be comfortable all the way down without killing each other   and the fact that it does have a   gallon gas tank is a god send on very long trips   especially when going through states that don t have stations every two miles or when driving through the night when most stations are closed inside   the interior is comfortable enough without being one of those sissy suv s   all i was missing was my remote and i would have been right at home   the sound system is fantastic and the kids love the fact that the windows went all the way down   even with baby seats all have enough room to spread out   a full size cooler fits in the center just behind the front seats making the outer seats usable for passengers   and you still have room for   more in the third row access is better then the gm trucks   the tri door makes access to the rear cargo area simple   the fact that you do not loose the rear wiper as you would on the gm barn door style is a plus   when all seats are removed you can fit   pieces of sheet rock laying down   or one queen size futon in tact towing   don t kid yourself this puppy has neck wrenching torque   i m not sure what the other reviews perception was based upon because   i also own a shelby if this is any indication of knowing torque   look at the towing ratings and you decide   i ve had well over   pounds on the back and boy did it drive like nothing was behind me   enough said about that   this is a great towing truck ride   the long wheel base gives the excursion the ride of a limo    a x limo   because of the length it floats down the road   we definitely notice a better ride in the   then the original    the shocks are not as harsh and it does not bounce around as much as the   did bad roads     and not to mention bad roads   the roads in the state of new jersey kills more cars then bad drivers   statistically this may not be true   but have you ever hit a large pot hole followed by a series of whoop de doos   not something you want to attempt in a non suv   i ve seen these roads tear off wheels   again creating large traffic jams during rush hour   another mass waste of fossil fuel and commuters time    ok that was another stretch   but you get the point city roads   new york city will kill a vehicle just as quickly as a off road baja race   people say   people who buy suv s never take them off road   you do not have to take it off road to have the same experience   try a romp around nyc and see how quick a lesser truck would crumble the torture of the urban roads   if you ever danced fender to fender with a yellow cab you certainly understand why in the city size does matter maintenance   after   months and    miles   oil every    miles   tire rotation after every    miles and that is it   not a problem and never back for any warranty work consolidation is being environmentally friendly   as far as being environmentally friendly   we live in the ny tri state area and during one of the family outing to the bronx zoo we invited another family to come with us   we all fit in the excursion   so what   you may say   well   by car pooling we kept one additional vehicle off the already crowded roads and actually saved resources   it may be a stretch   but none the less   true the bad news   after the   year lease was up and we went back to the dealer   we had every intention of buying the truck back from   well   as luck would have it   the buy back was very high   and they wanted almost     to buy it back   being that it was out of warranty at this point we decided that a nice shiny new   windstar limited was the way to go   it too had all the bells and whistles for family use   video   auto sliding doors   remote start and the tow package   all the features a mom of three could want   life in the minivan   we did a few long road trips to indiana and florida with the windstar   it drove great   but buy were we a little tight   for the extra space that was needed   the roof carrier came out of mothballs again   albeit the gas mileage was better in the mini van   but the need for space was greater snow and bad weather   even with optional traction control it was not the best in the snow   maybe we just got used to the jeep and the excursion s   wheel drive   the excursion    feet of snow and no issues the move   a year and a half into the windstar we decided that we really needed the larger vehicle   so   i waited for the   excursions to roll off the assembly line   this forced the dealers to clear out the   stock   and for the first time it really did work in my favor     financing      off from   smack the dealer around a little more and they will drop another     off   this was great   we had our pick of styles   colors and options sales may be down   but it sure did give me allot of vehicles to choose from we purchased a beautiful black   limited excursion   it is smoother and quitter then the    the fit and finish is much better then the original   the v was great in the first one   so we had no reservations about another v   they are powerful enough to propel a   foot home   they can certainly handle the excursion   although   i would have liked the    diesel the     uplift was a bit much to handle   it really did blow the monthly payment out of the window the competition   we also looked at the suburban and the yukon xl   best kept secret   we got allot more truck for allot less money   the chevy and gmc were over k more and the incentives were not as good   the   platform did not equal the class of the excursion   for it to be apples to apples you would have to buy a   series and load it up   the by far was the better deal   and hey   it s a truck   enough of the commercials   bottom line   the excursion might not be as environmentally friendly as my honda insight   mpg   but   that is my work vehicle that i drive over    miles per year   just as the insight fits my needs during the week   the excursion fits my wife s needs if made a hybrid excursion that got   mpg i d buy it   but they don t   and the excursion suits our lifestyle today my thoughts   great truck   great value   if you can t run with the big boys go to the back of the bus   pun intended this is a great vehicle if you have children   alot of stuff   need to move and tow large and heavy things   not right for everyone   but if you have any of the above needs this vehicle is for you people who don t have children and never owned an excursion should not write about it   very well written review   for a single person who drives a little toyota   try   pounds of cement in the back of your echo   oh yea   that would take    trips   who is being environmentally friendly now   would love to see what you say about the porsche   ps    a note from the wife   i am the primary driver of this truck and i love it   i just wanted to respond to the negative comments written     i am only    and i have never once had a visibility issue or a maneuverability issue   which leads me to believe that the    tall guy who borrowed his bosses truck is a really bad driver   and by the way   even in your best dream   the odyssey doesn t come close to the interior space of an excursion   in response to the couple making the penis jokes    guess what    i don t have a penis     because i am a mother of three   maybe it is you who has the penis envy   and one last thing   the suv s that park too close or take up too much space have nothing to do with the truck   it has everything to do with the inconsiderate driver    which i am not if this makes no sense   read other reviews
1191,1,  the is sharp looking truck and provides a comfortable ride   i t has been great for getting back and forth to work and has been very reliable   however if you want to pass someone the four cylinder engine does not provide enough power to do it without downshifting   and i would always hesitate before trying to pass on an up hill slope   overall the paint seems to be holding up very well as are the factory alloy wheels   braking and handling provide no major complaints if you are looking to do heavy hauling this is not recommended though it should do fine with the   cylinder version   this is going to be a wonderful starter vehicle for my son when he turn sixteen next year  
1192,1,  americans travelling in europe for the first time often have a moment of culture shock when they hail a taxi and a mercedes e class or bmw   series pulls up to the curb   in america   these cars have been icons of intelligence and success for more than a generation   in their homeland they are more likely to be diesel powered taxis designed for durability and low operating cost than ultimate driving machines bred for the autobahn in the late   s tried to beat the germans at their own game   in   they had bet the on the groundbreaking taurus   if you weren t there   it is almost impossible to imagine the impact this car had on the american auto industry   its styling was as cutting edge as any european sedan of the time and it had much more of a european feel than any american sedan made before   it couldn t compete against the european sedans sold here   but wondered if the germans could remake a taxi into a world class sport sedan   could they do it with a car that had won the hearts of conservative middle america that was the challenge that faced the taurus sho throughout its eleven year production run   it was by any objective standard a worthy competitor to the midsize entries from bmw and mercedes   one with a distinctive american accent   but in the end not enough buyers could make the mental leap that this taurus was different than the one their parents had traded in their fairmont or caprice classic for b overview and driving impressions b there were three generations of the sho   the first      was the original     quot jellybean quot   taurus platform with the sho v   and suspension component upgrades   the final version      used the all new   quot oval quot   taurus platform and carried an equally new v    but i don t recommend either   the first generation sho was a great engine mated to a chassis that wasn t intended for it   while the third became so refined it lost much of the distinctive personality in the earlier versions   the sweet spot was the    second generation cars   in   all taurii were redesigned and the sho received distinctive front and rear styling that gave it a crisper   stronger look than the first edition   under the skin several weaknesses and customer complaints had been addressed   and the entire platform was strengthened   giving the sho handling abilities that came closer to matching the germans than any american sedan that came before   and in   it finally got the automatic transmission the pundits said it needed to win over american buyers the heart of the sho was its engine   yamaha was originally hired to design a new cylinder head for the    liter v    the head they came up with produced too much power for the block to live with   so contracted them to come up with an entire powerplant   their answer was a dual overhead cam    valve v   that only shared a three liter displacement with the engine in lesser taurus models   the engine was a marvel   with   horsepower available the sho was the most powerful engine in its class by a slim marging   but it weighed   pounds less than the merc and   pounds less than the bmw   this made the taurus sho the quickest car in its class more important than the numbers was how different the three cars felt in action   the mercedes   from its engine to how the ashtray door closed with a solid but velvet smooth action   felt literally like a bank vault on wheels   the bmw reeked of refinement by drivers   extremely capable yet never feeling like it would lose its composure   both were outstanding cars with clear personalities   but neither   in my book   compared to the shot of tequila and a big slap on the back feeling of the sho   when you got into the gas in the the engine growled   the steering wheel tugged slightly in your hands   then the growl became a roar as the tachometer needle swung quickly towards    rpm   it wasn t crude   in capable hands the sho was a remarkably composed car to drive at speed with little body roll and crisp responses   the sho was simply spicier and more engaging than the germans one of the big reasons to choose a second generation car over a first is the shifter mechanism for the five speed transaxle   first gen sho s used a cable actuated shifter that had all the feel of stirring a pot of warm molasses   starting in    all five speed sho s ditched the spaghetti wires for solid linkage that greatly improved the feel   but it was still notably less precise than the action on the rear wheel drive bmw with its superb five speed   all front wheel drive cars share this handicap compared to a good rear wheel drive setup   torque steer   another bane of powerful front wheel drive cars   could tug the wheel in your hands but you really had to be hamfisted with the throttle to have it effect your driving   as i mentioned earlier   in   the sho got the slushbox   automatic   the critics said the market wanted   the thinking was   as only a relative few bmw s came to america with manual gearboxes and mercedes didn t offer them on any model in the e class   to compete the sho needed an automatic even if the purists had a fit over it   the critics were half right   the automatic didn t make the sho a bestseller but it did improve the feel of driving the car   this is just my personal preference   but in a midsized or larger sedan i prefer an automatic if it is done right   hustling a small light sports car up a road and snapping through shifts is one of life s greater joys   but a    pound sedan is more enjoyable when the strategy is smoothness and forethought   and a good automatic is better partnered to this style of driving   in the sho it was no contest in my book   the automatic was a better automatic than the manual was manual   huh   while the manual was improved in     it still had an imprecision that hindered finding a gear instinctively   the automatic was better mated to the sho   with crisp   smooth upshifts that matched the sporting personality of the car   and the effect of torque steer was greatly reduced compared to the manual   unless you are the kind of enthusiast who can t have any sports car with an automatic   the auto is a better way to go if the taurus was a bargain bmw   as reviewers and fans called it   it hid the trimmed corners well   i don t know how made a dime on them   i prepped new cars and did trim nvh repairs at a large dealer in    and quickly noticed that a loaded out taurus lx was only a couple of thousand dollars less than a sho   fully equipped   with leather   excellent power sport seats   full power accessories   power glass moonroof   premium   jbl   sound   cd and the automatic the sticker came in at less than      the e   and i weighed in at almost twice that fifty large in the same trim   it s the greatest price disparity between similar cars that i ve ever seen b reliability and maintenance b against all bets when it was in production   the second generation sho has proven itself a remarkably durable car   only three big dollar problem areas have been uncovered on the second generation cars   sho s driven in the snowbelt during winter have been known to develop corrosion in the engine subframe   it s not a fatal problem   the subframe can be replaced for a few hundred dollars   including labor   the front brakes are another consistent source of trouble   the second generation cars were slightly better but simply put rotors on the car that were too small to stand up to the punishment of a high performance sports sedan   the rotors get too hot and warp when used hard   and like most cars made in the last decade only included enough metal on the them to have them machined and trued once    maybe   if you were lucky and caught it soon enough   finally   for all the initial concern about funneling   lb ft of torque through a front wheel drive transaxle   the only weak link has been the clutch in the manual transmission models   the brake and clutch problems can be cured with the right application of high performance parts   and the engine subframe is a job that should be good for several years   all in all   not a bad list of   quot major quot   problem areas for a high performance car    and by contrast   the second generation base taurus models have earned a lemon reputation for blowing head gaskets in their    liter engines and eating their axod e transaxles the sho models shared no engine parts with the base models and used specially modified transmissions that have proven very durable   can anyone think of another high performance engine transmission that is more reliable than the base model one problem area that isn t unique to the sho but needs to be mentioned is the importance of keeping the thermostat and catalytic converters in good condition   if the thermostat sticks open the engine won t overheat   but something just as bad can happen   all fuel injected engines use the engine temperature as one of the major factors to determine the air fuel mixture   if the engine is running too cold   as it will when the thermostat is stuck open   the mixture will be too rich   but instead of this unburned fuel vapor pouring out the tailpipe and creating smog   it is ignited and burned in the cat   which gets much hotter than it was designed to be and begins to break apart inside   it s not a problem until you lift off the gas from a higher engine speed   like when getting off the freeway   when you do this the airflow through the engine reverses momentarily and because the cats on the sho are mounted close to the engine if there is any debris in the cat it can be sucked back into the engine   it is just a destructive as pouring metal shavings in the intake   all four areas should be checked out before buying a sho   the yamaha engine has proven to be as tough as granite   aside from possible valve guide wear in hard driven cars there haven t been any major problems with the engine at all    look for a little blue smoke at a cold startup   hard starting   or oil consumption greater than a quart every   miles   like most of their motorcycle engines   the sho does not have hydraulic valve adjustors so the clearance has to be set by a mechanic   but unlike a bike it s not a regular occurrence   specifies a major service between    and    miles that includes a valve adjustment and replacing the engine timing belt   spark plug wires and control arm bushings   it is a major bill   but nothing compared to the expense of failure if something like the timing belt lets go   and this service on the sho will cost a fraction of the same service expenses on a bmw or mercedes as the miles reach this territory    one note   the sho   like any vehicle with an all aluminium engine   should have the coolant system flushed and replaced every year other problems fall into the nitpick category   in looking through the newsgroup boards   i was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the problems owners are reporting after five years are the same ones i saw when the cars were still under warranty   most involving interior trim parts   is my relief confusing   while the lumbar support leaking and the wiper control on the turn signal stalk failing too soon is evidence that there were some areas where missed the mark in design and manufacture   after five to seven years i expected to see new problems emerging as the cars piled up the miles and that hasn t been the case   the good news is   the owner groups have developed inexpensive solutions for all the interior problems if you have a little mechanical ability with one exception   if you notice the driver seat rocks when you sit down or move the only fix is replacing the power mechanism   a bracket with the adjustor motors and trays that move the seat   it s not a safety hazard the seat is still firmly attached to the floor   but if you want to repair it plan on laying out about    for a new power mechanism    pricing and owner support b the discovery of the enthusiast and aftermarket support on the web for the sho has been another pleasant surprise   there are regional sho owner clubs across america and a strong aftermarket for replacement and high performance parts    note to gearheads   the level of aftermarket support for the v   sho is as good as you ll find for a camaro or   at extremely affordable prices for this class   too   along with continued parts support from   the sho is one of the rare limited edition models that hasn t become an orphan in retirement   but it does remain one of the best values in the entire automotive market   the kelly blue book quotes a     retail price for a    sho automatic with    miles in my area   like when it was new that is almost exactly half the blue book for a i or e    but in my area that would buy you an immaculate car   in the last year i ve seen close to a dozen very clean    sho s with prices in the     range   and because most sho buyers weren t testosterone poisoned young adults   read camaro market   the chances of finding a well maintained and cared for car are very good b conclusion b a sho has been on my list of cars to have since i worked on them at earnhardt   it s a terrific sports sedan at an econobox price that has held up remarkably well   and the mad scientist in me still gets an evil grin when i think about the things i wanted to do with it    and that was when i only imagine stripping all the power amenities and losing a quick    pounds just on the interior   now i can get superchargers that make up to    horsepower i   bottom line   as an entertaining and unique sport sedan to be appreciated for what created   or as the platform for a midlife crisis   the sho is impossible to beat   it was one of the most easily overlooked cars when it was new   and today it has become a hidden treasure for enthusiasts   and if a bimmer owner scoffs   as they are wo nt to do   just ask how he likes his taxi     brian igo   i the source for everything you ever wanted to know about the sho   and one of the best auto fan sites i ve seen on the web   is   shotimes    this is an indispensable resource for sho owners   all of the diy cheap fixes i mentioned in passing are there   along with an excellent reference on troubleshooting literally dozens of different conditions and great how to instructions for maintenance this may be hazardous to your wealth   but   shoshop   is a wonderful and highly recommended source for replacement and aftermarket sho parts   excellent stuff at reasonable prices   and the best designed website i ve seen for a speedshop i br br  
1193,1,  i have owned my taurus for   years and i put about    miles on it in those   years   i have been very happy with the car in all aspects except road noise   the weatherstripping on the windows seems to make a lot of noise   if you play the radio at average volume you don t seem to hear it   but when the radio isn t on   it seems kind of loud   the ride is great   both front and back seats   you can easily sleep in the back seat on road trips   there is plenty of room for the family up front   and the luggage in the trunk   the acceleration is also very good for a   quot family quot   car   as you can make passes safely   common repairs are average in cost   brakes tires oil changes   but i have priced some other parts that seemed a little high   rotors    alternator    these seem about double what the average part might cost   fortunately i haven t had to replace these parts   but it is something to keep in mind when buying this type of car overall the   taurus is a great family with pretty much everything i have expected from this car   if they would fix the road noise it could be almost perfect br br  
1194,1,  i purchased a   taurus a few years back and was impressed with the ride and comfort coupled with it s gas mileage   i was a little disappointed with the power thus decided to make that a priority with my next automobile   when i decided to sell   i purchased a   taurus gl to take it s place   the gl is obviously of better quality than the plain one   both automobiles were are top performers   the power and performances of this type of automobile   along with it s durability and low maintenance is tops   this automobile can certainly take what is dished out   excellent quality and exquisite ride make this a most desireable car   i prefer the body style and unique design of the    model over today s version   i prefer the unique designs that set apart from the obvious   when design unites with quality performance then that is one unique drive   the sport design catches the attention of the youth in all of us   yet the roominess and comfort interests the adult in us   and the quality and durability satisfies all the taurus has been first on the race track until nascar made them slow it down where the other cars could keep up   they ve slowed it down six miles an hour   this is one top performing automobile br br  
1195,1,  when i first heard my husband say taurus   i said quot no way   that s a granny car quot   and at   i didn t want a granny car   well   i decided to look at and drive the   model and fell in love   it has all the nice features of a more expensive car power windows and door locks   tilt   cruise   keyless entry   etc   but it was actually affordable i have been driving this car for     years now and plan on driving the wheels off   and this from a person that had traded vehicles every year for the past   years i had a truck   sports car and a mini van   but will stick with the taurus from now on   will probably buy a new one when this one goes out   the only problem i have is the doors automatically lock if the car is running   but with the keyless entry   that is not really a big deal i would recommend to any family looking for a good car for their money br br  
1196,1,  we traded in our saturn sedan for a taurus because we needed more space for our baby   the taurus is an excellent family car with plenty of room inside and in the trunk   so far we have had no major engine or system trouble and we ve had the taurus for   years   the air conditioning and heating provide excellent climate control and the stock stereo is good for everyday listening the brakes ignition switch has come unconnected twice since we ve had the car and has had to be pushed back in by hand   there isn t a lot of leg room in the back seat for passengers with long legs     
1197,1,  the taurus is a great car for young or old   i didn t want to by it by name    but when i sat in it and test drove it   it was quick for me to change my opinion   when i found out the facts about the taurus i was pretty impressive   the safety on the car was excellent   a lot lower to insure than other cars   it drove real good and had lots of peep   there wasn t to much i didn t like about the car   it at more gas than my old four cylinder engine   but not much   and it sure out powered it   this is a great overall car with class   and is a car four just about anyone   
1198,1,  full review taurus sel   nobull   the taurus sel wagon   is an example that a car manufacturer can put out a vehicle that will surpass government recommended safety standards and still be a very attractive and stylish automobile   ever since a coworker bought a taurus wagon and rode in it   i always have been very impressed by this car   i thought that not only it looked very nice on the exterior but also that the interior was very practical   stylish and comfortable   has equipped the   taurus with a series of safety features that makes it one of the safest cars on the road   some of the safety features includes dual stage front air bags   crash severity sensor   safety belt pre tensioners   safety belt energy management retractors   safety belt usage sensors and driver seat position sensor   with all those innovative safety features it is no wonder that the us government has giving the taurus a five star crash test rating   the highest mark a car can receive for crash test safety testing   the newly design cabin will give occupants an added two inches in rear seat headroom and a full inch in front seat headroom   the front seats are very comfortable even more on the driver side   which is equipped with a six way power driver s seat adjustment including a very good and appreciated manual lumbar adjustment   the interior of the car i drove had a very beautiful and stylish color combination   the seats and door panels were creme with medium dark grey dashboard and trims and the carpet was a light brown   the color scheme really looked smart and was very pleasing to the eyes   the taurus wagon can sit   passengers so claims   but if you are thinking of   adults you will be stuffed in like sardines   once you open up the fold down rear seats   you have no more room for cargo   i did feel that for a station wagon even with that rear seat down you had very little space for luggage and equipment   the exterior of   taurus wagon has very beautiful lines and all its components are very proportionate to each other s   the color of the car i test drove was an eye catching harvest gold protected with a metallic clearcoat   one things i liked is how high the rear gate opens to allow you to load the cargo   this will definitely helps preventing people from banging their head on the rear gate   the   taurus wagon is a real pleasure to drive either within city limits or on the high roads   i had the opportunity to drive it on an extended trip on one of upstate new york most scenic highway   the ride was excellent and the scenery was breathtaking   i really appreciated how well the taurus wagon hugged the road and how comfortable you are it this car   the taurus sel wagon comes equipped with   wheel disc brakes anti lock system and a new electronic brake distribution system mounted on a power adjustable brake and accelerator kit which makes it easy to find the proper way to adjust the pedals and seat to the driver s choice   n the taurus sel wagon i drove was equipped with a v dohc   valve    liters   the transmission is an electronic   speed automatic overdrive   it had a   wheel discs   anti lock system   the sitting capacity is for   passengers and the cargo volume is   cubic feet   driving the taurus sel wagon was a real charm   i went for a drive on some of the most scenic roads in north america and what a sight with the fall foliage turning from green to red   brown and gold and this beautiful gold automobile simply faded in with the natural decor  
1199,1,  we ve had our   taurus sel for about   months   and have driven it about   miles   with no unscheduled maintenance   our taurus cost us     without rebates and tax licensing fees applied   it is chockfull with options   everything from abs   traction control to illuminated visors   electronic climate control    valve    l duratec engine   to leather seating and illuminated perimeter lighting systems   to name a few   we continue to be impressed by its road manners   comfort   ambience and thoughtfully laid out interior   though some door panels are of lower quality   the price point compensates greatly for the shortcomings   a similiarly equipped   camry would have set us back atleast      minus the rebates   of which there arnt many   overall   brakes    good   could be a tad better   transmission    excellent   value   excellent   and the overall identity of the taurus is excellent we d definitely recommend a taurus   particularly because of the outstanding customer service we ve received at the customer relationship center        and because of the overall quality   performance and comfort of this vehicle  
1200,1,  i was in the market for a new van and i checked out all the mini vans that are out there   i also began to look at the full size vans   i found that i could purchase a brand new e   van conversion for about the same amount as the mini van   the features in the mini van didn t even compare to the amenities that were available in the van conversion   i got leather seats    captain chairs and a bench seat in the back that lowers with the push of a button into a full size bed   i also have a tv   vcr   game port   to plug in the nintendo   and several power ports   we recently took our family of   on a road trip for   weeks   we plugged in an electric cooler into one of the power ports and the laptop computer into another power port   the kids didn t fight because they each had their own seat and no one had to touch anyone else   they watched movies   played educational games on the laptop   played the regular games that nintendo has to offer   slept when they wanted to   etc   this is the ultimate family travel vehicle   i also drive the van as my everyday vehicle and love it   i am bigger than most cars on the road   and taller so i see things further ahead of me   i feel safer and the little extra that i spend on gasoline to run a larger van is well worth the cost   if you are considering a van conversion for your family    i highly recommend the e   br br  
1201,1,  we have an    econoline van for personal use   and have had   club wagons over the past few years for transporting our   foster children   our    is like a tank   it is kind of ugly too   but that thing just keeps on ticking   we had to replace the transmission recently at a cost of approx      we went ahead and replaced it since it is the only problem we have ever had from the van   it does not have the best gas milege   which is hard with these high gas prices   but it does have   tanks which helps sot hat you do not have to constantly stop for gas also the shades in the windows have rotted   i wish they had been made with a better quality fabric we have had a        clubwagons that took a beating and kept on going   we averaged    miles a year   the only major problem we had was that the brakes did not last as long as they really should have   the interior stayed nice even with   kids on board most of the time br br  
1202,1,  last spring   i needed to trade in my rear wheel drive   explorer sport for a four wheel drive or front wheel drive vehicle since i was in the process of moving to a cold weather climate   if i d moved to a warmer climate or remained in virginia   i would not have parted with my explorer because it was such a great vehicle and had been easy to maintain   and it was paid off my husband and i decided that i should look at suvs exclusively because having one in the family allows us to do partial do it yourself moves for which the government will pay us for the amount of household goods we move ourselves   rather than the commercial moving contracted to move the bulk of our things   it s like getting a bonus for bringing along the luggage and essentials that we d take with us anyway   also   my husband was very insistent that i continue to drive an suv for safety reasons   i began test driving suvs and looking around for potential replacements   in the process   i drove a nissan pathfinder   a nissan exterra   a escape   a   door xlt explorer   a mazda liberty   a mercury mountaineer   all new   and various used models   including a   explorer   since neither of us wanted to shell out      for a new suv   a used vehicle was more within our budget   in all of my test driving experiments   i found that i liked best the handling and turning radius of my   explorer and the other explorers i test drove and decided that i would be happiest with another explorer and narrowed my search accordingly on april    i purchased a white      door xlt explorer   this particular vehicle had been a rental car   auctioned off after a year   still under the manufacturer s warranty   and had nearly    miles on it   in the seven months i ve owned the vehicle   i ve put another    miles on it with moving from virginia to new england   going back for our wedding   and various trips between my duty station and my husband s on the weekends as well as regular day to day use b gas mileage   the   model i purchased gets slightly worse gas mileage than the   sport i owned   the   explorer had a standard transmission and was about a foot smaller without the additional passenger doors   my gas mileage hovers around mpg in town and mpg on the highway   since i have less of a commute   my fuel costs have gone down significantly   rather than up   however   this is not a fuel efficient vehicle b features   i safety features    the   explorer xlt has anti lock brakes and dual front seat airbags   the vehicle comes equipped with a remote keyless entry system and an anti theft system   the ignition key has a chip inside it so that the vehicle can not be started except with the ignition key   or by a really good professional car thief   the driver s side door also has a keypad so that if i lock the keys in the car   i can punch in the code to open the driver s door only and retrieve the keys   i ve found this feature very useful when i want to go running   i lock the house keys in the car   run   and unlock the car using the keypad so i m not carrying keys with me   or losing them   while i exercise   the remote keyless entry system unlocks the driver s side door with one touch   with two touches   it unlocks the rest of the vehicles   i like this feature because i can control unlocking the doors independent of each other   by only unlocking the driver s door   i can jump in and lock that door quickly   possibly preventing an assailant from getting into the car through another door   the windows have a lock feature controlled by the driver which has come in handy   during our drive from virginia to new york   we allowed the cats out of their crates   as they wandered around the interior of the vehicle   one of my cats stepped on the window control of one of the back passenger doors and the window began to roll down   i immediately flipped on the lock and rolled the window back up so that my cat wouldn t get any bright ideas about jumping out of the car at mph   i believe this feature will also come in handy when i have children in the car i cool gadgets    the   explorer has a cd player in the dash   as well as cassette and an am fm radio   the vehicle came equipped with cruise control   air conditioning   rear air conditioning   which my cats and other passengers appreciate   two visors each for the driver and front passenger seats   spare tire mounted underneath   lots of cargo space   about a foot more than the explorer sport   six way adjustable driver s seat with tilted steering wheel   power locks   windows and mirrors   two cup holders in the console that accommodate different sizes of drink containers   and an extra charging outlet that my husband uses for his palm   the overhead compartment for sunglasses is too small for the case   but too rough to put my sunglasses in   the temperature feature is nice   but i find the compass fairly useless and could do without it   i opted for a vehicle with cloth seats instead of leather because i find leather to be sticky in the summertime and too cold in the winter    repairs and maintenance   unlike my   explorer   i ve taken the   explorer to a dealership twice and had it repaired under the warranty    i did not purchase the additional warranty since my last explorer was so reliable and the manufacturer s warranty on this vehicle is good until december    the first repair was for the back window wiper   at first it worked   but sporadically   and eventually quit working at all   the was burned out and replaced   i noticed that i had to ensure that the wiper is properly positioned after opening and closing the cargo window   which can be opened independently of the cargo door   the wiper is positioned so that it sometimes gets trapped when the window closes   i m fairly sure that the wiper was trapped and various rental car drivers would turn on the rear wiper and just leave it on   burning out the even when the wiper wasn t working the second time i took the explorer in because the abs light came on when i started the vehicle and stayed on   indicating that the anti lock brake system had disabled itself because of a problem   my assumption was correct   and the service department made the necessary adjustments to the brakes that had caused the abs to disable itself   like the   explorer   the   explorer has all the owner operator parts marked in yellow   the oil dipstick   the battery   the various liquid wells   i ve had the oil changed once since purchase and it s due again   at the oil change   no other repairs or maintenance were needed other than the oil was a quart low when i brought it in i am slightly annoyed that i had to bring the vehicle into the dealership for service at all   since i did not once use the warranty on my first explorer   but the repairs were free so i can t complain too loudly b handling   as i stated above   i kept coming back to the explorer because it handled so much better than the other suvs i test drove   even the slightly longer   door model   while driving an suv statistically protects you more in accidents   i see suv drivers all the time flouting the road conditions and driving like maniacs   newsflash people   an suv will protect one more in an accident   but isn t it better to not be in an accident in the first place   if the road conditions are hazardous due to snow or rain   driving an suv does not give one license to continue to drive at mph when everyone else is going mph   the high speeds in bad weather conditions not only endangers oneself and one s passengers   it also endangers the other drivers on the road who have more respect for the necessity of slowing down in bad weather   my other rant concerns the stability of the explorer   the vehicle does have a higher center of gravity than a car or some of the smaller suvs   driving an suv requires some adjustments   one often has to take curves more slowly so that the vehicle won t tip over   the explorer is very stable   if one drives it keeping in mind the higher center of gravity   if you think you re a racecar or stunt driver   this is not the vehicle for you b cost   with my trade in and some bargaining   i paid just under     for my used   explorer   which actually worked out to a little bit more than what i paid for my new   explorer   the   explorer   at the time of purchase in my area   had a kelley blue book retail value of approximately      so i felt like i got a good deal   of course   the dealership low balled the trade in value of my explorer   but i bargained them down to the price range i wanted        i have a theory about why dealerships low ball trade ins   the consumer pays the sales tax on the new car   if the buyer trades in a car   the purchase price is lowered accordingly and the buyer pays sales tax on that price   the dealership   however   would have to pay sales tax on the used trade in   i assume   to pass that sales tax along to the buyer   the dealership tries to get the used car price as low as possible to reduce their tax while the buyer has to pay more in sales tax on the new car   since i am a service member with residency in nevada   i don t have to pay sales tax when i buy a car so the amount i got for my trade in mattered very little to me as long as i got the overall price i wanted   this is not the case for most car buyers   if you know why dealerships low ball the trade in values   please satisfy my curiosity and leave a comment b overall   i highly recommend the   explorer xlt   the standard items are very convenient and easy to use   the vehicle is easy to maintain   i have plenty of cargo room for moving    pounds of my things   or even waiving furniture delivery fees and transporting pieces of furniture home myself   i love this explorer almost as much as i loved my first one  
1203,1,  my husband   amp   i recently bought a explorer after much research   amp   study   we decided on a sports utility   amp   then had to decide which one   we had many times driven or been in my father in law s expedition   this was out of our price range   but we liked what it had to offer   we found that the explorer had many of those same options that we like so much in the expedition in our price range   the explorer is the biggest suv in it s class    it s considered to be in the small sport s utility class   we have loved our suv ever since   one of the things that we noticed when searching for a sports utility was that some of the   wheel drive suv s have rear wheel instead of front wheel drive   we decided against the honda passport for this very reason   the explorer   wheel drive does have front wheel drive   this is a very important feature if you live in a hilly or snow prone areas   if you live in california   though   it may not be that important to you the higher insurance we now have because we re driving a sports utility isn t a great feature   however   it s still comparatively lower than the insurance cost for other suv s   overall   the explorer is the best buy in its class     
1204,1,  in a time when suvs are getting bigger and bigger   excursion   suburban   etc   the explorer sport stands out as a quality vehicle   not only relative to size   but also overall   it is loaded to the gills with features   with the top of the line models still costing less than      this car is available in manual   or for just an extra thousand dollars   automatic   it packs a huge v   standard   or an optional v   under its tiny hood   because of a shorter wheelbase   all this power is very easy to control   even with the two door design   there is still room for two passengers to sit comfortably in the back seat   which can be folded down to accommodate skis or other large packages   this car is a great winter vehicle   but if you want to go skiing in it   you may run into problems trying to store longer skis in the back   however   the car is short enough that one can easily access a ski rack on the roof   this another benefit of the sport over other suv behemoths on the road today   on the inside   various packages can get you a high end mach audio system with a six disc cd changer   even without this   the second level stereo still has am fm   cassette deck   and a single cd player   there are several auxilery powerpoints for numerous electronics   it comes with standard ac and heat   both in the front and back seats   there is an extra power door lock by the back gate   so that you can lock the doors after taking stuff out of the back   the car has great handling for an suv   due to its smaller size   the four wheel drive is easy to use   and results in very little loss of control   this is a great winter car   especially for a young driver   which is the type of person that i would strongly recommend this car for   it handles well in tough conditions   which is very helpful   plus it is not too large   and it is very affordable   so   if you are looking into a x for a new driver   or buying your first   i would definitely recommend the explorer sport     
1205,1,  we bought our first explorer   a    we were admittedly naive in the suv buying field   it was our first suv purchase   and we were young enough to go for the best   deal    read   cheapest   suv for sale   unfortunately   the dealership we dealt with was not the most reputable and hid some of the problems temporarily until the warranty exchange period had expired   subsequently   we drove an explorer with bad lifters   anyone who s ever been in that situation can tell you how embarrassing it was to drive around in a car that clicked loudly   causing people to make comments to us about oil changes and vehicle maintenance   and eventually had the engine rebuilt   after this experience and the bellyaching our family and friends heard for over three years   everyone was surprised when we traded it in for a new   model    why i   they asked    would you put yourselves through this when you just fixed the last one i   there were simply too many good features on explorers that we loved to not own one   plus we knew from talking to mechanic friends that the engineering and quality had improved in later models   our family camps frequently   so the extra space offered by suv s is a must have    why not get a mini van i   you might ask   living in michigan with a difficult to plow driveway and the winter precipitation plus camping in rural areas only accessible via very rough two track areas   we ve learned that an suv is an excellent choice for our situation   it s not just about the looks   although we do like the sleek design   but just as much about function   also   i play keyboards and will frequently haul a large load of equipment   so secure   sheltered space is definitely a need for us   i ve owned a pickup in the past and prefer an suv for this purpose   plus we can have more passengers along with the equipment knowing what we liked in an suv   we shopped around the suv market and eventually decided on another explorer for many different reason   we ended up leasing a   explorer xls with a v   automatic transmission   and lots of nice features b convenience features   in addition to standard power locks   there is another lock unlock switch located just inside the opening rear window   nice feature   this allows you to lock the vehicle after retrieving   one last thing   from the cargo storage area without opening one of the front doors   it s very convenient and a great idea from the folks at the power windows are   well   powerful   the rear doors of the vehicle now each contain a suction cup once attached to childrens   window shades   swallowed up after i had rolled down the window   forgetting the shades were installed   driver s window automatically rolls down with extra pressure on the switch   but rolling it up requires holding down the switch through completion   also   the driver has a window lock switch to prevent any of the other passengers from playing with the windows   nice for kid safety   bad for a spouse that has angered the driver   privacy glass is a nice option   all windows with the exception of windshield and front seat windows are tinted nice and dark   not quite limo tint but enough to make anyone in the rear comfortable in a late afternoon driving session   the tint is good quality   has not scratched or faded at all running boards came with our vehicle   although not necessary for us they are nice for older people who join us   the boards are usable by both front and rear seat passengers   they are very heavy duty   as our salesman can attest   he once had a   pound local athlete jump up and down on the bars without causing any sort of damage the air conditioning works wonderfully and is very cold when you want it to be   one complaint   however   is that the output for a c is not adjustable   it will only be forced out the vents blowing directly on your face   it would be nice to adjust where the a c blows   the heater works just as well   and in bone chilling michigan winters it heats up quickly without having to start the engine five minutes before leaving the house cruise control works remarkably well   maintaining your chosen speed regardless of weather or incline situations you might be experiencing   it is   of course   easy to operate   incorporating the standard buttons which are snuggled up to the airbag area on both sides of the wheel standard delay feature on the windshield wipers applies   although i m somewhat disappointed to see that a mist feature has not been added   to sweep the windshield only once   the wipers must actually be turned on then quickly turned off   this   i imagine   adds extra wear and tear to the control   versus having a   mist   function that can be tapped to sweep the windshield once or twice the tilt steering wheel is also equipped   i have nothing remarkable to say about this   it tilts the steering wheel   not too technical here as part of the vehicle that we purchased   we have the towing option   this means that there is a wiring kit provided to hook up to a trailer when you want to tow it   to be honest   we have not used this feature yet   although we are planning to use it this summer to tow a small pop up camper   we need to get a hitch installed first   the rear window is equipped with a wiper that has a two or three delay settings plus it squirts windshield washer fluid   two complaints here     after a while   the wiper only now cleans a portion of the area it once used to   it leaves a large gap toward the top of the window     the control is located on the other side of the stereo    it needs to be located closer to the other controls   because it is quite a reach when you re trying to concentrate on driving in weather in which the rear wiper is needed the stereo is quite nice   a cd cassette combo unit with six nice large preset buttons to eliminate a lot of groping and fumbling while watching the road   it is easy to operate and sounds nice   also it has a mute button for when you are on the phone   although personally i don t use the phone while driving    i ignore it or pull off the road   i can t concentrate on too many things at once   a roof rack tops off our sleek black suv   it s only been used once   carting a live christmas tree from store to home   it s unremarkable   but nice when you need it   there are four adjustable little rope loop things in addition to the two cross bars   this was nice when tying the tree on the top we have the fog lamp option   which is really nice when driving at night because it illuminates the side of the road very well without disturbing other drivers   especially nice in our area because deer making a go at crossing the road at midnight are much more easily seen than without these lights b safety features   in addition to dual front impact airbags   side curtain airbags are included for the front passengers   the airbags are actually stored in the outside of the front seats   on the sides   facing the doors   on side impact   these airbags will be there to shield you from the side window   or from the side windows shattering into your face   fortunately we have never had any accidents in the vehicle so i can t tell you how well the airbags work   the four wheel anti lock braking system   abs   is installed also   this is a nice safety feature so you don t go skidding out of control by slamming the brakes b repair record   so far   this vehicle has needed only a few very minor repairs since we took delivery nearly    miles ago   an oil pressure sensor was replaced   and a seat belt assembly   factory recall   there have been no major mechanical or drive train failures so far b grievances   the one negative part of the vehicle on my list is the interior   the cover for the jack   located on the left wall of the storage cargo area   comes loose   does not open   when driving and sometimes makes noises with road vibration   also   the interior door handles seem to be cheap   the frame around the handle on the driver s door has gone crooked   also the rear passenger handle does not seem to be able to open the door   but it is stuck partially out   i checked the child safety latch and that did not seem to be the cause   currently this is on the list to be checked out during our next visit to the dealership   for maintenance b reliability   with the extreme variances of weather we experience   we have never encountered a problem with starting or operating the vehicle   it has been very reliable car b summary   this is a great vehicle for all our needs and uses   it is very comfortable for long trips and fits us perfectly   overall   we are very happy with the car   we are planning on purchasing it at the end of the lease period and look forward to many more years of enjoyment for leisure   business and hauling around the kids  
1206,1,  this xmas my wife took me to the dealer to see a vehicle   a lot of our friends own and drive explorers and we have heard many good things about it but to tell the truth   i wasn t too thrilled   that was the rd of december   today i have owned an explorer for   weeks and i can tell you that i am nothing but pleased   it is everything our friends had said about it and more   we bought the explorer xls four door   it is roomy   you ride very high and it gives you a great view of the road   the ride is smooth and it handles very well   the     price tag   includes a c   stereo w cd   running boards   luggage rack   and luxury wheels   the gas mileage is very good   especially for a vehicle this size   and the engine has lots of pep   up to now   all i can find that is not to my liking is that it idles a wee bit rough for a new car   i test drove others and they all did the same   overall   i feel that we got a lot of value for our money and would surely recommend that anyone thinking about buying a new car take a serious look at the explorer br br  
1207,1,  the explorer was one of the best investments i have ever made   that stuff that people say about a car flipping over isn t true with this suv   you feel safe when you re behind the wheel   the car rides smooth and is great for long trips with lots of cargo space   i ve owned this vehicle for   months and have had slight problems   this car really hasn t had any problems   and it s reliable   but the minor problems were both fixed by the because of the    mile warranty   the is fair and honest   and they really know how to treat a customer   also   my car has been hit four times when it was parked somewhere   it has survived all four instances without even receiving a scratch   i may just be lucky   but i would say that the car is built to protect the driver   i would recommend this vehicle to anyone who loves to drive because it is great for road trips or just cruisin   around town   it is definitely an awesome buy     
1208,1,  i m considering starting an on line explorer club   do you think there is interest   i see many such clubs on the web for mustangs   camaros   eclipses etc   there seems to be as many explorers out there as anything so i think there could be a need for this   i will be contacting to get their support and approval   my idea is to have a free membership where people can enroll and submit the latest news   information and developments regarding their vehicle   e mail me if your interested at kevincwgordon yahoo    if i get a good response i will start work on the site over the holidays     
1209,1,  currently own dark wedgewood   eddie bauer edition    x    i am impressed with the fit and finish of the interior   and the convenience items   most impressive is the note recorder and garage door opener on the sunvisor   what a surprise and delight when i discovered this feature   very useful   the acceleration is very good at the bottom end while not so impressive at the top end   the automatic   wheel drive feature is also very useful   it just switches to   wheel drive when you need it   the vehicle is very stable and comfortable at higher speeds unlike previous year models i have owned   while the styling is a little long in the tooth   i still like the current design   looks very sporty and strong   i personally like the size   just right   i had an expedition before and found it to be a little big   i would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a very good looking   stable   and roomy suv br br

1211,1,  what can i say other than wow   this really is one of the greatest vehicles on the market today   the explorer has great handling and rides very smoothly   the inner portion of the explorer has more than plenty of room to allow you to drive with the utmost comfort   i would definately recommend this vehicle to anyone   the explorer is a highly reliable suv sport utility vehicle   the only downside that this vehicle has is that it eats gas   but then again what suv doesn t   i would also recommend the expedition and the explorer sport as highly efficient vehicles   if you are a person who just absolutely loves sport utility vehicles   then this is the one for you br br  
1212,1,  some history i have always been a boy   had an   broncoii   still have a   broncoii   stills runs great with   k showing and is my current hunting wagon   so my experience with supposedly easy to tip over suv s runs deep   and thankfully so far i have not had any of the feared rollovers   i purchased this gem in    for   k    a steal in my opinion one bit of advice for suv wannabees   don t buy this vehicle or any other suv if you are prone to radical highway driving or are prone to being distracted by chatting on cell phones with lovers   or using such fine vehicles as a dressing room while driving and especially if you prefer to drink while driving   don t buy a fine vehicle like this   if you do buy it keep both hands on wheel and treat it with the respect which it deserves now the details   mine is the door e   bauer with all the gizmos   leather   data display   digital memo   overhead console   rear sound system   rear a c control   keyless entry alarm   puddle lites   xenon lighting    firestone s   yes i trust em still   but i am on the list for replacement with michelin crossterrain just getting some mileage out of the firestones first almost k so far on them   also have the roof rack and trailer package and electric everything   the only option   i think   not on this gem is the power moonroof and to be honest i don t miss it   i had one on the broncoii and after a few years it began to have a persistent leak in rainstorms so if you keep vehicles longterm like i do skip the moonroof and eliminate the rainstorm possibility   my likes are many and dislikes are nil in the winter the heating system is fast and strong in summer the a c is just as fast and strong   road feel and comfort in the explorer are vastly improved over my   broncoii as well as power and towing capability   and when it snows i smile knowing that this beast eats snow for a living   one thing my broncoii has over the explorer is its capability off road the   had manual   speed with manual locking hubs and shorter wheelbase and was lighter as well   with its    v the broncoii could run circles around the explorer on a muddy goat track   however in the explorers defense i did recently travel   with two gals on board with all the camping equipment and luggage etc   to the boardman river in the per marquette national forest in northern lower michigan we were definitely up a goat track more than    miles to the river bank where we set up camp   and let me tell you this transport tank explorer did not even flinch   surefooted and comfortable all the way with   disc cd changer to boot   how civilized a way to off road   way to go technical my    sohc v   delivers and average mpg fairly consistently   i live on a dirt road in howell mi and travel roughly    of the time on highway   so far   after    miles i have had no repairs of any kind no rattles no wind noises nothing but joy and bliss   i do all my own maintenance and i made sure to get the complete shop manual   book set tossed in when i purchased it from   in the near term it looks as tho the brake pads will need to be replaced    k miles not bad at all   and i may even upgrade shocks and toss in a tweaked computer chip to upgrade the standing start performance   as noted by many the explorer has adequate power for passing its off the line performance is a bit dull but hey   its a truck   whattaya want   other than that i change the oil more frequently than the k interval and i check the tranny fluid levels almost whenever i check oil   also i stay away from automated car washes preferring to powerwash myself and i frequently do   clean cars do nt rust proof is my   broncoii i look forward to reporting back when this stallion hits    miles if you want a recommendation jeep grand wagoneers have cramped foot space on both left and right front cowls   they have more road noise and just don t compare on interior or exterior appointments but they aren t jeeps anymore since they are technically a chrysler product durangos   just plain cheap feel   gm blazer jimmy   bravada whatever   all the same tinny under powered rattling pieces of detroit junk   the imports   all inferior way over priced copies of gmc and chrysler products buy american buy   explorer rocks detroit jon s howell michigan just north of hell   mi  
1213,1,  if so   this is the vehicle for all your adventures   whether one mile to your destination or   miles   it is still the most comfortable ride i have ever had car buying can be such a hassle   but this buying experience was not   my honey and i chose a beautiful red explorer   we like products   but their prices are much higher than   the look of the explorer was also an attraction next to the price   this explorer has power everything   seats   windows   etc   the roomy explorer has seats that fold down and a cover for the back behind the seat   so people don t have to see what you are hauling around   it is so nice to carry our golf clubs in a nice   reachable vehicle   versus a deep   dark trunk or a dirty pick up truck   the radio ahh   it has a cd and a tape deck   how many vehicles have you seen like that it had approximately   miles on it when we decided to take a trip down to alabama to visit some family   i was so amazed at the comfort and coziness for such a long trip   the radio was blasting and we were singing away   happy as we could be   i never thought we could be so happy driving for a long period of time in a vehicle you would think this vehicle wouldn t corner well   but oh my   you would be so surprised   i don t even feel it going around a corner   it is completely smooth   better than a car   no matter where we have been   i always am comfortable and feel completely safe   many of our friends have complimented us on how comfortable it is to ride in the back seat   none of them get sick anymore   we can take people and stuff anywhere and not ruin the comfortable exploring we do if you are looking for a roomy   comfortable get around vehicle this is a good choice br br  
1214,1,  the explorer is the best equipped   most reliable   and the most comfortable in its class when my wife and i decided to buy and suv we looked at them all   the rodeo   pathfinder   blazer   and runner   although the pathfinder and runner were very nice they just couldn t touch the complete package offer by the explorer i have a   month old and a dog   the explorer makes traveling them the two of them a breeze   the carseat fits great in the back   and the dog loves being out of the weather   my wife loves how easy it is to get the stroller in and out of the explorer vs   the contour for value   comfort   resell value   and safety look no further than the explorer br br  
1215,1,  when i signed a   yr lease for a new explorer i had never had a suv   i can t believe i lived so long with out one   i have    miles on the explorer and the my plan is to purchase it at lease end   my only warranty repair work has been the firestone tire recall and the rear window wiper stopped working   the am fm receiver is great   i can get radio stations i never could in my other vehicles   however   the standard speaker system is pretty lame and the in dash single cd player will skip if you go over really rough roads the air condition and heater is great   this vehicle isn t equipped with the rear heater ac vents   but with our summer trips to florida and winter trips to michigan the rear passengers were always comfortable   the front optional captain chairs are very comfortable and roomy   however   the rear seating isn t all that great for adults   but children seem to be content with the rear seat comfort and they like the added feeling of being   up high   with the wider window visibility   and since the back windows are darkly tinted we don t have the sun bake effect unlike other passenger cars   my young son has never felt car sick in this vehicle   the cargo area with the fold down rear seats is great for hauling everything from christmas trees to home remodeling supplies   the gas mileage is only about   mpg at best   and the passing ability on   lane roads is poor   but i assume this is normal for v suv s   hey   this is not a sports car cup holders    awesome   the   in the front can hold the biggest drink out there   even a   liter water bottle   and the   in the back are a blessing with kids snow wish i could report but we ve had a couple of really mild winters here in the midwest and i haven t had a chance to try her out   but she s great for going over curbs   explorer are everywhere   here in the midwest it would probably be very easy to find repair shops and parts to work on this vehicle when it s off warranty  
1216,1,  on june     i took possession of my   explorer   that summer i was driving a friend s mother to the dentist on a regular basis along with the regular trafficing of children   mine and others   the standard joke was the   little men   dancing on my dash board   in particular we would check out who accompanied the   little man with the pillow on his lap   i am writing this in october of    this beautifully designed car this wonderful car to drive is still a nightmare for the techs at the dealership   lights on the dash board disappear after a visit and reappear flashing new codes i am quite upset with that they can not and have not sent someone out from detroit to fix this car once and for all   has not supported the local dealership   it does in fact drive perfectly   although i come to ignore the   check engine    check fuel gauge and   fuel cap lights   this is dangerous   in fact there is going to be a problem and it will be ignored   we are used to these lights and their warnings are going to be ignored at the wrong time of all the parts that have been replaced   for example   side air bags in the fronts seats and air bag in the steering wheel   wiring harnesses   etc   nothing has totally solved the problem   it has actually only changed the flashing codes and the number of lights that come on   we are told that this is the only car with this problem that the dealership has had to deal with   it seems that must have encountered this problem with this model vehicle before or in other models   nevertheless   this is a problem and should be a priority   i am very unhappy with   maybe i should be directed to another dealership   but frankly   i think foard should be sending an   expert   out once and for all i do not want a new car   it could have other problems   i do not like the    i like my car   i want my car fixed   i do not want to do a trade in in all the visits and all the replacements of parts   it all ends up with another visit in same symptoms i was told by a woman at the regional headquarters that i had a guardian angel on my dash board  
1217,1,  this is my first bronco   i ve always have had full size x pickups   i m really impressed with its handling and power   mine has the   l engine   i was only getting about   mpg around town and   on the highway   i increased this dramatically along with its power   by putting a k n fuel injection performance pack air filter   i also switched out the stock coil with a crane   i put a   inch cat back exhaust   wow   what a difference   i now get close to mpg around town   i even get    mpg average crawling around the rocks in   wheel drive   i took out the auto locking hubs and replaced with warn locking hubs   it climbs with the best of the factory x s   much roomier than my trucks and turns on a dime happy you bet  
1218,1,  i just purchased a explorer   four wheel drive two door suv   and i love it   this truck is outstanding   room   the explorer is very roomy   it has room for several adults   and lots of gear   the back seat folds down for extra storage space   i recently transported two large mountain bikes in this vehicle   and they fit with no problem   in fact there was quite a bit of room to spare power and speed   oh yeah   this thing is   quot zippy quot   it feels like it could fly   the engine certainly provides more than enough power for a vehicle of this size   and with the wd engaged it can go through just about anything   i can t wait for winter to get her   so i can run it through some serious ice   snow   and mud handling   this truck corners very nicely   really grips the road   however i do have one complaint   the steering seems a bit   quot loose quot   a takes too little pressure on the wheel to turn   and this causes it to seem unstable   it really takes some getting used to brakes   good   solid antilock brakes   no complaints there ammenities   air conditioner   power locks   power windows   am fm cassette stereo   all the standard bells and whistles   i just wish it had a cd player aesthetics   mine is red   very red   the lines are smooth   and rounded   it has a very pleasing look to it   the gray interior is a nice counterpoint to the bright red exterior   it provides a calming effect   overall this thing looks great safety   seat belts   natch   air bags   two   anti lock brakes   that s about all you can ask for in conclusion   a great vehicle   all around wonderful with two points of worry   steering takes some getting used to   and doesn t have a cd player br br  
1219,1,  boy   how i hated fords   at the time i was buying my thunderbird   i thought it would be the perfect vehicle   i was dead wrong   there was more wrong with this car than right and couldn t seem to find and fix all the problems that existed with this monster we decided to trade it in and buy something new   my   die hard loving   husband wanted a   i wanted something that didn t spend more time in the shop than on the road   since he owned a truck that required little maintenance   took him to and from work for the past   years and had well over    miles on it   i figured a truck might be the way to go   seemed to make better trucks than cars we began looking at various   trucks   and suvs   actually   at that time   our suv was considered to be a   truck   so much for a name   anyway   at a local dealer   we spotted a very handsome   suv   called the   explorer xlt with   wheel drive    living on long island   ny   with a married daughter in the hills of connecticut   we realized   wheel drive was necessary what first attracted me to the explorer was its looks   i wanted a mid sized   truck   that didn t have the spare tire hanging on the way of the back hatch   neither did i want something that looked like an over sized station wagon   seeing the explorer   i took it for a test drive   i was immediately impressed on its easy handling   although i had been driving a small miata   and sometimes the thunderbird when it wasn t in the shop   the larger vehicle was just as easy to maneuver through heavy traffic   there was no effort at all in fitting into tight parking spots and the mirrors located on each front side door   along with the rearview mirror   makes spotting any surrounding vehicles a piece of cake   my explorer has   electronic seats   which makes it easier to position for either my husband or myself   just one press of the button will easily bring you forward or back   put the button up and the seat rises up   for those people like me who like to sit higher in the seat   push that same button down   and the seat lowers   for those taller people who need the extra head room   the   lumbar pillow   is adjustable by pressing another button located directly above the seat positioning button   when the lumbar pillow is inflated   it definitely comes in handy to relieve the pressure off my back and make the ride so much more comfortable   since the   back seat fold down individually    it s most convenient when comes to visit and we load the back with supplies   this way   should you only have one back seat passenger but a whole lot of items to carry   you can lower only the one seat and your passenger can sit comfortably and enjoy the ride b and speaking of the back b   there is more room than we know what to do with    which   now that we live in florida   comes in handy for our trips to the north at christmas   and the addition of so many grandchildren who love toys   my explorer came with a     efi   fuel injected   catalyst   v engine    after all these years   the pick up this engine emits is awesome   whether doing the   unbearable    mph here in my small town of pgi or the   more enjoyable    mph on i    on our trips north   the engine has never failed to give its best   never once hesitating or failing in any way our model is equipped with a    speed o d automatic transmission    in addition to the   driver and passenger airbags    the other safety feature i like best is the    wheel anti lock brake system   and side door guard beams   for those who have children   or visiting grandchildren   you ll enjoy the   standard child proof rear door locks    in other words   the doors will not open from the inside   however   these locks can be turned off for the comfort of adults sitting in the rear another part of my explorer s standard equipment is the very functional    wheel drive control trac drive   electric shift transfer case and rack    pinion steering b in addition to it s   independent front suspension   all four wheels have powered disc brakes   while there are just so many other little things that make this vehicle a dream to own and drive   the most important is that i ve found it to be almost maintenance free   with the exception of periodic oil changes   and finally tire changes   we have had to do nothing else    not even a brake change    yet this suv   truck   has certainly changed my mind about fords   would i buy another   as long as i can have another explorer i think the explorer is a great car for active people who are looking for something large enough to store and haul equipment and yet   want the maneuverability of a small car   the explorer offers both   i ve had my explorer for over five years and have found nothing to dislike about it   in fact   we praised our explorer so much   that when our friends needed a new car   they went directly to a dealership and bought the sports model of the explorer   which is a bit smaller than ours   but suits them fine   but that s their story  
1220,1,  i highly recommend this explorer   i own a   xlt v   sohc   i purchased this vehicle b c of its value   great engine performance   still has great pickup after    yrs   and had all the options i wanted without getting a lot of other useless features driving this vehicle is very smooth   it has a relatively good turning radius   given its size   i have driven it in rain   great handling when going through mud puddles on the highways   snow   on the way to the mountains   ice   last christmas   and it is very controlled   amp   responsive   note this is an suv so it doesn t corner as tightly as a car sport car   but the pros outweigh this con   also this is the same problem for other suv s of this size when i was looking for an suv   it looked for   a minimum of a v   which shut out a lot of the smaller suv s   power for the money   i looked at a jeep grand cherokee but would have to get a v in order to get any pickup   it would ride high   as opposed to a subaru   full time wd   so i wouldn t have to be changing back   amp   forth   thus discounted toyota runner   wide back seats   i e   the amount of room to get into the back seat   this discounted a land rover discovery   you have to really twist in order to get into the back seat   lift glass in the rear door   would recommend the explorer read door configuration   the same on a   grand cherokee   i e   it lifts up   so you can stand under it   which is quite nice in rainy portland preferred the spare tire to not be in the cargo area i also required that the suv has a sun moonroof   amp   cd player changer as a side note the stereo on this explorer is very good   no clipping or distortion br br  
1221,1,  this product has proven completely reliable   comfortable and utilitarian   and i highly recommend an explorer for a family or adventurer   either the v   power or the v   is great   i ve had both   and the v   has full time all wheel drive   which is helpful for those of us who commute in snowy climates   it s a strong engine which warms up quickly and started yesterday after sitting in a parking lot for   hours in five degree temperatures the creature comforts   like heated leather seats   are wonderful and make for comfortable driving trips   the rear seats fold easily and cargo is protected by an easily removable cargo cover   driving position is comfortable for my    quot   frame and also for my smaller friends i haul all sorts of things   and pull a three place snowmobile trailer   with sleds   with no problem i highly recommend the explorer for the demanding consumer who wants a long term reliable vehicle br br  
1222,1,  when i bought my first explorer i owned a town car by lincoln   i never felt very comfortable in it because i always felt it was not me   when i traded it for my explorer i felt like i had been liberated   i have more fun driving this car than any i have ever owned   i now own my second explorer and will buy another when the time comes to trade   this is a perfect car for me because i travel a lot and i feel very safe in it and also i am a grandmother to four wonderful children   they have a great time riding with me   the only time i feel uncomfortable is on sunday going to church and i have so far to step up in a dress   this is a great car and i do recommend it br br  
1223,1,  i personally own one and i love it   still the best selling sport utility on the planet   the explorer rolls into    essentially unchanged from its   redesign   although a number of details have been improved   including refinements to the control trac automatic wd system and   for     standard four wheel antilock brakes   an even more significant enhancement   added for the    model year   is the option of a new overhead cam    liter v engine and a five speed automatic transmission   the new v came along a little too late for our testing last year   so that was our prime focus for     and when the dust had settled we emerged with a strong respect for this new engine   with   horsepower and   ft lbs   of torque   hp and   more ft lbs   than the standard v   a    liter pushrod design the new v delivers far better go and hauling power   a    pound towing capacity   versus    pounds   than the anemic base engine   also offers a    liter v option   but the wd system that goes with the v does not include a low range feature   the explorer s handling was no better than average in our track testing   marked by strong understeer and a slight tendency to lift the inside front wheel when pressed to its limits   on the other hand   its rack and pinion steering system is among the best   both in feel and precision   the same can be said for its braking   and the improved abs reduces the unnerving pedal pulse and noise that still afflicts some antilock systems   as with the durango   the four door explorer s long wheelbase     inches   and limited ground clearance conspire to make it a marginal choice for tough off road conditions   if that s likely to be on your menu   the two door version is a better bet   with packages designed to enhance clearances and a much shorter     inches   wheelbase   the explorer s strongest suit continues to be roominess   even though it s been upstaged a bit in this department by the durango   the explorer also has one of the most attractive interior designs of any sport utility   excellent seating   and   like most of its competition   a wide range of features and options   some of the trim packages the eddie bauer and limited versions   for example will send the price well over      but if you shop the option list judiciously   the explorer is still a good buy   with or without wd   our only major caveat   avoid the base engine   even though the base v is the only one offered with a manual transmission   the new overhead cam engine makes the going much more pleasant     
1224,1,  in   i met my husband   in   we had twins   in   we bought a minivan   ack   what were we thinking   but before i go on and on about the dehumanizing effects of driving around in that giant green   passenger egg   let me just say how relieved we all were when we finally got rid of it and   in    bought ourselves a   explorer xl i d been enamored with the explorer since i d worked   briefly   for in the mid   s   during that time i had driven a couple of explorers and really loved   em   unfortunately   price was a major issue    plus after we had the twins everyone convinced me we needed the dreaded minivan   for more on that see my separate review   the explorer is just a cool vehicle   especially up here in the pacific northwest where everybody and their neighbor owns an suv   yes   the road is practically littered with explorers    but maybe i m just not the stand out in the crowd type now for the specifics   i personally   love   that the explorer has less space than the minivan   from   seats to     i thought it would be a sacrifice but it hasn t been   there is plenty of room for our family and one extra passenger   we rarely used all   seats in the minivan   and speaking of space   that minivan seemed to just attract junk   well   the explorer does too   maybe it s not the car   but the kids who attract junk   but it attracts a lot less junk and is a breeze to clean out the seating itself is comfortable   roomy enough for our larger than normal derrieres and for both kids to spread out a little in the back seat   in the front seat   there is a nice console between the driver and passenger    including space for cd s   cassettes    drinks   and a little slot just perfectly sized for our cel phone   there is also a larger than average glove compartment and   makeup mirrors   on both the driver and passenger visors   in the back seat   there are seat pockets in front of each child    a big bonus   i d love to see   and for that matter   every other manufacturer who hasn t already done so   integrate cup holders into the back seats   it s a nice feature   and it s one thing i do miss about the minivan the rear cargo area of the explorer is roomy and functional   it holds a lot of stuff   we do lots of camping   and is at waist height so it s easy to load unload without too much bending and reaching   also easy to vaccum     of the back seat also folds down flat   so that you can fit in longer things   we hauled lumber last week and still fit both of us and the two kids in the car there are a couple of features on this vehicle that really stand out   first is the rear glass can be opened separately from the rear door   that way   if you just want to stick some groceries in you don t have to open up the whole door   another wonderful feature is that the whole car can be locked unlocked via a well placed switch inside the back door   so while i m loading the groceries   i can unlock the doors for the kids without having to fumble for my keys our explorer also includes a towing package   making it capable of towing up to    pounds   about the size of a small travel trailer or boat   a nice cassette stereo system   and roof rack   the vehicle is sturdy   survived a rear end collision this winter that caused     in damage to the other vehicle and left our car with not even a scratch   roomy   and safe   we also have had the opportunity to use the wd a couple of times and it worked flawlessly   it s shift on the fly so there is no need to get out of the car to lock the hubs or anything annoying like that   our repair bills   knock on wood   have been negligible    we keep the oil changed and keep up on the schedule maintenance   and   i know i m jinxing myself here   she runs like a gem the only major drawbacks to the explorer are the excessive road noise   sometimes that s nice   though   as it tends to lull the kids to sleep   and the poor gas mileage   we fill up about once a week   and that s with average daily around town driving   a freeway trip to seattle    miles round trip   costs us about     in gas   expect about   miles per tank full on the highway and about   in town   i guess that s just what we expect when you buy an suv   though    we have to trade   something   for all that space  
1225,1,  i love my explorer   as i sat in many a traffic jam in my tiny little aging economy car   i longed at the explorers that sat in my view   considering my situation   newly married and planning a family   in a professional job   having hobbies including skeet shooting   woodworking   and other things that would require some cargo space   i felt that the explorer would be an excellent car for me the best things about the care in my opinion are being up high   looking sharp   and having an excellent balance between cargo space and passenger space   i am no longer ashamed to drive my bosses around   but i can still haul a big pile of wood and tools from home depot when i get the urge to try that   weekend   woodworking project   or help my friends fix up their homes   the safety features of the explorer are also a plus   my wife used to cringe at the thought of me driving around in my little sentra that had no airbags   let alone crumple zones or reinforced doors   it is very comforting to have a safe car i can t say that i m totally without complaints   but i have learned to live with the few i have about the explorer   okay   so it is a bit bouncy   it s a truck   it s supposed to be bouncy   if i wanted a smooth ride   i would ve bought something lower to the ground   and note that i say   bouncy   not bumpy   though you do bounce up and down over a speedbump or a bump in the road   you are not being racked around like a rock in a tumbler   its more smooth   like a waterbed   another thing is that it gets really poor gas mileage   again   good gas mileage is for honda accords and toyota corollas   the trade off is worth it to me   if i have to fill up a little more often   it s worth the power and space i have   and the tank is gal   so it does last a while   even with the poor mileage other than the bouncy problem   driving the explorer is like a dream   it handles very well   stops nice   and has enough power to get you around that   wheeler that is weaving from side to side   and it is very   very quiet if you have the means and are ready to move into the suv class   i would recommend an explorer   if you want good gas mileage and a smoother ride   you might want to look at one of the smaller suvs from those manufacturers that make the high gas mileage economy cars   and if you want a smoother ride   you ll probably have to dish out a few thousand extra bucks and go for one of those luxury manufacturer suvs   but if you just want a good solid   american   made car   though i d venture to guess that few cars are completely made in america today   that gives you the best features of a passenger car with the versatility of a pickup   i d go for the explorer br br  
1226,1,  i bought this   explorer because i wanted to upgrade to something larger than a car   but not a mini van   i can tow   should i need to   but don t on a regular basis   it s big   but not too big   i love the adjustable seats   being only    quot   i can set my seat just the way i want to   and i can see over the hood   i have the tinted windows   which i think keep my explorer cooler in the hot   sunny south   it also provides some privacy   i find it gives me a very comfortable ride   even on long   hour trips   my husband drives a lexus and says the explorer drives like a truck   but that i know   i still think it is a comfortable ride   for a truck it has pretty good pickup for a v   i didn t get the   wheel drive   but plan to the next time around   at the time   i didn t think i would really need it   but it would have been nice to have   the dash is laid out really nice and i love the middle console   it holds my cd s and a tissue box holder is build in   and if i need to slide in something larger than the back cargo area   i can fold down the back seats br br  
1227,1,  when i was shopping for a newer vehicle i wanted something that would get me back and forth to work   and something that was fun to drive on weekends   i think i got both   so far   i have taken my   explorer sport four wheeling in places most people wouldn t take their beat up off roaders   i have taken it on trails in the woods   through swamps   and through a few snow drifts   and   when i was done playing   i took it to the car wash   hosed it off   put a new coat of wax on it   and it was ready to go to work on mondays like any vehicle   there were some minor problems   one was a bad sensor for the   wheel drive selenoid   the truck would shift into   low and not come out until i would shut it off and start it again   that was fixed under warranty   and hasn t occoured since   other than that   the usual maintenance items are all that needed replacing on this truck i would recommend it to anyone looking for a functional   and fun vehicle   it rides and handles great on and off road     
1228,1,  i own a   escort   i love it   even though a   door it is still small enough to fit into the smallest parking space   which means alot to me   if your looking for a car that handles great in the winter   this is your car   this car is the most reliable car i ve owned yet   i bought it used and though   years old i havent had a single problem with it yet   also though small it is still quite roomy   i think this car is an all occasions car   good for family   teenagers just starting out   or anyone   also has an awesome heating system br br  
1229,1,  its just a great   reliable little car   we commute   miles a week and have     miles on this four year old car and she s still running strong   in all those miles   we ve only spent about    in maintenance on her   we tried to run her out of oil on a trip to canada   keep forgetting to get the oil changed   don t get her washed enough   but she still keeps going   very comfortable   even for   larger people in front   run medium grade gasoline in her and she s very peppy on the highway too   even with all those miles   our escort still averages   mpg with an even mix of highway travel and in town traffic   we d definitely buy an escort again and plan to stick with fords in general in the future br br

1231,1,  if you needed a commuter vehicle   what would you want most   when i bought my   festiva new   i went out with a list that looked like this   i want it to be small so i can park anywhere   i want it to run on fumes   cheap to insure   not a lot of bells and whistles to break and encourage theft   and to be ugly enough to discourage the thieves and junkie denizens of my commute destination   it d be a cold day in hell if i ever found this car up on blocks missing those tiny   quot   wheels   i put sears or grand auto     for four tires on it every couple of years   it has no radio   five of my radios in other cars were stolen in sf with lots of damage to the car   i also wanted a well built   reliable car   so when i learned that the festiva was built in korea using mazda parts   i knew i had found what i wanted the car is now over   years old   has over k miles   looks like a habitue of the bowery   but still will travel at sustained speeds of   mph   if needed   it continues to get    miles to the gallon   my ownership expenses are minimal   one battery   self done oil changes every   k miles   the front disc brake pads replaced once   and it s on its third set of   quot   tires   insurance for it runs about    yr   and no one has ever tried to steal it   this    horribly ugly surf green festiva is   quite simply   the least troublesome   inexpensive car i ve ever owned   too bad stopped selling them after the    model year i have tried finding body parts for this car in junkyards it got sideswiped while parked   and has lots of ugly bondo   but most in my area don t even have a single festiva   so people must be keeping them   if you can get one that has been taken care of   don t have too much concern for how pretty and impressive your commute car is   you ll have some trouble finding anything better suited for commuting that will serve you as well as this ugly duckling   no   mine is not for sale   i m going to run it till one of us dies     
1232,1,  we bought our   festiva new   and the   quot korean komet quot   or   quot red rocket quot   is still serving us today   the car gets incredible mileage and almost never needs repairs   and it starts up in even the coldest of weather   it handles well in the snow   and has an amazing turning radius   you could park this thing anywhere   i guess the only downside is that if you should get hit in this thing   there s not much car to protect you   other than that   i think the car has a lot of personality and is a great value   i m a high school student and i just put a new sound system in   and now i can cruise for chicks in my sweet ride while blasting out the beach boys tunes   woooo br br  
1233,1,  we are stationed overseas in okinawa japan through the airforce   we are used to driving old foreign junkers that we picked up for about    or less   just to last us through our tour and also allowed us to save some money   we decided that since we are leaving okinawa for hawaii or guam   it was time to buy a new car for all of our hard work and sacrifice in paying off bills   enter the debate escape    or   pontiac aztec   now some of you will immediately shout out   ugghhh   not the aztec   but i fell in love with the aztec immediately   the amazing features and handling of that srv are just so wonderful   and yes   i am one of the rare breeds that actually love the styling of the aztec   my husband on the other hand fell in love with the escape   which i had to admit   was my first choice before spotting the aztec   to make a long story short   we chose the aztec   don t get me wrong   i think the escape is great vehicle   which is why i decided to write this review after our test drive   if the aztec is too out there for you   or if you just think it is ugly    then i would definitly check out the escape the shell   this is a steel shell that protects the entire front end   and continues around the sides using   side intrusion door beams    steel beams along each and every door for protection in a crash   i have to young girls who sit in carseats on the outer back seats   and this feature makes me feel all warm and cozy inside   knowing that they are protected   throw in the dual and side airbags   and i am on cloud nine   when i found out that the aztec had this feature also   i was sold   otherwise it would have been the escape when i drove the suv   it was sooooooo smooth   no rattles whatsoever   it was peaceful   my kids were not inside at the time   lol   i felt that it accelerated super fast and powerful   but then again   i am not used to driving state of the art speed cars   quite the opposite actually   if you are going from a   or some other sporty get up   then you may be disappointed   i sure wasn t   it cornered wonderfully   those u turns we all need to make from time to time would be soo easy   as the wheel turning radius   have no idea if i am using the right terminology   seems very tight   nice sharp turns   parking was a breeze   as again   the wheel turning radius is nice and sharp   i felt no roll at all when making quick and fast turns   it did score a   star rating on the roll over resistance rating for both the   wheel drive and   wheel drive   this is the highest rating that suv s have gotten   except for the pontiac aztec x    door which scored a   out of   stars   the   wheel drive aztec scored a    while there have not been any crash tests on the escape x   the x has received excellent ratings    stars for the tests done on the front driver side   side drivers side and rear seats side   and   starts for the front passenger side test   this is awesome on a low note   i did feel that for the xlt model   the controls and front panels were a bit basic looking   nothing high tech   but a small tradeoff for the superior safety you get from this suv   another thing that bothers me is the gas mileage which is supposedly around     but i knew this going in to an suv   i guess if gas mileage is a big concern for you   then forget the suv and opt for a sedan or passenger car   another more minor detail that bothers me   with the xlt   you get the   disc in dash cd changer system   but only   speakers   it seams for such a large   larger than a car   vehicle with an upgraded sound system   they could at least throw in a few more speakers   you can get the   speaker system added on   but for about    more   sheesh   on the aztec    speaker is standard i believe   with also some speakers in very back for tailgating usage   some other feature that the aztec has that i think would be nice on the escape are as follows    hud   heads up display   projects speed and other info onto the lower windshield so you can always see it without taking eyes off the road   come on   add that on the escape   acceleration volume control   made that term up to   lol   as your speed increases   the volume on your stereo slightly elevates   and visa versa as speed decreases   power outlets in rear of vehicle   aztec has outlets in the rear   for use during camping   cleaning   etc   just a nice touch   stereo controls on the steering wheel   i want that   man oh   and also   the price i was quoted is from the aafes military car sales   if you are military   i highly suggest that you check out your aafes dealership before considering another dealership   great experience   the only options that i did not get with my price were   leather seats    the side stepping bar   i did get the choice xlt model   higher than the value   and lower than sport   but did not want sport anyhow    thanks for reading my review   i am not a car professional   but wanted to comment on these   vehicles in a safety comparison   good luck in your suv purchase   i am also writing a review for the aztec   so check it out if you are interested good luck  
1234,1,  i traded in my lexus    so i m new to suv s and american made vehicles   but i was looking for something that would give me more flexibility and was fun to drive the   escape fit the bill   i first test drove the sister suv the mazda tribute and was instantly hooked   when i started doing research i discovered that sold the identical   minor trim changes   vehicle but usually at a lower price    and was offering much better financing terms and more for my trade in a week after taking delivery on my   xlt v with leather interior and the premium sound system   i went on a   day road trip and must say that overall i found the truck very comfortable   very economical   and fun to drive   there is considerably more road noise than with my lexus    but i figured it was just because you are sitting up so much higher and you have all that trim and luggage rack that adds to the wind noise   i have read several reviews that talk about engine noise    i have heard none    just wind noise at high speeds   i do have a complaint about the placement of the steering column shifter    it does block easy access to the volume button on the radio    but once you get use to it    not a problem   there is lot s of cargo space which i have really enjoyed    a nice retractable cargo cover   and an adjustable luggage rack   i guess i m spoilt by the lexus    but i find the carpets in my escape to be a little skimpy    i just keep reminding myself that it s a truck   the leather seats are comfortable by not luxurious   the stereo on the other hand is actually better than the lexus    great system   i like to drive with my headlights on and the   comes with auto lights out after about   minutes but the irritating thing is the dinger still sounds when you leave the lights on   i don t see the point of having an auto lights out feature if the alarm is going to sound  
1235,1,  i am not going to write about stats and specs for this suv   that is mostly available in car magazines   and many other websites first impressions    from the outside   it looks larger and   meaner   than a comparably priced toyota rav or honda crv   it looks tough and durable and not quite as   cute   as other comparable mini suvs    the two tone body color takes a little getting used to   i liked the silver color   so it blends a bit better with the black    i really like the factory alloy wheels   it looks sporty   rugged   and classy at the same time    the front looks ready for off road   similar to an explorer the interior    very nice   the leather is comfortable and i was impressed with number of features it offers for the price   it has power front seats   large moonroof   very roomy for a small suv   and the gauges are nicely located and very easy to read     the mach audio system is probably one of the best factory sound system i have listened to   it comes with   disc changer   and   speakers     the controls seem to plain such as the ac controls   vents   etc   also   one complaint i have was it has no air vents for the rear seats   the drive    it was a bit on the loud and rough side    acceleration is car like but i was hoping it would be faster since it is after all   a   hp v carrying a fairly light load   i have driven the runner   which has less power and heavier   but seems to accelerate just as fast   i suppose the powerband of the s duratec v is geared towards more on the upper rpms     with its independent suspension   the escape handles like a car and show no hint of tilt or body roll on a fairly fast   degree turn    the power brakes are good but does not have the car like stopping power this suv provides an overall good balance in terms of    price    features    performance and one last thing   this suv does not cost too much to insure  
1236,1,  i recently had the chance to rent a loaded escape for a week long business trip an experience i have been looking forward to having   overall   i liked the escape a great deal   but i m not sure i d plunk down my own hard earned dollars to own one the escape does everything well   it is amazingly roomy and well laid out for such a small vehicle   seat comfort was great   there was tons of cargo room   ride and handling were very enjoyable   and the v performed well   offers lots of well thought out gadgets and toys in the escape things like armrests and storage compartments and radio controls feel especially well placed and engineered   the escape was easy to drive for long periods and was an enjoyable   airy place to spend time   on the highway and back roads   the escape handles better than almost every other suv i ve ever driven   large and small   i even had the chance to take the escape off road a little bit   and it was less happy there   the escape felt much more like a tall station wagon than a true suv while off the pavement   i recall my mother s explorer feeling much the same when taken off the beaten path   of course   most folks will never use the escape s suv ness in anything other than snow and rain   and i m sure that the all wheel drive is perfect in these situations   however   the awd was slow to engage off road and the minimal ground clearance   for an suv   didn t help matters my complaints about the escape are   ironically   centered around its strengths   though the is very good at lots of things   it seems to have sacrificed being truly great in any areas to be so competent overall   the v is powerful   but it sucks up gas and is very noisy   so much so that the radio has to be blared to drown out the sound   as long as you have plenty of cds which you enjoy on hand you will never mind   but there is no escaping the fact that this is a noisy   and thirsty   vehicle   the ride and handling are great in    of situations   but one can not sling this thing around a highway off ramp at high speeds   finally   to make such a fine vehicle it feels that has cut costs in building materials and construction   the escape i drove had lots of rattles and felt and sounded generally loose   but this may be due to the fact that it was a rental and rentals are usually beaters   still   a brand new car shouldn t have felt so loose i have been thinking about getting a small suv   and the escape would be high on my list   so would a number of other terrific choices   though   i feel that a jeep liberty is just as pleasant a place to spend time   and the jeep has lots more character   both inside and out   the jeep also handles poorly   though   and is just as thirsty and loud as is the escape   then again   the jeep would go literally anywhere   on road or off   i feel that the new land rover freelander is similar more uniqueness but less utility   i think if it were my    on the line   i d go for the redesigned honda cr v   sure   it s be a little slower than the escape and certainly more dull to both look at and drive   but the honda s quality and fit and finish would be impeccable   it would be more efficient   and have even more room   of course   none of this changes the fact that the escape is a great all around car and i would certainly recommend it to friends who have lots of    for fuel and who are already hard of hearing  
1237,1,  we live on a small farm and needed a truck to haul feed and livestock   since our children are now teens we knew that the extended cab was ready to be upgraded to a full crew cab   the full crew cab gives plenty of room for up to six people   this pickup handles all of our family s needs   it is a workhorse for the farm and a pleasure to drive   and ride in   as a   quot family car quot   the   wheel drive is great when it comes time to get hay out of the field   or when off road   the power stroke diesel gives all the power you could want when passing on the highway   even when hauling or pulling a load   the new   quot scalloped quot   front driver and passenger windows are really a great help for seeing small cars beside you   this is a great vehicle for people that need to haul and have a family   because of the relatively low gas mileage i would not recommend it for total pleasure use or for singles or couples   although the diesel engine gets better mileage than a gas engine br br  
1238,1,  my f is a fine truck however having problems with fixing two major problems   problems are as follows    my truck is a early model   the air intake is in the fender well and i have a problem a loud sucking or as i call it a loud howling noise from that area   s district mgr refuses to fix the problem   dealers in other areas have solved this problem by rerouting the air intake to the front grille like the later models and this does fix the problem     when i start the powerstroke after setting for awhile i get a loud thump noise from under the hood   i continually complain about this but nothing seems to be done to fix it   
1239,1,  the   f   has an awesome look to match it s awesome abilities   the model we purchased has four doors   the long ft bed   wd and is toped off with the triton v   engine with enough horsepower to satisfy any truck fan   big and roomy   made this truck to complete many tasks that will fit everyone   from hauling ft sheets of plywood   moving a friend   taking huge loads of branches to the local dump   taking a long family trip   or even for a mountain hunting trip   this truck is truly built tough   personal recommendations   put on a camper shell if you want to use it for travel   you can fit   people very comfortable   so having the shell will enable you to put all of your travel needs   as well as shopping bags in an air shell for both room and protection   with a shell on the long bed   this truck will be bigger and badder that the suburbans   and even fords new excursion   also   putting a supercharger will bulk up the already tremendous amount of horsepower so i wouldn t call it a necessity   put on a   or   chamber flowmaster muffler to get out that loud v   sound   and if you like custom vehicles   change the tires and rims to either get a lower   sleeker look   or a higher   tougher look   take it for a test drive and feel the power of triton engines br br  
1240,1,  the f   with the    turbo diesel is the best truck on the road   with its lbs of torque it will pull just about anything   horse trailers   trailers are no problem for this truck   it pulls a hill with a trailer behind it as if it was not there at all   comfort is a given in this truck   wether you get the     seats or the captains chairs you will ride in comfort   the adjustable seat belts make it easy for a tall or short person to be comfortable and not have a strap rub them over their neck   the mileage factor with the    is fantastic   when you are not pulling a load   mpg is normal and under load   is average   you will leave a cummings in the dust if you are both pulling a hill   the power is fantastic as the saying goes   quot try it you ll like it quot br br  
1241,1,  at the age of   i bought my first   f   it was a great truck it had    miles on it and still ran like a top   i added a k n filter and it upped my horse power and shortly after that i added dual exhaust and man did that baby roar   i had very little engine trouble   in that fall of   i sold this truck but not because of the truck i just wanted bigger and better so i bought my second   f    i can haul anything that i need and have all the horsepower any country hick like me would need   i have never been stuck even though i have tried   i have many late night calls to pull vehicles out of ditches or mud and have not had a problem yet   this truck also has over    miles and i have yet to have any engine or transmission problems probably due to the fact that the engine is very strong and has great get up and go power and the tranmission has very smooth shifting   i would put my   f   against any full size truck out there now i am now   years and have been a f   lover for   years now and will never go back   not only have i not had any mechanical problems but no structural problems either i am more impressed with this truck than any other   the handling on this vehicle is decent the turning radius isn t the best but all around it is alright   i haven t ever had a load on the vehicle that has ever effected the handling   the brakes on the f   are excellent with very good stopping power   the only thing i could say is that they are relatively touchy if you are out there and you are looking for raw towing power along with horse power and a comfortable smooth ride on and off the highway with a drivers seat that you could sleep in that will get you around anywhere then the f    wheel drive is the way to go one drawback to this vehicle is the gas mileage on the regular stock truck i would get about    mpg on the highway and about    in town but now that i have the    tires and the    body lift i get about    in town and    on the highway so far with my f   i have added many accessories to my truck like    inch body lift    inch mud brute tires   th wheel hitch in the middle my truck bed   k n high performance air filter   delta toolbox   reese hitch so if you are out there and looking for a truck with all around use this is the one for you it hasn t let me down and i don t believe it would let you down either  
1242,1,  i bought my wagon used in    it s a    low mileage and price is what first brought me to this car   upon test driving it though   i really found that i liked it even better   it was a nice ride   i m not one for mini van s or suv s   so this was a good option for me   i ve never had trouble fitting anything and everything in this wagon   put it this way    adults    child with car seat   luggage for   days   and   lb dog all fit in this wagon   and the only problem that i have had is the fan that cool s the engine that should come on and off depending on temp   doesn t   and still can not find anyone who can fix it   though i have figured a way around it   i know that when this wagon need s to be replaced   no question in my mind   it will be another escort wagon br br  
1243,1,  i used to own a   escort in college   and it was a great car   it was a   speed with the dual overhead cam which made for a very sporty ride   people were always surprised by the performance   and i was always very pleased with it   the interior was extremely comfy   with lots of room in the back seat    door   pleanty of head and leg room   and the trunk had generous space as well   i bought it used and never had to fix anything on it   well once i had to replace the battery   it was a wonderful car   and always reliable and dependable   if you re thinking about buying a used one in this era   i would strongly recommed that you get one with the cam   you won t regret it   i loved the car br br  
1244,1,  having recently purchased a   taurus   age is finally starting to get to me   at least i am not too old   as i did not even consider a buick lesabre   ain t middle age great of all the mid to large size cars available in this class   one has the choice of the chevy impala   the pontiac bonneville   and the intrepid from the domestic manufacturers   and the nissan maxmia   the honda accord   the toyota camary   the mazda    and the subaru legecy from japan   and the hyundai sonota from korea   plus the volkswagen passat from germany the impala would not have been a bad choice as it is slightly better equipped for about the same price   however the engine is of a cast iron pushrod design that has been around since louis built his first car in    the interior looks postively cheap   like it was lifted right out of a chevette   the pontiac has sooo many tacked on plastic body clading it looks like a third grade car design competition gone amok   the issues i had with the is that the    liter engine has a dubious history as i have seen many fail prematurely due to the water pump failing and the pump itself is built into the block all of the cars from japan   except the maxmia and subauru   come standard with   cylinder engines   i prefer a   cylinder   but where they are an option   this prices them a couple of thousand more than a taurus   i had driven a hyundai sonata   and was somewhat impressed   however it was smaller inside   and i later found out that hyundai had lied about the horsepower figures for the    liter engine and had to offer consumers cash or an extension of the warranty the volkswagen was just too expensive for the amount of room and features which brings us back to the taurus   i know that the resale value will not be as good as the japanese as these vehicles are the choice of rental car companies and commercial fleets   there are simply a ton of tauruses on the roads and the law of supply and demand dictates that when it comes time to sell or trade   don t expect much   the plus to this situation is that normal wear and tear parts will be easy to come by and downright cheap to obtain i purchased a taurus ses with the sport package   with this i received the    dohc duratec v   two tone cloth bucket seats   special alloy wheels and a rear spoiler   plus threw in a free sunroof   the wife was parcial to getting the leather interior and the wood package   however with the dog to be riding in the back seat   perhaps cloth was the better choice   stepping up to the ses trim duratec combo helps avoid having the car appear to be a rental vehicle driving the taurus reveals that the duratec is smooth and powerful   and with a chain driven camshaft design   i will not be worring about replacing the drive belt   it is reasonably quiet and the   speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly   however it does not allow manual selection for the full range of ratios   wind noise is not at all objectionable   and the seats are comfortable   the epa rates this as a large car and interior room is very good   with the exception of the front wheel well intruding on your left foot space   the brakes   std abs in the ses   are very good   steering with the variable assist is linear and handling is also very good what you don t get for your money is somewhat minor   rear disc brakes are only available in the wagon model   however with the front brakes handling    of the braking force   this is a non issue   a power adjustable passenger seat is only available in the top of the line sel model   so your front seat passenger will just have to deal with that the best that they can   side air bags are also a option   some of the places where also saved money is in the use of cheap feeling switches   however they all do work and perform their intended uses   the only major gripe that i have is that the cheap plastic console squeaks and that is houses the equally cheap   disc cd changer magazine that was made in china   i could have done without the rear spoiler   as i seriously doubt that it adds much downforce or makes the car handle any better with pushing the metal out the door with incentives   this allows one to purchase a fully equipped taurus for the price of a fully equipped honda civic   nissan altima   or toyota corolla   to me   it was a no brainer   with    in rebates and the ability to purchase at dealer invoice   the initial value is just too hard to pass up  
1245,1,  when i first started looking for another car   i knew i wanted an suv of some type   i do a lot of traveling on the road and i like to have room for all of my luggage   camping gear and emergency equipment as well as my passengers   this baby does it all with room to spare and good gas mileage too i had looked at the montero   the runner and the blazer first   the montero is nice and roomy   but the mileage sucks   it s expensive and the insurance on them is outrageous for someone my age    at the time   then i looked at the runner   nice   decent mileage and it has a fair sized cab   but again the insurance was killer plus they seemed to be breaking down a lot and were not cheap to fix   now the blazer was really nice   good mileage   fairly cheap insurance   but it was really   really small inside   the back seats were barely there then i came to the dealership   they showed me a few explorers and i was hooked   they have a good v   engine   good sized front and back seats   plus a decent storage area in the rear for all my gear   it also has an adjustable luggage rack on top and it got   miles to the gallon highway and   city   mine is the   sport edition so it only has   door   but that s all i need anyway   it is a   speed manual transmission   a must for me   and it has push button   wheel drive with low range   it also has a main dome light and   reading lights for the driver and front passenger   i signed the papers for it the same day and i have not had anything to complain about since then   and that was almost   years ago   i have had it in the shop for basic maintenance and had to have the radiator and water pump replaced   my fault though   but other than that it has run great for me   it always starts for me no matter what the weather is   i have started it in    and in    below without any problems   also   when they say   wheel drive they mean all   wheels   not one front wheel and one back wheel like some other companies do really the only thing i can complain about is that there is only one cup holder and it is inconveniently located behind and below the shifter knob   no problem for soda cans but a burger king cup gets knocked out every time i shift to third gear   other than that minor bit   it s a great suv and i couldn t be happier   i just topped    miles and i m sure i ll see    easy br br  
1246,1,  i have had my    explorer xlt   for a little over a year   i bought it with    miles on it   during this time i have driven it for over    miles   i have had it in the shop only for scheduled oil changes and tire rotations i drive every day for work in all weather conditions   i also drive my explorer off road from time to time   the explorer runs well and has excellent handling on snow and ice as well as in the mud   i was particularly happy with my explorer on december     when i was driving to columbus from cleveland as the first winter storm of the year blew through blanketing the streets with snow and causing white out conditions   i was driving south on us toward columbus and i counted   cars along the side of the road   one accident was a   car pile up   after seeing these accidents   i was cautious but i felt comfortable in my explorer   needless to say i arrived home safely and i credit much of my safety to my explorer i have compared it to a chevy blazer of a similar year and the blazer does not compare   not only does the explorer have more storage room   it is also much more comfortable to drive my explorer is very reliable and i feel safe driving it   i highly recommend the purchase of a explorer br br  
1247,1,  i have owned a    explorer sport for nine years   my driving skills are very aggressive   especially off road   this has placed me in several awkward and embarrassing moments due to my driving   the explorer came through everytime   and i don t even have all wheel drive capability   parts can be expensive and hard to find   but there worth it   i have never once broke down or have experienced a component failure   i do recommend upgrading stock tires to more aggressive tread and a k amp n filtercharger for increased performance   explorers do need constant care and attention   if this is done   you too may own a vehicle and still love it after   years     
1248,1,  i am extremely happy with this vehicle   i am a   over protective   mom of a teenage girl about to turn   years old   we gave her this vehicle a   explorer xlt for her birthday and to ease up on our schlepping back   amp   forth during very hectic work weeks   well   i was quite the wreck when she turned   last year and was got her drivers license   what parent isn t    we bought the explorer from a private party who practically gave it to us   they didn t want the hassle of having every tom   dick   and harry coming over to see it   after some initial repairs were made we brought it in to the owner s mechanic and had the front brakes done   along with the power steering unit everything else was in order we got the vehicle for      yes   you read that right   although it does have k miles on it   they were initially asking     then down to     then after repairs we had the gall to negotiate to    we then settled on     my daughter is the proud owner now and is quite smitten with her   brand new   suv   i want it     i feel very comfortable with her driving it   it s a safe vehicle i like the size and sturdiness of it   she handles it beautifully   it even has a tilt sunroof for a     it s almost in excellent condition except for some minor rust on the underside and a missing handle on the inside   i highly recommend this vehicle br br  
1249,1,  the   contour is really a great car for anybody   it runs great every time i start it up   i ve had it for   years now and absolutely no major problems   just a few minor fixer uppers   the reliability is amazing   the quality of the interior is nice   nothing fancy   but definitely nice and comfortable   the air conditioner vents are nicely designed and well placed   the over all look of the inside is well done   the v engine is nice and powerful   perfect for anyone the   contour is also very spacious   especially in the front   the back seats aren t too cramped though   and they could fit any average sized person comfortably   i am really impressed with the space this car has i can t say enough about the over all quality and reliability of this car   very nice for long or short trips   highly recommended  
1250,1,  i bought my   contour brand new   off the showroom floor   in july     from day one   it has been a joy to drive comfortable   easy to handle and fuel efficient   and the air conditioner works very well a critical issue in the texas heat while i don t drive every day   many of my trips keep me in the car for one to five hours at a time   the contour makes those trips easy it is always a challenge to find a car both my     husband and     me can drive   i don t have any trouble reaching the pedals in the contour   and my husband doesn t hit his head on the roof the car now has    miles on it   it has required minimal maintenance   you know   the usual   tires   brakes   oil changes   etc   and has been incredibly dependable   the only problem i can remember was with the sunroof switch   not factory installed   when the car sat in the sun and got hot   the switch wouldn t work   that took two trips to the dealership to get fixed looking at the car   it was not my first choice   i thought   and still do   that it is a sort of boring little lump   my husband begs to differ he loves the styling   my mind started to change the second i sat in the car   and i was sold as soon as i drove it   it also helped that i found one in teal   a color i love my original plan was to keep this car about six years   however   as we get closer to the six year mark   i find myself thinking i don t want to give it up that soon    update      i recently sold this car   after owning it   years and a couple of months   it had about    miles on it   and was still virtually trouble free   at one maintenance visit   the dealer service department mentioned that the ac clutch was a little loud   but didn t recommend doing anything because   in their words   the ac was   pumping out ice cubes   i hadn t heard the noise   and the ac continued to work well   in the last few months i owned the car   i noticed a bit of a squeal in the ac   but it continued to cool very well   even in the hot houston summers    and you wouldn t hear the squeal if you turned up the radio a little    o    i loved owning and driving this car   the only reason i decided to get a new car was that i take quite a few long road trips and i was concerned   at nearly    miles   that it might become less reliable   i didn t want to have the car s first breakdown on some deserted stretch of texas highway   my original review of the   contour stands   it was reliable   economical and comfortable   and i hope it s new owner enjoys it for many years to come  
1251,1,  i bought my contour with almost k   and it still runs great   it is very reliable   and has nice creature comforts   cd   sunroof   power everything   it is not very flashy   or overly sporty   it doesn t have much get up and go   but i do feel very safe with dual airbags   and traction control   it gets decent gas mileage   and seats four adults comfortably   i would recommend this car to someone looking for endurance at a good value   this car is also very easy to work on   and parts can be found at most major parts stores   i would recommend attempting personal maintenance over dealer maintenance which i was disappointed in the one time i took it to them br br  
1252,1,  i got a   gt from my parents back in   for my senior year   they always told me they would buy me and my sister one good car to go to college on and that was it   after that i would have to buy the next one   little did i know that i would still be driving this car almost   years later   well   that s exactly what i am doing and i haven t had it in the shop for more than minor work ever   i have never had to take it to the shop to do any kind of work on the engine   transmission   or other major parts   there are many pros to this particular car   there are also a few cons   i will list each of these below   keep in mind that this is a   year old car that has run like a charm ever since i got it b pros      acceleration and speed     i have never had a problem with the acceleration of this car   in fact   it will almost go too fast   i have had it at an ungodly speed   that i do not wish to diverge here   it will get up and go with the best of them      handling     i went to school at the university of arkansas my first year of college   the road i chose to take was very windy and i loved it   never once did i lose control of this car or even have the tires slip   i typically doubled each suggested speed limit up to around   mph     looks     even though this car is   years old   i have tried to keep it looking good   especially on the outside   i still get some looks from people while i am driving because the car demands looks from others   it is still fun to drive around town and see how many people turn their heads   this particular model was the first year put five star rims on it   in my epinion   this makes the car much more appealing to the eyes b cons      cheap minor parts     i think that spent all of their money on the engine and transmission   the major problem i have had with my car is minor parts breaking   i have replaced the inside and outside door handles more than once   the speedometer is broken   the hydraulics for the hatch won t hold up the hatch anymore   these are the majority of problems i have had   the door handles were just poorly made   they have some plastic parts that aren t very strong     service at dealership     i know this isn t really dealing with the car   but our local dealership is very hard to deal with   it is smith in conway   many times they refused to fix something that they actually screwed up   i had them put on a new door handle many years ago and they scratched the paint   they agreed to repaint the door   but it had new paint on it   the rest of the car had paint that was around four years old   it didn t match and you can still tell it today     spare tire     i know this is very minor   but i really wish they would have included a regular sized spare tire with the car   the donut tire is really small and   if you were in a bind   you can t drive it very fast so   there are a few pros and cons to the     i feel that the pros heavily outweigh the cons   yes   i would like to have a new car   but i m not getting rid of my pony   i plan on keeping it forever   i am going to rebuild it   fix the minor things that are wrong with it   and get a new paint job   then my wife and i can cruise around town in a    year old car that looks brand new   actually   i hope one of my kids wants to drive it when they get old enough br br  
1253,1,  i ve had my   lx for   years now   i had just come off a bad relationship with an   cadillac and found this rather sorry looking for sale by a private owner   i picked it up with hopes of exchanging it within a year for something better   but it seems to be getting better with age   i did an awful lot of cosmetic work on the car because it s previous owner did not care for it properly   now it is not only looking almost like new with it s original paint   but well accessorized as well   i ve added many performance products to this   l car and have gotten the response of a v   while maintaining the exceptional gas mileage   she spins tires in third gear   which   for the engine type   is impressive   it gets me to work and back   it s quick off the line   it looks great   and i ve had many offers   it s over the    mile mark and no leaks   it has visited the shop about   times for regular maintenance   radiator   clutch cable   differential gasket   other than that   i ve done all the tune ups and oil changes   runs like a dream   smooth   quick   and just plain exiting   unfortunately   you see too many of these cars on the road looking like they haven t seen a rag or sponge in years the better you take care of it   the better it will take care of you  
1254,1,  don garlits   the   quot big daddy quot   of drag racing   is who i think of after test driving a new   gt   before driving one   i thought of the as just another sporty looking spineless car for secretaries and factory workers to flog to work and back when we climbed into the car s black interior   i instantly noticed the exceedingly plasticky dashboard   the uncomfortable seat   the flimsy door panel   the obstructed rear view and the infant sized rear seat   although the actual driving position was nearly perfect    steering wheel   shifter and brakes were precisely where i needed them to be   i was pretty sure the car s only redeeming feature was the brand cache of the horse dancing on the grill as soon as i turned the key   i knew i was wrong   s    liter modular v   emits a tense growl through the exhaust pipes at idle   blipping the throttle was a sensory experience   even at a standstill   an engine with a snarl like this one means   business i   even if its   horsepower is lower than the perennial competitor   the camaro   i slipped the perfectly angled shifter into first and idled    no   make that   burbled   out to the road first gear came and went with a mechanical howl   and second gear did much the same   then my wife informed me    quot we re already going   quot   and so we were   in about as much time as it takes to read this   the city ended   and the road opened up into a divided highway and i explored the   mph roll on power   with a muted scream   the   stang accelerated straight up to speed at cruise   however   the mechanical noise which is so electrifying under acceleration became plain old noise   making conversation hard in the pony car   i could imagine long road trips with this car becoming an exercise in the   quot what did you say quot   maneuver but then i came to the next stoplight    yes   on a divided highway   and had a chance to dip into the v   s strong point   burnouts    a la   mr   garlits   i am proud to say that i executed a perfect right hand throttle turn   bringing the rear around smartly and hooking the tires back up to rocket off down the next road when we returned to the dealer   my heart was beginning to settle down   and we had stopped our crazy talk of canceling our order for a new volvo which at that time was in the works   summed up   the gt has a marvelous engine   transmission and brakes in search of a comparable car   because as soon as the ignition was switched off   the uncomfortable seat   creaky dashboard and all the rest were back again the wonderful   machismo   of v   s and   quot big daddy quot   burnouts simply can t overcome it   and the insurance companies who underwrite it will be happy to tell you the same thing the gt   it s a beautiful car to drive   but i couldn t imagine living with one br br  
1255,1,  i have a   mile round trip to work each day   which means a lot of wear   amp   tear in a short time   having   quot been there quot   with front wheel drive and its mechanical weaknesses   this time i wanted low tech and low maintenance   that means good ol   stone age rear wheel drive    pretty much the reason cops   amp   cabbies prefer crown vic s   the was exactly what i wanted   the v and   speed make all the power a grown up commuter could ask for   while large    l   for its output    hp   the engine makes plenty of low rev torque and will chirp its tires in second gear if asked   all while delivering a comfortable   if heavy   ride   the standard   watt stereo with cd sounds excellent   with plenty of clean volume and enough bass for anyone short of a rap fan   one thing to be aware of is that on snow or ice you will immediately be aware that this is a rear drive car   i would gladly have paid extra for the limited slip axle used on the gt s if it was available   if you do a lot of driving in these kind of conditions   you should probably consider another car   with   miles on the car   it s as solid as the day it was made   nothing has failed   malfunctioned   or broken   it was also equipped with the cleanest brakes i ve ever seen   when they re due for replacement   which won t be for a while yet   i ll actually get the replacements at a dealer    they re that good   the gt wheels that came with the sport appearance package have a durable finish and are blessed by being free of nooks and crannies that make other wheels such a chore to clean   make sure your car gets to a dealer to have a   quot silent quot   campaign fix   there is a kit available to re route the fuel hoses coming from the charcoal canister   otherwise the car has a tendency to pass a gasoline odor into the passenger compartment after the car has sloshed its fuel around in stop and go driving   it s a free fix from the factory   overall   the car is a pleasure br br  
1256,1,  i have loved mustangs since i was old enough to drive   i finally got one   it was well worth the wait   i have had more fun with this car than any other i ve driven   i bought the car used because i was just not quite ready for a brand new car   besides   mustangs always hold their worth   she is small enough that i can move in and out of traffic with ease   yet i am very comfortable when driving   the only downside is the small back seat   or at least it is a downside to my daughter who has the very long legs   the back seat does not bother me at all in the driver seat   this is a sports car and not a family vehicle   the car will really run too   not that i am a speed demon or anything   anyone who wants to have fun driving should get one   if you are a young family with small children   you may want to wait until all the kids are driving themselves   but eventually everyone should experience the fun of a   there is only one thing that i would change about my car   that is the placement of the drink cup holder   it sits directly behind my stick shift and sometimes a drink will get in my way   it needs to be back about   inches   other than that   i have the perfect car     
1257,1,  i love this car   you get the feel of a sports car   the handling of a sports car   the look of a sports car at a non sports car price   what more could one ask for   standard on the car comes the one disk cdplayer   a must for anyone these days who listens to music and the sound quality on the base model still out performs most cars   when a person thinks of a two door car the first thing that comes to mind is space   it is not a worry in this car   there is plenty of trunk space for those long trips   a middle console to hold anything from cds to papers and plenty of leg room for front seat passengers   this vehicle with its v   engine gets very good gas milage perfect for those who have long commutes to work or who just drive a lot   speaking of v   this engine gives you more bang for your buck even at   miles an hour   it feels like    the car moves with you gliding along curves and passing the competition   you are in control when driving this car   this vehicle is the perfect car for college students   young professionals   retired persons alike   the only people i do not recommend this car for you people with children because of the obvious lingistics that entails   if you are looking for a car that is just right for you   try a you will not be disappointed   
1258,1,  ever since high school i ve wanted to own a gt   i bought it two years ago with about every option imaginable and have been very happy with it overall it is a true sports car which means it was designed to drive fast and handle like a sports car not a cadillac   it s a lot of fun to drive   the seats are somewhat uncomfortable especially for long trips   if you have a bad back this is not a good every day choice for you the   liter v packs a pretty good punch    horsepower is decent   not quite as fast as the z of the same year but much better looking a few pet peeves the cup holders are ridiculous   there is one huge one which if you put a drink in there    it inevitably falls out on the floor and one smaller one which if you put your drink in it   you can t shift into second or fourth because it s blocked by your drink   don t engineers drive these cars themselves the head rest is set so far back that it might as well not be there at all sunroof was not an option   i had to install myself for an extra    br br  
1259,1,  i have the   gt and much prefer the rear end style so i was glad i didn t wait for the   to come out   the car over all is a great car and a lot of fun to drive   the only complaint i have had is that the gearbox is very tight compared to other car i have driven which initially was very frustrating the car handles very well and looks exceptionally sharp on the road   if you like to drive on windy roads   i highly recommend the standard vs   automatic for the fun of maneuvering all those curves   top down or up   this car is a lot of fun to drive over the coast highway and draws a lot of attention   mileage at    mpg is certainly acceptable for a high performance car even adding the luxury of leather seats   a high performance sound system   and   inch wheels   the price is well under   k the down side is lack of comfort in the back seat for passengers and limited trunk space   headspace is tight especially if you are tall   but over all this is a very sharp car br br  
1260,1,  first off let me say the is one fun car to drive   i have read every review of this car   and i have to say that people are buying this car for the wrong reason   if your looking for performance   then buy the gt   cobra   or saleen   you ca nt buy a cyl and complain that it doesn t drive like a gt   example   you wouldn t buy a jeep without x   buying this car one has to keep in mind that this car is for fun and speed   it is not for hauling or transporting people long distances   now with that said   on to my experiences   i recently purchased a   gt convertible   i haven t owned a new car in over   years and i was ready   after many discussions with the wife   she recommened the   i have always thought that is was a cool looking car   but i really knew nothing about it   so the search begins   i got everything i wanted except a manual transmission   i believe that a sports car should have this so you can control the throttle   but i ended up changing my mind and i don t regret my decision at all now i can hold my coffee and drive i own a ram   diesel   chevy venture van so i wanted a play car   the car stock car is very quick   handling is excellent and road noise with the convertible is minimal   again if you don t want to hear the road don t buy the conv   the cockpit is designed perfect for driving this car   even though it has seats in the back   in my opinion its a two seater   my kis however can fit back there now but the older they get the more cramped it will be   longer leg people might not like driving this car   i m     and with the seat all the way back   i just barely make it   so test drive one before you buy   the day we bought it the wife and i were going skiing   the total mileage was around   miles   i got awesome gas mileage and we weren t fatigued from driving the car   the sound system is awesome   this is one stock stereo system that is not getting taken out   the upgraded rims and tires are sweet   but will be pricey for replacement   my tires can not be rotated because they are directional tires   but i accept that   if you left this car stock   you would always have a fast sports car for a great price   but if your like me you can modify it to you taste s the mod bug has bitten me on a scale of    i give this a   have fun  
1261,1,  i got to choose a new car for my graduation present   i always wanted a but i never thought my parents would buy one for me   after looking at many types of cars i narrowed my decision down to a and a pontiac grand am   the had so many more options compared to the grand am   first of all   it comes fully loaded including power locks   power windows   cd player   automatic seats   etc   the price of the two cars were the same   but i would of been a moron to choose the grand am because it did not have to same package deal   i took the car off to college with me and found i could get most of my stuff in it because the trunk is pretty big and the back seats fold down   i recently went on a road trip with three other people in the car   i thought it would be miserable for the passengers   to our suprise   the had plenty of knee room and space to sleep in the back seat i love the storage compartments and the cell phone adaptor i have not had any problems with this car   i m very pleased with my car br br  
1262,1,  i have had f s in both    and    diesels   both have great power and reliability   the    was a   model with over    miles on it   the    is a   model   both are   wheel drive and were used on the farm to pull stock trailers   both get about the same fuel mileage   which is about   mpg highway unloaded   and about    mpg pulling a    loaded stock trailer   both also have    rear ends   which i think is a little low   but they sure do pull good   the thing i like about the   model is the   speed transmission   the   is a   speed   the bad thing about a   speed is they top out at about   or   mph   the   speed tops out at about    it has no trouble maintaining about   to   mph on level ground and slight hills   big hills will of course slow it down   but not to an unacceptable speed   s diesel engine is made by international   the powerstroke is basically a    with a turbo and modified injectors   my   has about    miles on the engine and still runs great and will not burn any oil i have been very pleased with both my next truck will probably be a f with a powerstroke br br  
1263,1,  we purchased a escort wagon brand new in    it was very economical   and although i was not ready for the   quot wagon quot   my two kids and a dog were   with soccer   baseball   volleyball and choir practice   i needed a car that i could fill with kids and or equipment and still save money on gas   this car gets great gas milage   i have safety locks on the back doors so the kids ca nt roll out into the street and a pull over shade   to hide anything in the hatch from the sun or would be theifs   i have yet to have a breakdown except when i ran out of gas lol   and other than a problem with the ghost in the dome light   this has been a great family car   i did have the dome light replaced   only to continue having the problem of it coming on sporatically   now i have it turned off entirely   with that one problem   i feel i am doing pretty well   this car has been a wonderful car for a family that could nt afford a luxury car   the ride is smooth and seating is plenty   good mid income family value br br  
1264,1,  the   escort is highly reliable   but somewhat less impressive to be seen in than its distant cousin   the the compact has a very small turning radius   which   in city driving   is crucial   another benefit for city drivers is the way the escort holds its alignment   after     years of driving the pothole laced monroe ave   in rochester   ny   and discovering many of the previously mentioned potholes   i have yet to need an alignment   the escort s sturdy frame is a surprise   but this   banger s pep keeps pace with that surprise   its speed   however   does not keep pace with radar or ny state troopers   police band radios   caution is needed for the heavy footed   unless you opt for the cruise control feature the trunk   likewise   is surprisingly roomy   with enough room to pack for a weekend getaway with a clotheshorse spouse and an infant s accessories   the trunk is also accessible through the fold down rear seat   which gives much needed added room when bringing x s home from the hardware store on the down side   the driver s seat is just enough off center to help your chiropractor keep up the payments on his timeshare   additionally   the headlights tend to go out a little too often the escort   though   is sweet on gas   scoring nearly   mpg in stop and go driving   and   with its front wheel drive   it s an economical option to suv s for winter driving br br  
1265,1,  the precursor to the highly touted focus   the escort is a small   economical car   my   escort is a dr with a small engine but can really crank out the gas mileage   even today   with    miles i average around    miles a gallon   i have relied on this car for two years to drive me   hours to college and make multiple road trips the only problems i have encountered in   years of used car ownership have been minor electrical problems with the dome light and trunk light   i also needed to buy a special cd player installation kit from circuit city when i put in sound system   however   even the base speakers pack a punch in a little body the best part about my model is that the back seats fold down   creating a massive amount of trunk space   and wide enough area to fit long objects   like my hockey sticks   if your concern is that it appears to be a weak    grocery getter   rest assured the designers did a good job creating a trendy   smooth look   the dr models with a spoiler and moon roof and the dr zx are also very stylish the   escort is the perfect first or second car for young drivers and a reliable auto for anyone  
1266,1,  i really enjoy my little red   escort   the size seems just about perfect for easy handling   for one thing   also   the heater works very well to warm the car up fairly quickly on a cold day   faster than my mother s taurus   my aunt actually picked this car out for me as it was a moderately priced used vehicle   bought may   for      the only things i don t like about it are minor   i don t like the cup holders   anything larger than a   small   can tips over when you turn sharply   also   the gear shift will smash larger cups when you put the car in park   the horn also seems to require a lot of pressure to get it to honk   it has a nice rear window defrost   i also enjoy the remote control trunk and the foldable back seats   driving is very pleasant   the car is comfortable and responds well   the model i own is a   door   perfect for my family of    anyone who likes a maneuverable   comfortable small car should buy it   i suppose those with large families or hauling needs shouldn t  
1267,1,  my wife and i live paycheck to paycheck just like most of the world does and our current car was falling apart quick   so when we decided that that we needed a new car we sat down and talked about what we wanted   with a tight budget we knew our choices were limited   all i wanted was an american car with a tape deck   she wanted a car with four doors   since we had a   year old and one more on the way   and an air conditioner since we lived in georgia at the time   i was very stern about buying american because that s what keeps out country running and i feel that every time you buy something foreign an american worker loses his job   so we checked out the dealerships for     gmc   saturn     jeep and many others   we looked all around looking for the cheapest and the best car we could find   once we looked at the escort we knew that s what we wanted   it had everything we needed   four doors for easy access to the loading and unloading of kids   an air conditioner and a tape deck for me   the interior and exterior are holding up pretty good after   years but nothing is child proof   the engine is still in good condition after    miles in   years   routine maintenance conducted regularly   but the leg room leaves something to be desired   granted the leg room isn t anything like a geo metro or a festiva where your knees are in your chest   you have enough room to move around and not get cramps but i wouldn t try stretching out to much br br  
1268,1,  i surprised myself when i ended up buying a used   escort last year   i was in the market for a new used car   but i had sworn to myself and my dad that i wouldn t get an escort   we had an   or   when i was a kid and it was one of the most atrociously ugly cars i ve ever seen   it looked like a small happy meal box on wheels   or maybe just a tanks   well   to get to the point one afternooon i was at a used car dealership and saw a silver   escort in my price range   the main reason i chose to test drive it   aside from it being silver my favorite car color   was to get my dad to stop bugging me about one   miraculously   i realized it was a great car while i was driving it   it has decent pickup for a car in its class and has wonderful handling   i bought it that very afternoon i m still very happy with my purchase   though i ve had a few small problems with it since i bought it   the service engine light came on repeatedly the first couple of months and then we found out the light itself had gone bad   i recently had the check coolant light come on from time to time   but that stopped once i had the radiator serviced overall   it is a great car for someone who doesn t have a lot of money to spend on a car   but wants something sort of nice that handles well oh   and the title of this review is   quot hillary quot   because i have a   quot hillary for senate quot   bumpersticker on my escort   and it seems to be its new name br br  
1269,1,  you love your wife   but sometimes she eats too much i love my   explorer xlt   it is nice   attractive   strong and quiet   i bought this car to have my family in a secure vehicle when on road   before buying this car i tested similar suvs such as toyota runner   nissan pathfinder   blazer and mitsubishi montero the explorer comes loaded with a bunch of features you will not easily find on other suv   i love the knob activated four wheel drive that allows me to turn it on at any time or any speed without stopping the car   this is useful when it starts raining and you want your tires to stick to the pavement   the engine is powerful enough to handle the truck   but may be a little less responsive in short accelerations   i corrected this problem with the installation of a powerjet    there is not other suv that offers the comfort   luxury and beauty of a explorer   this is a car to fall in love   everything is powered   the back seat radio and air conditioning console is definitely a plus mileage is definitely an issue   the explorer eats too much   my average consumption improved a little after i installed the powerjet the ride inside the explorer is quiet   soft and smooth   you can barely hear the or the transmission   it took me a while to know how to handle it   it drives amazingly well in straight roads even at mph   but you have to be careful when cornering i had a transmission problem during the warranty period   sort of a solenoid was replaced   few months later they replaced the gas pump solenoid too i recommend this truck to any family that wants comfort security and adventure   the explorer is great for long trips and its cargo area fits more stuff than you could imagine   believe me   my wife brings the whole house into the car when we go on vacation   my wife loves the sense of security this car provides and she can handle it easily recently i decided to sell my explorer and went looking for another suv with better mileage   none of the year   models i saw   could barely compare in features to my explorer   i still keep it   it is a vehicle you want forever   just like a wife even if she eats too much br br  
1270,1,  the explorer is a very tricky car   when i first bought it   it was as if it was a dream   it drives like no other   and its very comfortable   but after a few months of driving   it began breaking down   and loosing parts very fast   not only did it stall all the time   and had to change light bulbs   batteries etc   the cost became very great   since i was having to fix it all the time   it got expensive   the parts where also expensive   the car is a very safe car   but you can not take corners fast   it topples over easily   it is a very top heavy car   it has room   and has a big engine   it handles nice in the snow   over all i give it a three out of five stars   
1271,1,  if you love quality   and you love comfort   this is the vehicle for you it s not only sporty but it has many luxuries to go along with it i don t personally own this vehicle   but i had it for about a month   it was my bosses   i used to have to drive him around and things like that   the particular explorer that he had was a   with the eddie bauer package   what a nice truck   it had leather interior    wd   the handling of it was excellent   i d driven through some snowy messes that i know i would have never made it through with my car   and that truck just went through it like it was nothing   this truck also got great gas milage   i can t really give exact numbers right now   i don t remember   but i do know that for the amount of driving that i had done   it didn t take as much gas as i had thought it would   no different than what my car takes   it handles well on the highway   or over rugged mountain roads   either way you go   you have great control   another feature i liked about this truck was the fact that it told you in digital numbers what the temperature was outside   what direction you were going and everything   it tells you how soon you need to refuel   when you need your next oil change etc   for instance say you put in   gallons of gasoline   you drive a little while and look at the meter   it will tell you that you have   gallons left   great idea   i like that   power windows   power locks   combination lock on the door   if you forget your key   all great features of this wonderful truck   as for cons   i never found any   i would recommend this to anyone who wants a sporty vehicle   but yet solid   safe and sound   if you don t know if you d want to own one   just go test drive one someday   you ll see what i m talking about br br  
1272,1,  i own a   explorer with leather interior and all the options   it is a classy looking suv that is luxurious to drive   it has smooth handling and and has been very reliable   cornering is ok but sometimes tippy on very sharp turns   four wheel drive is excellent for winter conditions   especially slippery stop and goes i would not recommend this vehicle for someone who is planning to drive on rough terrain   it is very bumpy on rough roads and is better for road driving people who should buy this vehicle are small families   individuals who are worried about driving in winter conditions   and anyone who camps or participates in outdoor activities such as skiing or biking overall   this is a great vehicle to own because it is a nice ride   is asthetically pleasing   is good in winter conditions   and has luxurious options   
1273,1,  after buying and driving small cars   hondas   saturns   even an mg for the past twenty years i was uncertain about going the suv route   but   as my interests now require me to have more room for hauling around equipment   i scuba dive i needed a vehicle that had more room the explorer has all the room one needs yet also has the   quot car quot   feel i was so afraid to lose   as i also commute over   miles per day to work this vehicle has gotten a rigorous workout     miles in three years   and has not given me a single headache it truly is a utility vehicle   it has the class and looks for going to a formal wedding yet makes itself right at home at the camp ground   i am not a rugged individual   actually a short   year old woman   this vehicle has not only changed the way i feel about suv s and trucks in general i will most certainly purchase another suv   and probably another explorer   when the time to trade in come around   but after over    miles the car looks and drives like new   so that may not be for quite sometime br br  
1274,1,  puschased used with    miles   this is an xlt model and is one of the best vehicles i have ever owned   in the st   months   i have driven about    miles and have had no problems   i have had to replace   tail light bulbs and the battery   regular service has included power stearing fluid change   transmission fluid change   radiator cleaned and flushed and   wiper blades in addition to regular oil changes with mobil   w oil   excellent the remote outside mirrors leave no blind spots when properly adjusted   handling is excellent   stearing is responsive and predictable   it is one of the smoothest riding vehicles i have ever owned   twice in this time i have moved   and   miles and found the cargo capacity excellent   even fully loaded   the handling is smooth   i like the option of opening the rear glass or the whole tailgate   the seats are cloth and very comfortable   this vehicle has power seats with lumbar and calf support which allows very comfortable adjustments   in my opinion this is an excellent choice for anyone who needs the ability to haul children and or stuff   front rear seating is ample and comfortable   head and leg room superior to most i have driven   gas mileage is good   wind noise above   mph moderate would recommend this suv highly   since it has dual air bags   small children should only ride in the back seat   auto   wheel drive excellent for rail snow ice br br  
1275,1,  in   i needed a new vehicle and since i already owned an   explorer i decided to go and see what more it had to offer quot oh my god quot   was i shocked   quot this explorer is awesome quot   i fell deeply in love with something that is not human i had to take it for a test drive well i did and i paid cash on the spot   i couldn t believe how nice this vehicle is and to this day i will not give up this vehicle as a matter of fact i m in the market for a new one now   and i just can t wait but i have to at least one more week i m here to tell you that the ride and the feeling of being behind the wheel is such an experience that you will want to cherish forever and you ll try to keep it to yourself but you just can t do it   because once you drive it you just want to keep on going forever and you ll have to tell someone your awesome experience quot that you will never forget quot sooner than later the explorer has everything that i could ever dream of having in a car such as cd player air cruse the best ride i ve found yet smooth when you want it fast when needed easy visuals and in dash equipment and much much much much more i ll tell you this quot if you like feeling in control or like going offroad or just taking a sunday ride   or going shopping in comfort style and knowing you ll be fine in the snow and be seen in awwwwed then this is the ride for you     
1276,1,  i had a   explorer with all of the toys   i really enjoyed this vehicle   however   it does have its faults   it s towing capability isn t good   the in line   doesn t have enough power   i know your saying why didn t you get the v   i ll tell you   to get an explorer with a v i lose the option of wd   if would have not went to awd with the v i would have gotten it   it s offroad capabilty it s great either   low ground clearance and poor shocks are   faults so if your looking for a sport utility to drive like a car and get car like gas mileage get an explorer   if you want a suv to kick some butt   i d look at a durango   i have a durango now br br  
1277,1,  well what to say about the explorer limited besides that it is great   i recently bought a   explorer limited with    miles for      which i consider a very good price considering that kelly blue book value is      kellybluebook since the limited is top of the line   the interior is luxurious and comfortable   there is an electronic control center that gives me such information as gas usage and oil information as well as much other useful info   i bought this explorer for it s handsome looks   widespread popularity   and size   it does what i want when i want it to   i also like how my passengers in the back receive rear air   an option in xlt and up   also the windows in the back go farther down than a chevy tahoe   the explorer is capabale of off roading   i know so because i have gone off roading   it is not the best but does what any soccer mom sport utility is capable of   the running boards hit a lot of times when heading off the trail   so if y ou plan on off roading   then do not get them   also the factory running boards are narrow and hard to use   i do not recommend them   an aftermarket supplier can supply great ones   now let s hear about the cons   the engine   i would definetly go with the v in   the v was not available so i have a    v with   horsepower   my wifes   taurus se has a   horsepower v   also   some of the interior is plastic feeling and kinda cheap looking   i have had no problems and my carfax report was    clear   i definetly recommend this versatile sport utility to anyone with the need for it or for anyone who wants some comfortable driving br br  
1278,1,  with    in citibank dollars to apply toward the purchase of my   eddie bauer x explorer   it was hard to choose another suv   however   i test drove all the rest   at that time   the chevy blazer had the smoothest ride   but the inside had too much plastic   the toyota runner was hot   but close to     more than a comparably equipped explorer   also   i discovered that the insurance on a runner was    year higher   after    miles   my explorer has operated with zero defects   other than changing the oil every three thousand miles   and one thorough servicing     at    miles   i haven t spent a dime maintaining this truck   the paint has held up to the abuses of street parking in los angeles and san francisco   the ride is a bit rough for those looking for more of a car than a truck   if i had to do it over   i would have waited until   to get the larger v   the hp v in my explorer is pretty weak and a hp v was offered in    other than that   the interior is extremely comfortable   the eddie bauer package includes power   leather seats with power lumbar support    an excellent feature for long drives   this is a solid truck that is proving to be a great value br br  
1279,1,  i bought my explorer for basically one main reason   more space   i had previously owned a   pontiac grand prix gtp   door and its small back seat was cramping for my large dog   max    he now has plenty of windows to look out and tons of room to move around as he desires   it s also nice being able to go to sam s club and fit everything i   my mother     my sister purchase into one car   this suv has outweighed my expectations   it heats up quickly in freezing weather   has minimal maintenance problems   and smooth ride   this vehicle fits into my life well i am very much amazed at the reliability of my explorer   i bought my   explorer used in september    with    miles on it   and two days ago it hit     i was amazed to have gone    miles without a single problem except for nails in my tire   those    miles weren t easy either   mostly driving through downtown chicago s bumpy streets on my way to college   this vehicle also has plenty of room for all necessary activities   shopping   clothes    groceries   nights out in downtown chicago   carting around my   lb chocolate laborador   helping friends move   driving to school   camping   etc   etc   this vehicle s looks are stylish and rugged at the same time and perfect for any occasion   my only complaint with this vehicle is its horrible gas consumption   i drive approximately   miles a week   city    suburb   and have to fill the   gallon tank up each week   all of the explorer s amenities outweigh this one drawback   and make me feel completely satisfied with this purchase  
1280,1,  i replaced my totaled ramcharger with a   bronco xlt   i looked around carefully    read my review entitled   quot before you talk turkey   inspect the bird quot     i found what has been a gem the truck had high mileage for a   year old machine   but that did not seem a problem   a check on the previous owner   and contact with him   confirmed that the truck had been used for a   mile commute   all highway driving this bronco has all the amenities you think you are driving around in a four wheel drive lincoln   all the power accessories bothered me   they tend to break   so far   after     years   none have   i ve put over    miles on the vehicle since buying it it has the overdrive automatic transmission   so at   miles per hour   the engine is running at under   rpm and can get up to    mpg if i leave the cruise control on   x tires   the overall average is about      i do a lot of highway driving i noted in another review by a mechanic comments about the cost of repairs in the areas of ball joints and exhaust systems   he s right    if you need exhaust headers replaced in a late model bronco   it s a major job   you can get ball joints with lube points   so if you replace the original set with these   then keep them lubed   they will last a long time   by the way when you have ball joints done   have the front axle u joints replaced while the whole thing is apart the other aspect of front suspension component wear are the twin i beam control arms   the key things that get loose are the large control arm bushings that stabilize the rear of the arms   these arms in turn stabilize the twin i beam front axle system   the right side is the most likely to have problems    it s close to exhaust system components   and there are heat shielding bushing collars that protect the rubber part of the bushings   over time   the right side rubber bushing can get mushy from heat exposure   just keep an eye on it another thing to think about    this applies to broncos with serpentine belts   and any other vehicle so equipped     periodically check the belt   and remove it to make sure that the things it turns are without bearing or bushing noise and shaft play   make sure the idler and tension pulley bushings are good   if something freezes up   you are sol   carry a spare serpentine belt if you travel in remote areas the key to owning a bronco   and really   any other vehicle   is in the maintenance program   since in some areas   there s more to an suv than a regular vehicle   there are added maintenance points that need to be attended to one of the things that you must do is to periodically lock the hubs and drive a while   if your bronco is equipped with the auto locking hubs   you can not do this unless in four wheel drive   so you have to be off road   the auto locking hubs are a nice convenience    but one of the first things i did was to replace them with warn manual locking hubs   the auto locking hubs can result in too little exercise for the front axle u joints   once these joints start getting twitchy from lack of exercise   they can cause the auto hubs to lock falsely   the off road performance of the bronco is good   it has gone everywhere i wanted to go with no complaints or difficulties   by the way    if you are one of those who likes   quot mudding quot     remember that that mud gets into things and can reduce longevity unless properly cleaned out this is another truck that the manufacturer has discontinued in favor of fancier   more expensive rigs aimed at the yuppie market   it s a shame    it s a good truck    was the last model year if you are looking for a strong machine that still has some   not all   of the simplicity of the basic pickup truck   the bronco can serve you well br br  
1281,1,  we originally bought the bronco because it suited our family needs   the wife and i have   growing boys and   dogs   the bronco is a great vehicle to comfortably haul the whole crew around it is also surprisingly easy to drive   with power everything   the size of the vehicle is generally not an issue   we love the easy viewing from on high and the basic ruggedness the bronco even makes a nice cross country traveler   getting about   miles to the gallon on the highway unfortunately   the in town mileage tends to hover around   mpg   it is a thirsty beast the quality of the vehicle was generally good   but we did have one major complaint   before the    mile mark   we replaced the front brake rotors and calipers because they had warped   this caused an annoying pulsing sensation when braking   we took it to several times   where they would turn the rotors only to have them warp again within the next   miles or so   after   trips to   we went to aftermarket components   sperry   which cured the problem and actually provided better feel than stock   cost was     the bronco is a vehicle that gives a lot of satisfaction   but is not necessarily going to be cheap to feed or maintain   we would recommend it to folks who really need a rugged   powerful suv and are willing to pay for it br br

1283,1,  due to a combination of circumstances with which i will not bore my busy audience   it was recently necessary that i make a trip from boston   ma to atlanta   ga and back   a journey of some   odd miles each way   due to the amount of luggage that needed to make the trip as well   flying was prohibitively expensive   and due to that same quantity of luggage none of the cars owned by the four parties involved were large enough   so the decision was made to rent a minivan   the automobile chosen was the   windstar   and having now spent a total of    hours driving and riding in the vehicle through sun   rain and fog at all hours of the day and night   i have prepared a brief sketch detailing my thoughts   after all   i might as well have something to show for my absence from epinions   right as a passenger i must first note that i found the rear seats   which are pretty comfortable for basic sitting   a little firm   but not unpleasantly so   to be almost impossible to sleep on   since we were taking turns with the driving and going straight through a   hour trip after not having slept a whole lot the night before   this distance is from ct to atlanta we rested after the three hour trip from boston to ct   it would have been very helpful if the drivers to be could have gotten some sleep while waiting for their shifts   but this was extremely difficult   this is partly due to the fact that the back seats are bucket seats and are placed about six inches away from the inside wall of the car normally i like to lean against the door with a pillow to sleep in a vehicle   but this was impossible in the windstar   this may seem minor   but i considered it a serious flaw due to the situation   on the return trip we left at    pm and drove all night   so comfortable seats for sleeping would definitely have been helpful for those who do not anticipate spending a lot of time sleeping in the back seat this may not be much of an issue   but if you are ever considering renting one for a trip   as we did   i would say that this factor definitely warrants consideration as all four of us had a lot of trouble getting any rest while on the road   the front seat   which is set against the door in the usual manner   was a little better for sleeping   but it still proved hard to find a good position   the firm seats don t really yield well to any position other than sitting upright   so any sort of slouching or leaning in an attempt to nod off is not welcomed by the car i should note that the vehicle has a removable second back seat which is a bench seat we rented it without this to leave more room for the cargo   but that one may well be more comfortable for napping than the two rear bucket seats we had the front seats are easily adjustable to a wide range of angles handy since three people of varying heights were taking turns at driving and the rear seats recline pretty far back   although   not to belabor a point   this somehow did not prove helpful when it came to sleeping as a passenger in the back seat i also noticed that it swayed quite a bit in the rear   i could often feel it lurching a little from side to side due to wind   swerves   etc   but this was barely noticeable in the front seats and did not seem to affect the vehicle s handling i drove the windstar for the most part on highways   the little city driving i did was unremarkable i mostly noticed that i was more uncomfortable with the vehicle in town because with more other cars closer to me the size of it became more noticeable and i am not used to driving a large car   but it handled smoothly and braked well   i am always interested in brakes   and since i managed not to sideswipe anyone i consider the adventure a success out on the highway it took a little while to get up to cruising speed   probably about average pickup for a large vehicle   although i don t have much to compare it with   and lost a little speed when going up hills   but when cruising on a flat road it performed admirably   there was no noticeable difference in feel between   and   mph   and occasionally and briefly up to    the ride stayed smooth and the noise level   it was always a little loud   but conversation was still possible between front and back seats with a little raising of the voice   remained the same   this was sometimes a bit of a problem when i would glance down and notice that i was going   without meaning to   but once i learned to keep a close eye on the speedometer i could only admire the smooth way it handled high speeds   it is also equipped with cruise control   so if you like to use it this would also have solved that problem personally i prefer to moderate speed manually   but i also prefer standard transmission   just a control freak   i guess   the windstar   of course   is an automatic   and i can report that transmission was smooth and quiet it does take rather wide turns   and turning feels a little tricky at high speeds   but then   no matter what you re driving you should be careful around turns at   mph   but otherwise the handling at highway speeds was very nice   i did find that i had a tendency to drift a little to the right   although this may be my own fault rather than anything to do with the car   and there is a marked blind spot on the right side   but the car was always responsive and i never felt in danger of losing control this remained true even in pouring rain   aside from sometimes speeding like a maniac   i am a cautious driver and tend to be wary of wet roads   but i felt firmly in control of the windstar   after reducing speed a little to about   mph   even in the middle of a downpour changing lanes was a little nerve wracking at first when moving to the left since the side of the vehicle is so long   but once you get used to it there should be no problem   likewise   backing up was a challenge since i wasn t used to looking through such a long interior to the rear window   and parking was interesting   but these are all issues that would quickly be resolved if i had time to get really accustomed to driving a larger vehicle we had to refuel   times during the trip   including once to fill the tank before returning the car to the rental agency   we spent about     each time   and concluded that we got decent gas mileage for a large vehicle cargo space   without the third row of seats   was pretty much exactly adequate for our needs   we were carrying two large cardboard boxes   five backpack sized bags of personal effects   several smaller bags of snacks and odds and ends   a video camera   a microphone case   a couple of poster tubes and some lumber   this filled up all the space with little room left over   but did not take up enough room to interfere with vision through the rear window   i would estimate that the size would be adequate for most general moving needs there are also many nice little nooks and crannies to store things elsewhere in the van   including little cubbies between both front and rear seats   a cd holder up front   a coin holder on the ceiling   etc   the cup holders in front were a little flimsy looking   but did the job   cup holders in back were more solid and were a nice touch since we jointly consumed about   bottles of water and soda on the journey   we were also entertained by a little fold out mirror that allows people in the front to keep an eye on the back seats   we didn t have a whole lot of use for it   but it would probably be handy for those with lively   squirming children i should mention that this vehicle has a sliding door on each side providing access to the back seats   rather than the usual right side only door   this is a major selling point for   i think   and i can report that it was indeed very handy not to have anyone having to climb over seats to get inside   we also liked the fact that the child safety lock feature   which prevents the side doors from being opened from the inside   was easy to turn off   just flip a lever on the edge of the sliding door once it s open the controls were fairly standard   lights on a dial   turn signal and windshield wipers on a lever on the steering column   emergency brake below   etc   the gear shift is on the steering column   which some people like and some don t   personally i don t have a strong preference either way as long as it gets the job done   which this did there were no aspects of the controls that we found to be odd or hard to get used to in the short time we were driving the vehicle we had slight problems with the temperature   but only because i am always cold and everyone else in the car was always hot   mechanically   the climate control worked just fine   there is even a separate control dial to give a different temperature for the back than the front   we didn t really do a stringent test of this function   since everyone but me was agreed on a cool temperature   but at one point we did try warming the back for those people trying to sleep while keeping the front cool to maintain alertness in the driver   and it seemed to work i obviously can not speak to any issues that might arise as the vehicle gets to be a few years older   we had no mechanical problems   but it would have been surprising if we had   since the car was practically brand new and rented to boot   and there could be age related problems down the line that we will never know about i can not give a recommendation on whether to buy or not buy based on my experience   but i can offer advice to anyone considering renting a vehicle to haul a bunch of stuff or several people   that advice would be   go for it if you re not planning to need sleep   but if you re going to be in it for the long haul i would seriously suggest looking for something with more comfortable seats   i would give the windstar   stars in general for speediness   control   carrying capacity and gas mileage   but due to the unpleasant experience with the seats i can only give it three   again   this may seem a small issue   but all four of us agreed that the inability to sleep in the seats was a problem on the long drive   and i personally would think twice before renting another windstar for any extensive trip otherwise   i have no fault to find with the vehicle   which performed admirably in the few days we had it and since i can think of no more to say   here ends my song of the rented windstar  
1284,1,  since our family has multiplied from   to    we knew it was time to drive a car that could carry all of our stuff   so out we went test driving everything under the sun until we came across a bright red windstar   minivan   i do mean bright red   at first i was not crazy about the color   but since we live in a town with a bunch of crazy drivers   at least they can t miss us pulling out it was a cold yucky day   so when we popped into this vehicle the sales guy gave us the key and started the engine   while we were sitting in the parking lot the van quickly got warm this was a good sign   the front and the back are on two different temperature controls   the front passengers can decide the temperature for the whole crew or give the control to whoever is sitting in the back the seats are incredible   after owning a jetta vw and mazda   for what seems like forever   we love these seats   we can t wait for our next big trip from south carolina to ohio or florida   my friend just bought a explorer and after her last long trip she is ready to trade it in and get a windstar   she loves to ride in it   and so do all of the neighborhood kids i still can t get over how roomy this minivan is   when you are in the vehicle you feel like you can stretch out and really enjoy the ride   if you need to   you or your passenger can pop into the back without getting out of the vehicle   of course after the vehicle has come to a full and complete stop   this helps on big trips   but if and when you need to get out the interior lights can be switched to the sleeping baby mode so that only the floor lights will light up as far as removing seats   my husband does that   he says that they are heavy and we are not quite sure where we would store them if we have to remove them while we were away from home   that is why the mazda mvp is better in that department   their back seat folds into the bottom of the floor board   that is a nice feature that i hope becomes a standard next on all minivans   two doors   need i say more   i am not quite sure how   without getting into the minivan   i would buckle in   children with only   door if you are ready to plunge into the family minivan make sure you get a minivan with at least these options    power windows for the front and the back   so on hot days you can open the back windows to let the hot air escape and close to keep in the air conditioning    dark tinted windows to keep some of hot sun out and children s goofy offending faces in    two control panels for the temperature controls   one for the front and one for the back   you the driver will always have the main control    try to get a light as possible colored car if you live like us in the south   the darker the car the faster it will heat up in the hot   hot sun    test drive as many cars as you can stand   take your time and remember to have your vehicle checked by a good mechanic   there are a lot of lemons out there and you have to be careful with whatever car you purchase  
1285,1,  i recently purchased a   zx and even though i have only had the vehicle for about a month i am very happy with its performance the reason for choosing this vehicle was after my wife had read the consumer report on the vehicle we felt that safety was an important feature and this car seemed to be just that   the car has a very sporty look to it and the size is just right for a smaller family   the price also was very reasonable and with the trade in on my grand am and the cash bonus my final price was just under      in this day of high gas prices this was another reason for my choice   my zx is a   cylinder   but i was very surprised with the power it still has   going up hill does not seem to be a problem for this car and the smooth ride for the size is just right for me   after checking gas mileage around town i am averaging about   miles to the gallon   i live in an area with many hills and with that type of mileage i was very pleased   as far as the safety i spoke of earlier the vehicle seems to be built very solid and that was very important to me   if you are like me you read all you can on something before you spend a numerous amount of money   so even though i have only had this vehicle a month i am very pleased to say i am happy with my purchase  
1286,1,  it finally arrived   i waited nine months for to fill my order for a   t bird   it was love at first sight   and at first drive i m someone who does not know a lot about mechanics   but is impressed by detail and design   the   t bird is obviously a car engineered with passion   from the powerful and firm suspension right down to the chrome trimmed cup holders   this is a car that exudes style and quality this car drives nearly silent with the optional hard top on   take the hard top off and it is still very quiet inside   even at highway speeds   conversation is easy   though the fantastic bose stereo system with cd changer may have you cranking up the tunes   makes a big point of saying that this car is a   cruiser   and not intended to be a porshe like sports car   it s a car to drive around town in and a car to enjoy a road trip   what is surprising is that the tight suspension and responsive v   do give the driver a real thrill   it s all the performance i could possibly use in a car   and i m not gentle with the gas when i drive a car if you are worried about room inside   don t be   i m     and the car is comfortable and fun   with or without the hard top on   it is even more fun without the top   of course   this really is a two seater   though   it s a good size car   so many people assume that there must be a small seat or shelf hidden back there   there is not   the trunk is surprisingly spacious   i haven t put my clubs in it yet   but i don t anticipate a problem   my father   who owned one of the   s that inspired the    recently told me    everyone should own a car like this once in their life   it s true   this car is a thing of beauty   a bit of advice   california dealers were marking up the t birds        depending on the color   so   i ordered mine from a florida dealer   had them ship it to me   and paid very close to sticker   if you really want this car   be patient   they all get built at the same factory   so check around the country for the dealer willing to give you the best price october update to this review   i ve got a couple of thousand miles on the t bird now really driven this car   it s better than ever   no regrets on this purchase   though the trunk is small   i regularly cart around two sets of golf clubs   i ve driven the car three hundred miles in a single day and found it comfortable   the sound system is just amazing   now that it is   broken in   it sounds just fantastic   i actually prefer listening to cds in the car   rather than my home theater system   lessons learned   carry sunscreen in the car and a leather jacket in the trunk and it s almost never necessary to put up the top   now that the engine has a few thousand miles on it   i drive the car more aggressively   wow   what a blast   this thing hauls   the low center of gravity and wide tires also makes for nice cornering   what is really interesting is how people react to this piece of new americana   older folks remember the   s t birds and are happy to see   it s back   the younger skateboarding crowd often yell   cool car   when i drive by and i wonder if they even know that this car is based on a s style   six months after my purchase   i still strongly recommend this vehicle   my advice remains the same   though   don t pay a big mark up on the vehicle   they are out there and you can ship a car across country for a couple hundred bucks   i had mine built at from and order placed by a florida dealer and then shipped to a fleet center in dublin   california   i never met the salesman i bought the car from   but then again i didn t pay the     mark up my local dealer wanted to charge me   be patient   this car is worth waiting for  
1287,1,  my husband loves jaguars   he has a current lease on an s type   has been to tour their factories in england   and has numerable collectables and trinkets adorning our home   tantamount to his love of this legendary car   so why am i writing about a escape   because it took a will and determination equal to his passion to convince him not to renew his lease on another jaguar   ok   all you fellow jag nuts can come assassinate me now   but at least hear me out first   our s type was riddled with problems   and has had no less than three major   hospital   visits in the two years it has lived with us   and this does not count the time i had a teeny tiny little scrape up   and had to have the rear bumper replaced oops   nor does this count the numerous times we had to take it in for minor repairs   i wo nt go into detail of our woes now   that will be for another review   but suffice it to say   i was ready for something with a little more reliability   so   we set off on a quest for a car that fit our bill of needs   sporty   stylish   a luxurious feel   and   not at all in the least   coverage by s a plan   aah   yes   the limiting factor   and so we ended up at the escape b the car   my new escape is a brand new    wd limited model   with both available options of the power moonroof and the trailer towing package   this model escape comes complete with a   liter   v engine   i chose the silver color   more on my husband s insistance than anything else   i would have preferred black   for a sleeker look   the interior is black leather b appearance   i   outside    the escape is not an ugly small suv   but its overall outward appearance is rather boxy by my standards   this is compounded by the lack of plastic   fenders   on the limited model   which are a distinguishing identifier of the xlt and xls models   apparantly thinks that a monotone body looks more stylish and   upperclass    but i think the black edging gives the bottom of the car a finished look   i don t know how this will translate into long term preservation of the car s finish   but i expect the bottom of the car may show more dings and scratches   and be more prone to rust   in addition   all escapes have a rather high   square   hind end   this adds to the boxy appearance   but does mean more storage space in the cargo area   so it is an equitable trade off     inside    the inside of the limited escape has a much more luxurious feel than the outside   it feels quite roomy   and the front passenger seating area seems to have as much space as the larger explorer   the black leather seats are quite nice   both looks wise and in comfort   the simulated leather trim on the dash   however   does not uphold the luxury car appearance   it is too grainy   and puckered in some places   i don t know what would have worked better   since real leather or wood probably would have put the car outside of its price class   perhaps a simulated wood could have done the trick   the driver controls panel is somewhat stylish by day   the round   white windows look rather futuristic   but the effect is ruined at night   rather than continuing to glow their opalescent white   they turn black   with illuminated dials and numbers in the oh so christmasy green and red   personally   i think the white   glow bug   look is much nicer   and some neon blue dials would have completed the look nicely   the   piece de resistance    of the dash area is the silver temperature audio console   it contrasts nicely with the black surface covering   and greatly adds to the   luxury   feel of the car   this takes up most of the middle area of the front dash   and is complete with   cd in dash changer   tuner   air temperature controls and vents   and storage pockets   some of which seem more useful than others the backseat and cargo areas are also quite nice   the pockets on the back of the front seats look to be quite useful for children s accessories   and the rear seat headrests are a nice   and not often seen feature   the cargo area is roomy   with plenty of headspace for tall objects   there is also a stylish roll up style cover   which can be pulled over low lying objects for privacy   this can be rolled up when not in use   and even removed entirely the entire interior has a uniform feel   with its black leather seating and dash surfaces   and black plush carpeting covering the floors   mats   cargo area   and front face of rear seats   and the tinted windows and moonroof complete the mood lit effect of being in a dark car b functionality   i comfort   sitting in this car is quite nice   the driver seat is fully adjustable in so many ways it would be hard not to find a good fit   one thing i don t understand is why there are no power controls on the passenger side seat   and why the power controls don t extend to the lumbar support and seat tilt on the driver side   really   if you re going to go power   please just go all the way   however   all power controls are close at hand   including those to the windows and moonroof   and one touch butt warmers   so nice   and this ease of use extends to the space age silver temp audio console   everything is within reach and self explanatory   no muddling about with buttons trying to figure out what does which   one control which is not in the best location is the all too important gear shift   come on guys   why make the gear shift handle block the view of the gear shift indicator   being a new car   i don t yet have a good feel of where drive   neutral   etc   are   and it is quite disconcerting to have to move my head around to see what gear i have shifted too   i am sure this is something that will come to bother me less in time   as i develop a feel for the car   but right now it is an irritating testament to quality   or not   the backseat is also quite roomy and comfortable   even for a full size adult   which i am not   measuring in at a mere   ft tall   but even my husband had room to move his feet around   this comfort tested out for both the side and middle seats   so there should be minimal fussing over which child goes where   as far as storage areas go   this car offers plenty   the glove box and armrest console are quite roomy   and there is some storage built in for cd cases   there are   potentially useful bins underneath the audio console   one with an extra power jack   and   good sized cupholders   one of which holds a removable ashtray   this would give you room for a cell phone   sunglasses   and some change   but looks prone to collecting semi useless junk that wo nt quite stay in place   one nice feature is the press able garage door opener holder that sits above the rear view mirror   the rear cargo area   as stated before   also seems quite useful   and the rear seats fold down to allow for oversized objects i practicality    well   the guts of this review should be how well this car works and drives   and here it is   although i can t promise this will show off my reviewing ability to its finest   i am not a car connoisseur   and i know little about the mechanical innards that make them go   i am writing this from the point of view of your average driver   not an expert on the subject by any means   well   with the disclaimer in place   here goes   i am a truck driver by nature   having graduated to my escape from a splash   and i was unsure of how i would like the   car chassy   feel of the escape   well   i like it   i can t say that it drives like my truck   but it does have a similar feel   including the better visibility that comes with the extra height   the car has a nice amount of pick up   but it does take some time to switch gears   about   seconds after i think it should have   which can be slightly disconcerting   once going   the car cruises along quite happily   without any feel of a struggle   i have read in some reviews that there is excessive wind noise   however i did not find this to be the case   perhaps it is because i am used to trucks   which tend to be louder than cars   the car has some nice driving features   my favorite of which is the wd   i am used to the   option wd     off   low   or high   with appropriate measures needed to switch from one to the other   this little truck has a nice   auto   feature   which enables the car to switch power to whichever wheel needs it most   this essentially allows you to have wd on all the time   without the excess fuel consumption   there is   of course   also the option of putting it in full time wd   presumably better for snowy or slippery conditions   overall   the car feels quite stable   i always feel like it is   in control   with no fear of swaying or tipping   it feels like a quality ride b synposis   i am quite happy with my new little escape   i will gingerly classify it as a   luxury   suv   because in the limited model   it has the finest equipment one could want in a utility vehicle   it has a nice upscale feel to it   and it drives quite nicely   forming a near perfect hybrid of car and truck   i think it makes a nice alternative to both the unimaginative mini van and the fuel guzzling true trucks or suv   it may just make a perfect match for someone who needs extra space for children and accompanying accessories   but who does not want to give up owning a luxury car b post note b while this review is on a   escape   for some reason epinions did not offer   as an option in the   model year   drop down window   fear not   it is not a review of a   car  
1288,1,  yes indeed   this   compact   suv is a gentle ride with superb   responsive handling   braking is smooth and crisp and the   inch wheels are very nice   the exterior looks are clean   sporty and have a touch of elegance   especially with the   tone grey lower body moulding   the mach stereo is quite bold and the   cd changer is handy to have   saves me from fishing around in the center console for another disc   the   tone leather seating is elegant and upscale   the storage pods are plenty and the leg room for driver and passenger belies its size   the sun roof is easy to operate and an option with every penny when you can smell the sweet breeze initially i wasn t wild about the color of my escape   red   but it s really more of a rich ruby and i ve received a ton of compliments on the hue mostly though i appreciate the safety factors such as the front and side air bags and the abs braking capabilities on the down side   as i glance over my left shoulder in preparation for a lane change   the visual is not clear   and folding down the rear seats is more complicated than it should be   the gear shift lever is too long and sometimes gets in the way of the nicely placed instrument panel   the fabled   wind noise   problem is corrected for me by rolling up windows folks   i m a long time gmc   jimmy   owner and i was skeptical of a product   believe me   my initial resistance has been replaced by cheerleading for this frisky   sporty   sophisticated suv   additionally   almost all of the sites i visited through various search engines raved about the escape   more importantly   owners of escapes did too i can recommend the   escape xlt premium without qualification   you ll be so happy with this vehicle  
1289,1,  i bought this truck new   had   miles on it   that s new in my book   about   weeks ago   although i have only had it for a short time   i find the ride very enjoyable   on the highway as well as through town   through town the ride is a little bumpy   but it   quot is quot   a pickup truck   considering its center of gravity is a little higher than the standard models   because of the   tires   it corners fairly well for a pickup truck the   l v provides plenty of power   decent acceleration as well as a good amount of torque   i get about   miles to the gallon on the highway   that s traveling between   and   mph   it also has good mid level acceleration   from   to   mph   the truck boasts a top speed of about mph   the   gear automatic transmission s shifting is almost unnoticeable even under heavy acceleration   it is also equipped with an overdrive switch to limit the transmission to the   base gears for those up and down back road trips we all love so much   the cast aluminum deep dish wheels look very sharp on this truck   another nice feature is the vacuum lock x switching   which allows the truck to be switched from w high to w high and back to w high at almost any speed   the interior of the truck is well laid out   the    split front seat is quite comfortable   and the center fold up arm rest tape holder cd holder change holder is also a very nice feature   although the cab is pretty roomy   it is hard for me to imagine   grown adults being able to sit on the tiny fold down seats provided in the extended cab   the space within the extended portion of the cab is made super accessible by the two fold out doors on either side   these doors are very well hidden   so well hidden in fact it took me   days to realize my new truck was actually a   door   there is plenty of room for a great deal of cargo back there   and loading and unloading is a snap my advice for someone thinking of purchasing one of these trucks   is to go with the extended cab x with the   l v   i have heard from many that the   l v and the   l   are both under powered for this truck    besides bigger is usually better   once i have had this truck a little longer and have more info about the reliability i will write some more reviews on it   i am also planning on making some modifications on this truck which i will also share with you all br br  
1290,1,  first let me say that as a rock star   i object to the stereotypical view of people who own pickup trucks as rednecks   i am on the cutting edge of music and fashion   and i ve never owned a pair of boots in my life   that said   i must tell you that the   extended cab is the perfect vehicle for a young musician such as myself   the bed is plenty big enough for all of my band s equipment   there s more than enough power to haul it all around the southeastern us   the cab is quite roomy   and the four door option makes it easy to lure   year old girls into it   the stereo is great   mine came with cassette and cd players   the outside appearance is sport enough to say   hey   i ve got style   but humble enough to not attract too much attention   i got the step side model   which i think looks really cool   almost as sexy as me living in an urban area   you d think i d have trouble parking a x pickup   not so   even though it s big enough to haul anything i could put in it   it s small enough to park anywhere i ve recomended this truck to all of my friends   three of them took my recomendation and are now as happy as i am with it  
1291,1,  i d only driven chevy products until recently   i considered myself a die hard chevy person   then my mom got a new supercab   i went to new york to visit her and wound up   having   to drive her truck while i was there   i mean she really had to twist my arm i was pretty astounded   i d never thought myself to be a truck girl   but i fell in love with this   it s a   cherry red   fully loaded with cd player   electric everything   etc   the ride is incredibly smooth   and it has all the comforts of home if you re looking for a manly truck   this isn t for you   it s definitely more accomodating   with easy to use features and lots of gadgets   the supercab is helpful as well   as my mother has   children still at home   she drove from illinois to new york with   adults and   children   all of their   quot stuff quot   and my new living room set with no problems   no cramping   etc   plus   it s still stylish and fun to drive i took it off roading on the back roads in upstate new york   and it has quite of bit of pick up and go   with all of it s power and superior handling   i still wasn t overwhelmed   i m    quot   and weigh   lbs on a good day   so needless to say   i m used to driving really little cars   chevy cavalier   so i thought i d freak out having to drive a truck not at all i highly recommend this truck for anyone who wants a fun   handy little truck br br  
1292,1,  i recommend this vehicle for it s safety as well as it s comfort   my husband and i liked it so much after we traded it the first time we went back to and got the same truck back   the only downfall on this truck is that if you have more than one child who is ultimately going to grow up quicker than you can imagine then you will need to get the king cab   i have two children and as they grow older it is getting a bit crowded in the truck   other than that it is a wonderful truck   it stands up much better than the other models as far as breakdowns and best built   a few months ago i backed into a   which my husband wasn t very thrilled with   but the never even got a scratch on it   the on the other hand was so weakly built that it just dented immediately   even my insurance agent was shocked   not a scrap on it   so if you re looking for reliable and durable the f xl is the way to go br br  
1293,1,  ok   a little background on myself   i ve owned two toyota wd pickups   one was an extracab   one wasn t   i ve owned full size gmcs and fords   and i ve driven just about all of the small pick up class brands   second   let me give my disclaimer   having owned a few pick ups in my life and knowing the loyalties that come with pick up ownership   i am not about to force my preference on anyone   however   i can honestly say that without any hesitation that i have never been happier with the truck i am driving today   i bought my   in march of    the dealership was the last place i went   only after combing the toyota   nissan   and chevy lots   nissan went out the window after about ten minutes   despite the weird looks of their entry into the smaller truck market   the salesman had the ability to annoy me right off the lot   quot that excite   cha    quot hey   buddy that excite   cha quot whatever   nissan   anyway   toyota almost had me   i ve been a fan of toyotas for awhile and would still recommend them to anyone that had the money and didn t mind having to buy a new truck every few years   that s my only gripe about toyota   they just seem to give way and start to feel a little shaky after a few years of semi hard driving   i d hate to see how they fare in real difficult terrain   another minus   the paper thin doors   as far as chevy goes   close but not quite   chevy seems to have a decent product   but i think that if you are going to go for a chevy   make it a full size   one thing i ve never really liked about chevy is that they have never impressed me as a   working   truck   they always seemed too   street   for me   on to   despite having had on of the closest to pleasant experiences i ve ever had at a dealership   the just worked for me   solid doors and tailgate   the windows closed tightly   and the engine and transmission worked   and still work   like they should   i purchased the    v   and so far have had no problems   semi frequent obstacles have required me to utilize the shift on the fly wd   which has worked like a charm   only once   on the beach   has it felt a little squirrely   but we survived intact   i still believe that a truck is a truck   and you are never going to get loyalists to change their views on which is best   i m glad i did   though   i guess my ultimate advice is this   if you want to buy a truck   go to every brand dealer and drive them all   full size and smaller versions   that s what i did   and it put me in the seat of the   and firmly planted in my mind that my next truck will be a   too br br  
1294,1,  i m currently leasing a brand new   truck   it s a   wheel drive with a v   engine   it rides pretty smooth and it came with all the accessories and i do mean all   i love the cd player   this is my first truck and it wasn t my first choice   money was a factor since i still owed on my other car and trucks depreciate less i ve been told   all in all i like it   besides the accessories   i like the fact that i sit high up and the   wheel drive will come in handy in the snow   i live in minnesota   it also has a step on the side to get up into the the pick up area if you are carrying something in back   it would be great for moving big furniture   i find it hard to get back into the extended cab area   however   to store things   i miss my trunk   also   it doesn t get good gas mileage and i drive a lot for my job   there s also this annoying sound when you don t buckle your seat belt right away   it will ding about ten times very fast and if you still don t put your seat belt on it will continue to do this every minute   o k   already   anyway   so far   it has turned out to be a nice little truck for me br br  
1295,1,  i bought my   taurus l wagon from a local used car lot in really good condition   it said   xxx on the five digit odometer so there was no telling how many miles was on it   i needed to have a car   and i always admired the taurus wagons   i took it on a test drive   and fell in love with the handling and with some of the features   i purchased the car for     doing a   buy here   pay here   financing   which i later paid it off early and only paid     for it   i took a trip the same day about   miles away from my home   on my way i ended up getting a speeding ticket for mph in a mph   i was actually so impressed with the handling and quality of ride   i was unaware that i was speeding   i was just watching the road   i made that trip   and back   and an extra couple of days on that full tank of gas   which impressed me for being a wagon   after a while i started noticing the   flaws   in it   i started having problems with the transmission   it started lacking horsepower   and the ac started getting warm   the rear wiper and rear defroster stopped working   i ended up re charging the ac retrofitted   and replacing the thermostat   water pump   radiator   the original one cracked and exploded   could have caused serious injury   both front mounts   and a battery   though we replaced a lot of stuff   we live in the mountains in nc and put about    miles a year on it   and i was very impressed with how this   year old car took the stresses of everyday climbing hills and pulling a lot of weight with its front wheel drive   i sold this wagon to get a   oldsmobile custom cruiser   check out that review later  
1296,1,  i recently had to rent a car after a snowy truck accident   so they gave me a focus from enterprise exterior the new   edge   styling looks pretty cool   it s modern and attractive for a car in my opinion   the wheelbase is a little longer than a comparable honda civic interior the dashboard is clean and functional   the instrument panel also has that new   modern   look and feel to it   the stereo and a c settings are pretty easy to use   and the buttons are well defined and easy to access the stereo reception isn t the greatest and the system is sub par overall the seats are pretty comfortable but lacks in lumbar support and armrest   i still found it to be fairly comfortable for everyday driving driving experience it surprisingly handled pretty well for a car in its class   very european like feel   however   the steering wheel tended to vibrate a lot over rough pavement   and be prepared for a noisy ride the ride is actually pretty comfortable   i was pleasantly surprised   it s a bit on the firm side   and you still feel all the road s irregularities   but it s a lot better than most cars in its class the one thing that did bother me a bit was the amount of road engine noise   i ve heard that a comparable hyundai elantra does an excellent job of keeping the road engine noise down   and that car costs less than a comparable focus   something for the engineers to shoot for   this is a great value and its great fun to drive my only complaints are the noise and the always vibrating steering wheel it would have got a   star if it wasn t for that annoying vibrating steering wheel   trust me   it vibrates like crazy  
1297,1,  i bought my aerostar van brand new in    i still drive and enjoy my van to this very day   every time i think about trading it in for a newer vehicle i can t think of anything i would rather have to drive   i bought the extended version of the aerostar because i wanted and needed the extra space   i can get all my groceries in the back   the kids toys and necessities when traveling to grandma s house   and when going on a long trip suitcases and everything the kids   quot have to bring quot   along fit nicely in the extend space   i just don t understand how people who have regular mini vans fit everything in when going on vacations   i can t imagine what the passenger area looks like   the extend area of the aerostar allows for comfortable and less crowded seating when hauling items   the seats are removable allowing for even more room for hauling large items   we have carried lumber   furniture   mattresses   and even key stones in the back of our aerostar van   it is almost like having a truck and van in one   the seats are not easily removed and it can be necessary to have help in taking them out my aerostar is currently   years old and all i have ever really had to replace is regular wear and tear items   i ve only had to replace the brakes twice and it is on it s second set of tires   one thing i don t like about the aerostar is that when the brakes get wet   and you go to use them   they are extremely touchy   they are so touchy that everyone is jerked forward when you touch the brakes   usually this only happens during the first couple of times of using them until they dry out it is for these reasons that i still haven t had the desire to trade my old aerostar van in for a newer and fancier van   i value the extended part of the van too much to get a newer one that doesn t offer the extra room in the back   i could care less about dual side opening doors   remote door openers   or less mileage just give me more rear space and i m a happy camper br br  
1298,1,   please notice this is a review for a   escort zx   not a standard escort just recently early this year   i have the opportunity to purchase this fine automobile they call an escort zx   i previously owned a geo tracker which went completely belly up on me for the fourth time   grrr   and thought it was time for a new change   also being that i desperately needed a car for spring break   and fast   i didn t waste any time to go to the town car dealership and i checked out their used car lot   they had plenty of cars there   but i had my eye on one car in particular and that was the zx i was able to purchase this car remarkably for     i have been a proud owner ever since   and i have had all kinds of crazy ideas on what to do to it next   hopefully   eventually   i plan on putting a subtle body kit that will bring the lines of the car out a little more   this car is an extremely under rated car   it drives me nuts that magazines don t talk about them much   if at all   i mean   for some reason   wanted to replace this car with the focus zx which   don t get me wrong   is a great car   but so is the zx   well   enough about how i feel   on with the review b looks b overall   the zx offers a very tasteful   sporty lines that are a step up from its escort coupe counterpart   honestly   i prefer   the zx over the escort coupe one reason only   it looks a heck of a lot better   i mean   when you drive   you want something that will turn heads   the zx hopefully will do that   also   if the factory setup isn t everything that you were looking for in a zx   there are plenty of body kits available for this model   knowing where to look is the hard part   magazines tend to leave out this fine automobile and look past its potential in becoming an excellent custom   wings west offers an excellent   subtle body kit that is if you have the money   this body kit   as well as many others   don t come cheap b drivetrain b the escort zx is powered by the    liter    valve   dual overhead cam zetec engine which pumps out   horsepower stock   this car is available with a   speed manual transmission   or a   speed automatic   this car has an incredible amount of acceleration   the only disappointing fact is that put a governor at   mph on all zx models except the s r models   which has an improved cam timing   and a speedo cluster that goes up to   mph instead of   mph like the other models   also   the s r has   horsepower   this car is a limited edition car that was offered in   and    but with a little bit of money   you can get the same performance out of your zx as you can out of the s r possibly   maybe more b interior b inside the zx   you will find that there is plenty of room in the front   and viewing is excellent from inside   the car has solar glass that tints slightly to the sun   the seats are very comfortable   and provide a very smooth ride   the back doesn t have as much leg room as one would anticipate   but the seats are very comfortable   the roof is slightly low in the back which makes it slightly difficult for taller people to sit in the back    handling b the car is a very responsive car   it will quite possibly turn on a dime   i don t know what else to say about it other than   it handles real good b braking b just like any car   brakes need to be serviced   i changed the brakes on my zx as soon as i purchased it   so far   i can t complain about the braking   except   i did experience the brakes locking up on me when turning off of a highway   it was rather scary   fortunately   no one was in front of me   or in the other lane   i would highly recommend getting abs brakes as an option if it doesn t come standard   i obviously don t have them after that little incident b safety b my   zx comes standard with driver and passenger second generation air bags   abs was an option back in    not sure if it still is now   but if it isn t   like i said before   it would be very beneficial if you do get that my zx is a    even though this is a review for a    the whole design of the car hasn t been altered between     maybe the only difference is that   escort   was dropped off the rear bumper   my zx hasn t failed me and i got mine used with   miles on it   i haven t had a problem with it yet and hopefully i won t for a long time   my zx has about every option offered for the   model   it has power windows   power moon roof   power mirrors   alloy wheels   rear spoiler    disc cd changer   memory driver seat   intermittent wipers   fog lights   did i forget anything   lol   this car is hot   they are very affordable   and very reliable   if you haven t driven a lately   maybe you should start with the zx   you will be hooked for life  
1299,1,  the first car i ever had was a   escort   and the first new car i bought was a   escort zx   the only similarity between the two vehicles is the name   and that s not a bad thing unlike the underpowered escort of old with the paper thin doors   the zx feels like a car that isn t at the bottom of the new car price level   but the fact is the zx is an affordable new car   i thinks it s the best car on the market for less than      in fact   it can be well below   grand if you can live without the spoiler and automatic transmission   it s more fun to drive with the manual transmission anyway after putting    miles on my zx without a trip to the mechanic   i have to say i m thrilled with the car   it seems to have all the power you really need   but it isn t a gas hog with just a four cylinder engine   one of my favorite parts of the design is the wide wheelbase   which allows for excellent handling   it doesn t corner like a bmw   but you don t pay what you would for a true sports car and if you like loud music while you drive   the optional premium sound package with the cd changer is worth the money in short   this is a fine car for anyone who wants a fun   reliable car that won t make their insurance go way up   one warning this is not the perfect car for those with young children   getting a car seat from the back would not be an easy chore br br  
1300,1,  why did i buy this vehicle   my previous car was having problems   i needed a reliable car because i commuted to a college   miles away   i went shopping for used cars   but the dealership in my hometown   in northern california   offered     financing on all   escorts to buyers with good credit   i test drove the car   liked it   and decided to buy it   with the     financing   i got a brand new car for the same price that i could have bought a   or   thousand dollar used car   a new car was perfect for me because i needed something reliable   i love driving a car that gets   miles to the gallon   seats for comfortably   and can keep up with the two seaters   having the efficiency of an economy car   the room of a family car   and a car that can climb the siskiyou mountains   very steep   in fifth gear leaves me completely pleased with this car   it may sound corny but i can honestly say that i do not have one complaint about this car   considering the low price i paid for it   approximately    and only     interest   when you test drive this vehicle   it will probably feel less swift than it actually is   this is because it is designed to be a commuter car   and it is unusually high geared   it is designed for the highway   not the speedway    you can feel the difference when driving a contour   who should buy this car     college students   reliability     commuters   great freeway car     families on a limited budget   has all the basic necessities of a quality car   at a price us poor folk can afford   who shouldn t buy this car     hot rodders   like i said before   this car is for the highway not the speedway br br  
1301,1,  the   escort zx was my first car purchase   i shopped around all of summer   and bought the escort in august   i bought it for three reasons   price   looks   and handling   price   i bought it for     with pretty much no features   radio   rear window defroster   i ve been following the used car market   and i ve noticed it s kept its value exceptionally well looks   i bought the denim blue model   i really love the sleek lines   and low slung look of this car   handling   this car drives like a dream   it accelerates quickly   hugs corners   and has lots of zip for a four cylinder engine if you are taller   i m    quot   you probably will feel cramped in this car   it is a perfect fit for me   i don t have to scoot the seat forward much to reach the pedals   which i do for most other vehicles   the fully loaded zx came with some pretty neat stuff   like cd   abs   moon roof   air conditioning   power door locks windows and remote keyless entry   i couldn t afford those extras   but it s nice to know i could have had them   the one noticeable lack was the absence of cruise control   for long trips the seats are comfy   the stereo is decent   but no cruise control is a drag   i highly recommend this car for commuters or for mostly in town driving   for long trips though   the gas mileage is great   it has quite a bit of trunk space for a coupe   and the back seats are pretty spacious     
1302,1,  my husband owns a   escort zx   he loves his little car   he always talks about it and talks of how people compliment him on the look of the car   at first we bought this car because of the low price   as we began to drive it more often we decided we liked it better than cars we ve owned in the past   the things i love about this car is the quick acceleration and sporty look   the gas mileage is good for a sports car   we usually get around   city   highway   the downfalls are the lack of head room and the loud running engine   it is nice to drive this vehicle around town because of how fast it will get up and go   it is easy to pass slow drivers and make that yellow light   i think this car would be best for the teenagers   thanks   
1303,1,  when i went out looking for a vehicle i had the price and how long the car would last in mind   price was comparable with other makes and models so i checked on the length of time it would last   people i had talked to who owned them had nothing but good things to say about the long lasting and body   that to me was a plus   it is comfortable unless you go on a very lengthy trip then the driver side seat tends to get uncomfortable   after driving the vehicle to work for quite sometime i found it was very good on gas   i drive an estimated   miles to work   days a week so on an average i drive   miles a week and fill my gas tank once   the car handles very well in the winter   i live close to the snow belt here in michigan so i need something dependable   the bigger vehicles just don t make me feel as safe as driving smaller vehicles   i feel as though i have more control over my actions and i have found this particularly comforting with this vehicle we have for the first snow falls this year parked a x truck we own and drove the escort solely since the truck was all over the road   the escort went without a problem the things i can say i tend to hate about the vehicle is that you can only have three beverages in the car with only three cup holders   that are also small and the two front ones are too close to the dash so only short cups will fit   sitting in the back seat is uncomfortable if you have a tall person sitting in front   the seats crack and creek when a heavier set person sits in front so i feel as though they aren t built as solidly overall i would say this is a very economical vehicle worth the money if you are looking for something mechanically well built   unfortunately for the taller and well built man this would not be the type vehicle to own   if you are a smoker sadly you must pay an extra charge for an ashtray the size of a tennis ball and only one per vehicle br br  
1304,1,  i bought the car because my dad bought the first escort back in   and i wanted to be like dad   i waited till there was an escort worthy of a by from me and i m not just bragging because i own one   it is one of the most reliable cars on the market i didn t just go out and buy it because it was a and i looked at the market and it really was the best in power and in gas mileage and in over all performance i would give this car an   out of   on looks and handing   well as for theft protecting i does have some flaws there mine was stolen twice from me in the state of tennessee and i was lucky to be able to say i have the car in my hands once more   mine is green in color and use to have five spoke   quot   rims but i have to replace them all i would recommend for every one to get steel rims for your escort br br  
1305,1,  i recently purchased a   escort station wagon   i can t tell you how much i love it   i drive almost   miles per day    days a week   that car just keeps going and going   i am getting roughly   miles to the gallon so i certainly can t complain about that the interior is comfortable   almost like a luxury car   there is plenty of room for all the people you want to bring along   the dog   cats   luggage   anything that you want to go with you   the maintenance on this car is virtually non existent   the tires are the kind where you can buy them most anywhere in stock and they are not that expensive i have ac   a really good stereo system   rear wiper and sprayer   keyless entry on the back and the drivers side door   of course it has roll down windows   but that is one less thing that can go wrong when you have the electric ones   the brakes are power which i prefer   not the abs which i can t seem to get used to when i drive my husband s car all in all   i am very pleased with this car   it has plenty of power   speeds along especially on the highway where i do most of my driving   it is a beautiful sable green color and is a very attractive wagon   also have a roof rack for any extras   i love this wagon   if you would be in the market for a wagon   check these out   i am just disappointed that they don t make these anymore  
1306,1,  this is my first new car and i was interested in getting the best car for the cheapest price   and that is what i got with the escort   the price was great   and i even got extras   automatic door lock   air conditioning   automatic transmission   were all included   the only problem with the climate control is the heat does not get really hot and it does take a long time to heat up   this occurs only in the severe cold   the air conditioner works immediately and gets really cold   the only other   quot problem quot   or disadvantage with this car is the pick up   i do not notice any problem until i am merging into heavy traffic and have to make a quick entrance onto the roadway it just doesn t happen   the engine revs   but i find myself pushing myself back and forth   in a futile attempt to get the car to perform faster   other than those   minor disadvantages   the car is wonderful   it is small enough to get in and out of places easily   yet does not compromise comfort    i suppose if you weighed over   lbs   there might be a problem   very smooth ride   and easy to handle   the back seats are split and either one can come down   or both   and give more trunk room   i notice of all my cars and i have had many this one has the most useable trunk space never have problems with my groceries   gas mileage is great   the only thing i have ever had done was oil changes and have had no mechanical problems   it is a great car   for a family of     kids and   adults fit with no   quot room quot   problems     
1307,1,  my escort is my first car   i purchased a because it was made in the united states and i wanted to feel like i was giving back to my community in some way   i also got a because products are good and reliable products for the most part   my parents had a type vehicle at one point when i was a child and i really liked that car   they also had a explorer when i got my escort   so has been a tradition in my family   my favorite feature is my sound system   i love music and the sound system is good   the bass and the treble sound great   it has enough clarity to play my tunes and keep me happy   i do waiver about whether i like the fact that the antenna has to be manually pulled up   but i mostly like the fact that it is manual at least it s something i don t have to worry about when i got through the car wash and for the most part i don t need it for the stations that i listen to on a regular basis   my escort has enough get up and go for me too   i have a   mile commute to work and school five days a week   but i don t seem to need to fill up the gas tank more than once a week for the most part   in cold weather   my car has performed up to the standards i think it should as well   overall i have no real complaints about my   escort   i was a little sad that they were discontinuing the escort in favor of the focus  
1308,1,  i was originally looking for a honda and willing to pay the extra thousands of dollars i saved when i purchased my escort zx starting college in sept i ll have enough expenses without spending a lot on a car   i didn t even know what a escort was and when i was looking for cars   it caught my eye   it s good on gas and has the power to get up and go   i wish it had a little more leg room in the back for passengers but as the driver i don t have any complaints   i drove a toyota camry prior to my escort and i don t feel any difference in the way it handles   i basically will use my car to commute to school anyone looking for a economical car should check out the zx   you ll be surprised it s a escort   excellent for moms with small children since it is a two door   being a two door it is a little difficult for larger people to get in and out of the back as any two door might be     
1309,1,  my   escort has almost    on it and i must tell you i have been very happy with my car   it is a four door   and the back seat is very roomy   my kids can have their friends go with us on trips   as   people can fit in the back seat   the front seats tilt back enough for roomy leg room   my six foot   son s head does not hit the roof   it is also very good on gas   a tank of gas can last me around   miles   i think it is very easy to drive and compact enough to find a good parking spot   the trunk is spacious   also   we camp a lot and i can fit in the trunk all the gear we need for a weekend   including tent   sleeping bags   firewood and cooler   i plan to pass this car along to my youngest when he turns    i m sure it will run as well for him as it has for me br br  
1310,1,  i am the second owner of a cute little   red tempo   my tempo ha    miles on it and it is still running like a top   i payed     for it and so far it had been worth every single penny   my parents own a   tempo and they will tell you the same thing the tempo is a great   reliable car   but back to my car   tempos are great cars for the kind of conditions i have to endure   in the summer it is blazing hot   but the tempo is fully equiped for that   the   model has a newer ac unit in it that always keeps the car comfortable   in the winter i have to contend with lots and lots of snow   the tempo is great for that because of it awsome front wheel drive and its ability to start in sub zero weather   the previous owner of my tempo was a college student like my self   she took excelent care of the car and it shows   my car has verry little rust   and the only matenence done on it so far is the    mile tune up and regular oil changes   the only disadvantages to the tempo are it seats   it ability for top speed   and it breaks   the seats are very likely to make your back sore if you are driving for more than an hour straight   the tempos top speed is about   miles per hour so freeway driving kind of sucks   and the break roters have to be switched quite often   other than that the temo is a great affordable car     
1311,1,  we bought a big   beat up truck so that no one   ever again   drove into me in my little car   it worked   this is the best car i have ever owned b why we bought this car   when we moved to ny from south africa in   we bought a small   zippy hyundai accent   in the first three months of driving   six   people literally just drove into us   either they didn t see my little car   or they thought they were bigger so didn t care whether i got out of the way   since i was driving with my little son in the car we decided to buy the   biggest   thing we could afford   which turned out to be a   bronco xlt   it has a bull bar on the front   a tow bar on the back and metal steps on both sides   it is rusty and dented   and since we got it i don t think i have been cut off in the traffic once b driving and maintenance   on the sensible side   we get a tune up once a year   and the engine runs like a dream   it feels safe and solid up to about mph   but i try to be a little careful about cornering   it accelerates like the wind   i had to replace the alternator   but otherwise i haven t had any breakdowns in   years   lots of small   irritating things have had to be fixed   like the door hinges   the doors wouldn t stay open   the wiring for the back power window and a side window   and the interior light   that s just because it s old   i guess   generally all the repairs have been really cheap   we replaced part of the exhaust on the hyundai   just the part was over     the same piece on the bronco was    i strongly believe that in any accident my family will be better off in this car than just about any other   particularly in our price range   all in all this truck is a joy to drive   and i must admit i rather like the image too   br br  
1312,1,  i love my bronco   i think it has been the best running vehicle i have ever owned   i bought it because it was such a good deal   that i just couldn t pass it up   i ve wanted one because they looked roomy   one day i was out running around and saw it   at such a low price   i just had to have it   so i took it out for a test drive and it handled so well i took it to have my dad look at it   he went with me driving around   we took it back to the lot and filled out the paper work   i got to take it that night   i drove around for hours   i knew i that i didn t go wrong   i just love to go driving around because it runs like a dream   is real smooth   i like this vehicle so much   if i was to win the lottery   my whole family would own one   if you want to enjoy your ride to the store or just anywhere this is the vehicle for you   there is plenty of space to put a stroller   groceries   and the kids too   people who can t judge distance of your cars should not own this vehicle   because you are pretty high up and the front looks pretty wide   if you ask me   you should own one br br  
1313,1,  our small business needed a cargo van a year ago and you can t really buy a cargo van without at least considering the econoline   the big three all make cargo vans that are comparable in size   cargo capacity and price   we researched   measured and drove each van for at least   days before we made the choice to buy the we found the to be the easiest to drive and the best equipped for the price no matter what engine you choose   the chevy express cargo van was a good second choice but was a little more expensive and the financing offered by gmac at the time was inferior   the van frankly hasn t changed a lot since the   s and it shows in every aspect we ended up with the e    ton model with the v   engine   this engine is rated at   horsepower and can pull the van reasonably well unless you load it full of tools or heavy equipment   users who will push the limits of the van s cargo capacity will not like the v    the only advantage of the v   is the lower acquisition cost   the   l v   makes more power and gets better gas mileage   not to mention better resale value if you sell the van before it is a box of rust we have had no mechanical troubles at all and have put    miles on it to date   there are a lot of these vans on the road today with over    miles on them   if we had to do it again we would get the v    otherwise you really can not go wrong with this van as a great work vehicle     
1314,1,  are you looking for a work van    econoline is the way to go   i haven t owned anything beside a van   my last van was a gray econoline    with proper care it lasted me ten years   i bought another van this year   i was contemplating on whether i should try another van   i couldn t even think of another van that would have what i needed   my vans usually go through a lot of wear and tear   i drive around all day from place to place   it is not the most comfortable vehicle though and it can only hold   passengers   if you are looking for something to be comfortable   this is not the way to go   it is comfortable for many work vans that i have been in   i would choose a car to drive around in if i didn t have to carry all of my equipment   it is a very economical and durable vehicle     
1315,1,   needs b after three years of driving my   college car   a geo metro   and heady with a summer s worth of paychecks   aka   more money than i d ever seen   i was in the market for an suv   i d spent the last three years hydroplaning all over arkansas   highways   i wanted something big   heavy   and solid to drive   i also wanted more power than my little three cylinder i eventually settled on a   explorer    i started shopping around thinking i wanted all the bells and whistles   namely four wheel drive   i   wisely   ended up with a two wheel drive   explorer sport    the two door   sport   is about a foot shorter than the four door model and seemed huge enough after my metro   i was also living in texas and really couldn t justify four wheel drive i m not the off roading type and when texas gets bad weather   everything completely shuts down anyway   snow and ice holidays yea b gas mileage b let me get this category out of the way   yes   my suv is a gas hog   my   explorer   does have a standard transmission which gets slightly better gas mileage than an automatic   what irks me about all the condemnation of suvs for sucking down large amounts of gasoline is that mini vans are just as bad in this respect or any other vehicle with a six or eight cylinder engine   while suvs are   status symbols   mini vans are   family vehicles   and trucks are   quot work vehicles quot   but   i digress b features b i anti lock brakes i   not only has the abs on my   explorer    saved me from injury   it also saved me from rear ending a military police car as my   explorer   slid approximately fifteen feet down an icy incline at a stop sign at fort leavenworth   kansas   in january   the abs kicked in almost immediately and i was able to stop the vehicle a few inches short of the police car   i also honked the horn to warn the mp that i was on a collision path with his vehicle but he didn t have enough time to react i visors i   i m rather short   especially when seated   so no visor is perfect or long enough for me   what i like about the   explorer s   visors are that there are two   one to flip over to the side   and another to flip down in front so that the driver and front seat passenger aren t moving one visor back and forth on a curvy road   yes   this is a little thing   but the great thing about my   explorer   are all the details   like an attached gas cap   that add up to comfort and convenience i cargo area i   very roomy   the back seats also fold down   the cargo capacity is by far the most useful feature of this vehicle   i move   on average   every twelve months   and with the cargo capacity   i can take a good chunk of things i ll need right away in my new home   as well as pets   plants   and all the things the movers won t touch like cleaning supplies   batteries   alcohol   because i have an suv   the army will reimburse me a few hundred dollars for moving up to six hundred pounds of my own stuff that i would take with me anyway   i ve crammed about seven hundred pounds in the cargo area and my bike on the luggage rack on top and could still see out the back window   whenever i buy a piece of furniture   no problem   load it up   note   as a safety precaution   if you can t close the cargo door completely   drive with the windows down so that any exhaust fumes that may come in aren t overpowering i cruise control i   once you have it   you can t go without it again   i ve driven across the country with and without cruise control   and i prefer having it   the troublesome sciatic nerve in my right thigh also prefers it b handling b i stability i   excellent   yes   i know all the current furor over the   explorer s   stability   i ve found my   explorer   as stable or more stable than other suvs and high center of gravity vehicles   including the toyota pickup upon which i learned to drive a standard transmission   i also don t drive like a maniac or a race car driver   the handling on higher vehicles is different than cars acknowledge this from the outset and drive accordingly   as a petite woman   being up high is an advantage for me   i can see the entire road and feel safer and more aware   i recommend that short people get the step   i don t have one and it s not a problem normally   but getting in the seat can be somewhat tricky when i m wearing a mini skirt i turning radius i   excellent   the   explorer sport   has an exceedingly tight turning radius for a vehicle its size   i ve driven the four door   explorer   and the turning radius isn t as great   i easily swing into slanted parking spaces from the opposite direction or make u turns without hitting curbs b repairs and maintenance b i ve owned my   explorer   for six years and other than the   tires    the extent of my repairs and maintenance are as follows   regular oil changes   about every     miles   a new air filter last summer   adjusted brakes this fall at    miles   some new belts   also at    miles   when the original ones began to dry rot   new windshield wipers a couple years ago   and i had to use epoxy to glue the gear shift knob back on when it came loose   all the repairs were recommended to me as preventive measures when i took the vehicle in for regular maintenance   i ve never taken my   explorer   in for   quot problems quot all of the owner operator maintenance parts of the engine   like the oil wand and the opening for adding more windshield wiper fluid   are clearly marked in yellow for dummies like me who don t really know what they re looking for underneath the hood my   explorer s   rear driver side was dented in a hit and run accident when the vehicle was parked   causing    in damages   promptly fixed   one of the tires exploded   my parents were driving so i don t know the details   and caused another    in damage to the same area   grrr firestones   again promptly fixed   i can t tell any difference from when the vehicle was brand new   i also had another firestone tire   front   driver s side   disintegrate while i was driving mph on the highway   i maintained control of the vehicle and came to a stop on the side of the road   other than the tire   my   explorer   suffered no damage whatsoever and handled well throughout the incident    and now i have five brand new firestones i have the extended seven year warranty and haven t used it once   definitely a waste of money and completely unnecessary for this vehicle b cost b the sale price of my    explorer sport    purchased in september    was      bargained down from      sticker price   i probably could have gone lower   but i had the financial wherewithal to pay off my loan in    years   i m pretty satisfied   especially given that my insurance premiums did not increase significantly from my metro   and i haven t had to shell out outrageous amounts for maintenance and repairs b conclusion b my    explorer   was a good buy and i am loathe to give it up   however   my needs have changed i m moving to a climate that requires four or all wheel drive and i plan to start a family in a few years so a four door model is in order   will i buy another   explorer    i m still researching   but i ve narrowed the field to the   all wheel drive   four door   explorer   and the   four wheel drive   four door   nissan pathfinder    i ll let you know in about six months or so   happy driving br br  
1316,1,  i bought an    crown victoria for less than one thousand dollars and it never ceases to amaze me   it s got a v   a   liter engine   and over one hundred and fifty horse power   this car might be old but it can definitely kick some but   it has a great pick up i have ran into a couple of problems with this car including   windows not working   alternator not working   a c not cold enough   and some little minor problems   but the car is   years old and it is bound to have some problems   i have had the car for about   years now and i have only brought it into the shop twice   most of the problems that occur with this car are minor things that can be fixed without taking it to the shop   i love this car   it is a tank   i don t have to worry about dying in a car wreck in this car   you could probably run into a brick wall at   miles per hour and still walk away   it isn t hard at all to park   and it has a great suspension system   the speakers weren t too good though so i got them replaced   ad i put in a cd player   other than that everything about my   vic is cool   i love this car   i am going to keep it until i die or until it quits on me   i don t know which will come first it has tons of space also   good for long distances br br  
1317,1,  i had gotten the bug to buy a used police car so i could yank the and other heavy duty items out of it for a chevy project car i attended a texas dps   state police   auction to see what i could get   when they started auctioning off the chevy caprice s at     for cars with    to    miles   i knew the prices were way out of line   anybody ever seen a used cop car   carpets all ripped   stains   loose wiring bundles etc   and set my sights on a lower priced vehicle   they finally brought out the crown vic s   which were all from a different agency   and the prices became more reasonable   i figured i could always adapt the to my car if need be it had actually been used by the alcoholic beverage commission in brownsville and el paso   the back seat looked like it had never been sat in   it was that clean   trunk was so clean it looked like it had never been used   when i went to review the maintenance records after purchase   i found out that these cars had originally been ordered with   s   per vin    but had actually come with w with certified calibration speedometer   woohoo   anybody wanting a cop car knows what this means   even if you don t know it s a cop car   this is usually a dead giveaway and means all heavy duty components from the factory what i have found with this car mileage   sucks   really   i usually drive around mph on the highway and i can watch the gas gauge drop    tank over the course of about   miles braking   haven t quite experienced brake fade but it is easy to think you re braking when you really aren t and have to squeeze harder on the pedal before rear ending someone power   initial acceleration sucks   but once it is up to speed and in the power band   you can barely tap the gas and it will accelerate quickly   and once it is going and you take your foot off the gas   it will continue to coast and barely slow down as noted by some other reviewers   i am having electric window problems   one doesn t work at all and another is slipping while going up   requiring me to manually push it up   but this isn t a big deal since i am the only who rides in this vehicle at this point   rather than yank the for my project car   i ve decided to strip the body off and use it as a base for a kitcar   like a shelby cobra or something  
1318,1,  i know this probably seems strange that i am writing this opinion instead of my husband but i love this truck   when i was   months pregnant with our second child my husband decided that we need a family car   i know this does not seem like a family car but it is used as our family car and i would not have it any other way   why did we choose the f supercab   first i have to say that my husband choose this vehicle   it would not had been my first choice   my first choice was the explorer   in the long run i am glad that my husband did not listen to me   i love driving this truck   it is so easy to drive   one of the main reasons we chose this truck is because my husband needed a large to pull his ft wellcraft open fisherman four hours away from our home   that is a lot of wear and tear on a vehicle   the second reason my husband chose the f is the size of it   it has a big bed for transporting items   as you already know if you have children   especially infants   that they require a lot of extra equipment when traveling   this was perfect   we could stuff all of the items in the back of the truck   so you are probably wondering what did we do when it rained   no we do not have top to it   we simply put tarps over the items we kept in the back   this seemed to do the trick why do i like the f   i will admit at first i didn t like the truck   it did take some getting use to   first   it was really big and bulky   i can remember trying to park at the local store in town   i think all of the other people knew when i was coming because the parking lots were empty except for a few cars   here i am in my big white f trying to park   can you only imagine   i know if my husband saw me during those first few months he would had probably banned me from driving the truck   so what did i do   until i felt comfortable with parking next to cars and other trucks i would pick a parking space as far away as possible so i would not hit anyone   okay men   you can laugh   let s get serious about why i like the f supercab   it is easy to drive   i like being up high where i can see everything while driving   if you are short like i am this is a nice feature   it gets decent gas mileage for a large engine   i believe it has a v or v in it   we get about   mpg in the city and   mpg on the interstate   i feel safe in the big truck   we have actually tested out how safe our truck   my husband does a lot of hunting and you can only imagine what our first wreck was   while driving out in the country near my husband s hunting grounds a deer jumped in the window   yes   you read that right   unbelievable the truck only received a major blow to the passenger door and front window   we even drove the vehicle home that night   so i feel safe about   of course we had those unmentionable firestone tires   don t get me started on it   if you would like to read my review on firestone tires just look for firestone almost killed my family by davelaura   that will give you some idea how i view the tires that uses on their vehicles   i don t approve of them   how do i feel when i drive my f   no   i don t feel like a redneck   i feel like myself   i love driving this truck and would not drive any other vehicle except maybe a mercedes but i know that will never happen   does the truck drive smooth on the open road   we do a lot of traveling and it is one of the smoothest vehicles i have been in   i used to drive a volvo   and i would say this truck is almost has smooth as the car   maybe i am pushing the truck a little too much   are the seats comfortable   i will admit after four hours in the truck i do get a little cranky but who wouldn t after that long of a drive   overall the truck is really comfortable and very roomy   i am sorry men if this doesn t help you but maybe it will help convince your wives why you need a truck   i was about to kill my husband when he purchased the truck   now i love him for it     
1319,1,  i bought my f just over a year ago and i have had plenty of time to formulate an opinion      i decided to buy a full size pickup since i was in the military and figured i would be moving a lot   i had been looking at the f   and the    both in the same price feature zone   here is what i discovered the has features that make it better suited for the individual who will be travelling mainly highway or town miles for several reasons   first off   the fact that it has the best gas mileage of any truck in its class helps   and i have the big v too   when you fill up a   gallon tank   that extra   miles per gallon helps believe it or not   secondly   the acceleration on the was outstanding   it was not sluggish at all which helps for changing lanes in heavy traffic   the anti lock breaks also offer better braking response than the   i have no complaints with payload either   i have an atv that i drive right up into the bed   close the tailgate   and go on my way   with my weight and the atv that is a total of about    pounds on the tailgate   and it takes it just fine without a single stress mark   don t really even notice a difference in acceleration with the extra weight    be careful on the turns though or you might lose your load   if you want to add a topper   the has a locking tailgate so you can secure the bed without having to buy extra equipment price will vary from dealer to dealer as you all know   but overall   the dealers were more willing to drop their price to stay competitive than the dealers i dealt with   using the site edmunds i found the dealer invoice price so i knew how far they could really go   surprisingly   the dealer i bought from went    below their invoice to sell me a truck   now grant it   it was near the end of the year clearance time   but they still beat the by over    there are some drawbacks though if you like loud music   like me   the stock stereo speakers deck are less than desirable   no problem right   get some new speakers   problem is   without some severe custom work   you can t even buy different speakers   that can be very costly if you don t know how to do it yourself another sore point is the back seat   the only has a   door extended cab   has   doors   and the back seat has about   inches less leg room than the   because of the way the back seat folds down in the   it makes installing subs or additional speakers almost impossible the also does not offer any kind of convenience console like digital compass and temperature gauge   the does   no big deal   but here fyi another piece of advice   that i wish i had adhered to   if you live in a climate that might get snow      spend the extra cash on   wheel drive   i already regret not having it   rear wheel drive only   even with weight in the bed   is darn near impossible to get up a snowy icy hill   i saw   or so pickups in the ditch this past winter   with little   cylinder front wheel drive cars passing them like nothing if you are an urban cowboy   the is a great choice   if you want to do a lot of farm work or off roading   i would have to go with the or a larger   f   or f    the handles more like a big car   and when you are behind the wheel of a   you know you are driving a truck br br  
1320,1,  this truck is an adventure every time that i step into it   first of all this is by far the larges vehicle that i ve been into   the triton v engine is so powerful i feel as if i could take on any other car or truck in a race   outside if you like trucks   it s one of the most beautiful trucks i ve ever seen   the front foot room is large and would be big enough for a large sized man   in the back there is enough room for children or smaller adults   overall this car is a great experience   the only disadvantage is parking this mammoth beast   despite this fact i would recommend this car to anyone br br  
1321,1,  if you are someone who loves trucks but feel comfortable in a car as well   this is the truck for you   the f   series has it all   they are very comfortable inside with features from basic vinyl and a radio to an extra port for utilities like a cell phone or a cd   speaker stereo   the ride is like being in a car instead of a truck because the suspension absorbs much of the bumps in the road   at the same time it can haul a truck load of rock and sand and still deliver control and smoothness the not so desirable features are that the side view mirrors are attached via plastic so they feel as though they are wearing out when you adjust the mirrors   also   the standard and upgrade tires are a bit small for the muscular look of the body   still   they do offer some nice alloy rims and good   long lasting tires wether you are a mom   a single person   a business person   an outdoor person   construction worker   or a lover of trucks   you will be very pleased when you drive an f    you will want to recommend it to your friends and family   take it from me   i have been in the landscape construction business for many years   this is the one   baby br br  
1322,1,  after driving a car for the past   years   i decided to buy a truck   i investigated the ram   chevy    gmc   and the f the ram looked pretty good to me   but after a test drive i felt the truck was put together rather cheaply   plus the dealers were rude and didn t know too much about the truck at all the gm products also looked pretty good   for some reason they wanted more money for a truck that didn t stand up to the f the f is good looking   build to last   and it was affordable   the only thing that i wish i had done was to get the x   but   that was another       never owning a truck before i felt the x was a good enough start in trucks i bought the v   it has more then enough horse power   it sits up tall and i feel level with many of the xs   it feels great looking above all the cars on the road   i can see traffic problems much sooner then any car on the road the only problem that i have had is getting use to the rear wheel drive and the rather light rear end of a truck   didn t hit anything   just some close calls   but   that would have happened with any truck i ve had the truck for about a year and    now   and i love driving the truck over any car br br  
1323,1,  i have had my   f   from the moment it hit the lot   since then i have put over   thousand miles on it   i have traveled all over the country   but primarily from south texas to canada   through the rocky mountains   colorado   wyoming   etc   driven in all possible weather conditions   i have changed the oil   and performed service checks every time it comes around   i was concerned with the new transmissions that were placed in this truck   but have seen no problems yet   did a great job improving and modifying the   transmissions   not once have i had a problem   a few weeks ago   i took apart the engine to check the wear   and there was little or none to be seen   i am greatly impressed with this truck   it is very stylish and had no defects   the paint is holding up greatly   unlike the   s aerostars that came out   it has maintained its smooth ride   and still out performs most chevys and dodges   unmodified   i have noticed no decline in performance over the years   acceleration has always been great   stereo sound is not that bad   considering it is factory   with the way my truck is running   i am sure it will last at least     miles  
1324,1,  my husband comes from a family   the only make of vehicle that they will buy is   the majority of the cars we have owned are also fords   stands for stability and durability the taurus is a wonderful family car with plenty of leg room   the comfort for long trips is outstanding   comfort should be the taurus   middle name   the trunk space is more than large enough for luggage or groceries the car drives like a dream and is easy to steer   it provides a very smooth ride for short and long trips   as a mother of small children   i love that you can lock the windows and doors at the driver s side   the doors are easily locked and unlocked from the outside as well   with only   turn the driver s side door is unlocked   with   turns all doors are unlocked   i think this is a nice safety feature the car would make a wonderful car for anyone   the taurus is well known for its safety   besides being a wonderful family car   it looks more than nice enough for any business executive to drive as well   this is by far the best car that we have owned     
1325,1,  i own a   taurus and i have been very pleased with it   i bought it in november of   and haven t had an ounce of trouble with it   we bought this vehicle because i had previously been driving a pontiac grand am and after the birth of our second child we decided that we needed more space   i am in my twenties and i wasn t ready to get   quot the family van quot   and felt that the taurus looked sporty or   quot cool quot   enough but still served the purpose of a family car   some of the many things that i love about this car is the stereo system the sound is great   the engine is quiet so quiet that one time when i was in a huge hurry i actually ran into a store and left my keys in the ignition and left the car running   i didn t realize until i returned to the car   thank goodness it was still there   that i had forgot to turn the car off   i also love how quickly the car cools off in the summer and warms up in the winter   we ve driven this car on   hour road trips and it has been a dream to ride in it s very comfortable whether you are the driver or the passenger   in my opinion   the person who would get the most pleasure from buying this vehicle is someone who wants a really good dependable car possibly with a family that doesn t want to buy a van or larger vehicle   it would also be perfect for a person who does a lot of travelling via automobile   for families with more than   children i would not suggest this car for them because the back seat would be too snug especially if your children are using car seats or booster seats br br  
1326,1,  brown wood grain siding   on a car   i know you remember those long brown station wagons   i learned how to drive in one of those station wagons   i referred to my parents car as the tank   i have had my taurus wagon for two years now   the wagon seats   people   we have the third backwards seat i never thought i would see myself saying   quot yes   i want a wagon quot   but i did   we were trading in our windstar mini van which i liked but really did not want another mini van when i began my search for the perfect wagon   we checked out the camry but the drivers seat felt small and there was virtually no leg room for the middle seats   we still needed space   yet i didn t feel i needed to move around in it like you would in a van   having three kids we felt we needed that third seat   the wagaon drives smoothly and i have not had any trouble at all with it   we take it in periodically for maintenance upkeep i absolutely love my car however   my husband feels a little cramped compared to the open feeling you have in a van   otherwise he loves the smooth and quiet ride you get   are kids have had one complaint   however   no cup holders   once you get them use to a van with a cup holder in every corner it is hard to go back     
1327,1,  we have owned our   taurus for nearly two whole years and have had absolutely no problems or complaints   i would definitely choose this model over any other car product   especially a probe   the car has more power than you can imagine with a v installed   it will go from zero to sixty in just a few seconds   i have never rode in a faster car than this one   it is not even considered a sports car and still has the engine and a semi sporty type look   the car gets excellent gas mileage   too   on the highway it rides perfectly smooth without any bumps or loud   annoying noises that most cars make   it even has cruise control   i would be going   and let off the cruise control on the highway   and the car would still be between   and   for almost a whole entire mile   i thought this was incredible   it is comfortable for five and even six people to fit comfortably   the seats are very spacious and comfortable   especially in the back   i could live in the back of this car if i chose   there is so much room   the trunk is also full of vacant space as well   the front has an endless amount of compartments and unique options to make it easier for both the driver and passengers   it has airbags for both front seats to improve the safety   and also has air conditioning   you can add a disc changer to the car if you desire which would be very convenient because the receiver is programmed for this   you will just have to switch from radio to cd player and there is no hassle   could have done away with their rather large   round receivers and installed a regular sized one which makes it easier to install your own cd player   but i guess a cd changer was a good idea   the taurus would be ideal for a large family of five   it is the perfect car for the cheap price that it is   it handles well in all four seasons   i would highly recommend this car to anyone looking at buying a car that will last a long while   it is worth a test drive or at least a look inside     
1328,1,  we are on our th taurus   the   sable   l met it s fate during a winter storm and a tree   wife walked away with a sore shoulder   we had k and no problems   i had a   wagon with k and traded it in when i found the i wanted   my wife is on her nd   gen   the   dohc is by far the best car we have ever owned   plenty of power   great mpg   and enough room for our family of    with family    hours away and   small kids   road trip comfort is very important   the k model is by far the best refined edition of this car   the same basic chassis since its   introduction   it is even used as the base for the windstar   if we can afford it when we go for our next car   we will probably upgrade to the   star br br  
1329,1,  my grandmother gave me this   taurus brand new    a pleasant surprise and a wonderful blessing   it probably would not be one that i would have bought myself   but it has definitely been a good car   shortly after i got it i moved up north and had to learn to drive in the snow   it was very reliable and i have since safely moved back home with not a ding on it   that was better than i hoped for   cuz i knew this southerner did not know a thing about driving in the white stuff    and there was a lot of it   too i have now had the car almost   years and in    miles its only been in the shop   times   i do not consider that excessive   one time was an ignition switch and the other was something with the power steering   the ignition problem was while it was still under the original warranty   the ignition switch problem did leave me stranded as it gave no warning    just died   but   since it hasn t happened again   i ve forgiven the car its indiscretion of breaking   the car has had reasonable gas mileage    about what it says on the sticker   i find it quite comfortable to drive as well   a taurus is not a flashy car   but it is very utilitarian and that s good too   i think the trunk is a nice size i don t have a complaint in the world about this car for what it is    a car to get you around reliably   its not sporty or anything   but it is a good car  
1330,1,  if you re in the market for a heavy duty pick up   i d like to offer you some suggestions   i have two f super duties and have driven the ram    based on my experience with these vehicles and others   here s what i think would be the ultimate truck it should be an extended cab   four door   long bed   diesel powered    manually shifted     ton     four wheel drive truck with shift on the fly   auto locking hubs   limited slip differential   four wheel anti lock disc brakes and powered drivers seat in a medium trim level   here s why extended cab    gives you comfortable seating for up to six adults   additional cab storage and is still maneuverable   when you go to the full crew cab    long bed version you loose big on maneuverability     ft   turning radius   and don t gain that much in seating and interior storage   if you are a contractor ferrying crews and equipment from job to job that s a different story four doors    this is just a matter of convenience   having had them i can t imagine an extended cab truck without them   long bed    if you re buying a truck to haul cargo you ll want the   ft   bed   you ll never complain about the bed being too long   but if you go with the short bed   sooner or later you re there will be something that you can t haul   another reason for the long bed is improved ride    the extra    or so of additional wheelbase length makes a big difference limousine effect diesel powered    being underpowered is the last thing you want in a heavy duty truck   you put yourself and other motorists at risk if you can t keep up with the normal flow of traffic   today s modern turbo charged   inner cooled   waste gated diesel engines are powerful   reliable   long lasting and efficient   you ll recoup most of your   or   grand initial investment at trade in   in the meantime   you ll be getting superior mileage and more raw torque than any available gas engine   and a    mile warranty to boot manually shifted    for better control in adverse driving conditions   the auto shifters i ve driven have a time lag    especially when starting from a dead stop    when you push down on the accelerator before you start moving that is annoying and possibly unsafe   this lull protects the transmission from torque overload but also degrades drivability    ton    has a much smoother ride and has no effect on trailer towing ability versus a   ton truck   again   if you re a contractor hauling heavy loads on the truck itself    go with the   ton four wheel drive    versatility   go most anywhere and do most anything     a must have for mud or snow shift on the fly    can t imagine having to stop in order to shift into four wheel drive   if you re in deep dodo you want to keep your momentum auto locking hubs    you don t want to get out of the truck to engage the front hubs   see deep dodo above limited slip differential    there s way to much power with the diesel to only drive one rear tire   in my opinion this is an absolute must four wheel anti lock disc brakes    another absolute must   there s just no sense in not being able to stop your truck safely and controllably powered drivers seat    enables a comfortable and safe driving position for various drivers   shorter drivers especially will want this feature medium trim level    you get a lot of convenience and appearance options for a small price   and increases resale value i hope this will be of help if you re considering purchasing one of these trucks   they are a considerable investment that you can t exchange once you drive it off the lot   well   that s my epinion of the ultimate heavy duty truck   why did i put it under the f super duty category   because   i think this vehicle    equipped as described above    is as close as you can come to the ideal truck br br  
1331,1,  i have a    wd extended cab xlt with the gas v   engine   i have plenty of power to haul a   pound camper i blow by those diesels chugging up the rockies every day with this engine   i get up to   mpg without a load and down to   mpg loaded on mountain roads with the automatic   this is my first automatic and i must say it is very smooth   in    miles i ve had no problems and have visited the shop only for fluid changes and several recall notices   i have added extra overload springs as i felt the single factory springs that came with the camper package was not enough for the size camper i have on it   i would consider putting on larger tires when running at maximum gross vehicle weight like i do   although the stock aluminum rims with general tires still have about half the tread at m with the automatic and the on the fly wd switch i have even more room up front with nothing cluttering the floor   i d recommend the optional electric camper mirrors   this truck is a tight and smooth runner     
1332,1,  my family recently purchased a   f   door   x   with the triton v   engine   i am extremely satisfied with this truck   the interior is very comfortable   and there is a lot of room   many vehicles made today are based on economy   and are therefore made small   not this truck   this truck is based on the old saying   quot bigger is better quot   even though the extra sizes makes it not that good on gas mileage   the comfort and style of it well makes up for that   it s towing   hauling   and plowing power is amazing   some trucks are made for work   some trucks are made to look and ride nice   this is a work truck that looks and rides nice   i ve put the truck through it s hurdles   i ve tested the acceleration   the brakes   and the shocks many   many times   after running this truck up and down fields   through mud pits   and through the woods   i have come to the conclusion that this truck will not only take everything i through at it   but it will through it right back at me br br  
1333,1,  we have been a family for the past   years   and will not change   the previous f   truck we owned had    miles on the engine before we traded it in for another and the only reason we traded it in was   that it was not a x   we were truck hunting at van boxtel in green bay during an ice storm   we spotted the black x   in there lot   it was in a   condition   unsure   whether or not we would purchase another at this time   because our truck ran perfectly   we were going to leave and let them know what our decision was the next day   well low and behold we could not make it out of there lot because of the ice   so we backed down to the door and purchased the new vehicle   that was   years ago and now we are at the    mile on this engine and have not had any problems with it nor does it use oil   gas mileage is at   gallon and we sure can t complain on the comfort of the drive   we use this vehicle not only for recreation but as a work vehicle also   another way to make sure your engines last is to do regular maintance and always use the same brand of oil and the same brand oil filter     
1334,1,  headline   avid honda owner trades for all american made rear wheel drive after   wonderful years of honda accord ownership   i ll save that story for another epinion   i traded in my champaign colored   accord lx for a    liter v   equipped   thunderbird in early    ah   the car of my dreams   there are many   since my friend mark potter bought a   thunderbird back in   i only paid a couple thousand more for the one year old t bird than my new honda back in     what a great deal   and this has been a fun and reliable car   i feel spoiled by all that power spinning the rear wheels   and the optional traction control really works   you try to scoot the back end out from under you but you can t unless you push that little white button hidden in the console to defeat the system   however   in the rain you better watch out   the back end tends to slip during relatively slow turns when the road is slick i like power   but not for power s sake   i like knowing that i m able to launch up a freeway onramp without the fear that i won t be up to speed while merging with that big rig doing   mph   this car gives you all the merging confidence you need with power to spare while you receive many benefits from having such a large power plant under the hood you sacrifice gas mileage in a big way   if you drive conservatively you may be able to wring   mpg out of a t bird   but if your heavy foot wins over reason much of the time be prepared to give up more cash at the shell station for that privilege to the tune of   or   mpg    or even less if you really like racing the fit and finish of most american cars have been in question since the   s so i was pleased to find that this car was well put together   body seams are straight and even   and interior members are held in place with relatively few rattles   there are body flex noises at times   but in a car with such rigid construction something has to give rigid construction is a major player in handling   and this t bird handles well while flying low and straight on the freeway   and gets only a moderate rating in tight corners   why   for a car this size it should be much lighter   it tends to push the front end while cornering and doesn t reassure the driver the way many lighter   front wheel drive cars flatly tackle tight turns   however   for such a beefy ride it eeks out adequate performance the maintenance has been quite minimal with the first major tune up due at k   i m only at k   changing and checking the fluids are quite easy with s signature yellow color coding under the hood helping you find all the different fluid intakes to keep your v   running smoothly    this car loves maintenance and pays you back with smooth performance i ve considered trading in this car for an suv   but i can t seem to part with it   whenever i get back in the drivers seat and fire up that big engine i m glad i have the power   luxury   comfort and security of a large american car features    liter v   traction control abs factory alarm moon roof leather wrapped steering wheel alloy wheels power antenna power drivers seat   
1335,1,  i never even gave a thought to drive any sort of vehicle until it came time to replace my   subaru gl hatchback with    miles   there it was in the capital district auto guide   staring me in the face   my moonlight blue clearcoat metallic   thunderbird   it just looked like a really sweet car   the color and the white letter tires on it did it   the right price   and the right mileage      ensured that my dad would be willing to co sign the loan   two problems   rear wheel drive and    liter v   we live in new york   i m a young kid and i ve only driven tiny subaru s   but fortunately   he went for it anyway   i dragged my sister down to the dealership with me and we took it for a test drive   the dealer started it   and i was very enthusiastic about the sound of the engine   the car was beautiful   and kept very clean   i drove it and was amazed by the way it handled and the way it felt just to be in the driver s seat   of course   it could have been because i d never driven such a powerful car before   and nothing newer than a    my father s daytona   i put a deposit down on the car that day   i went home   my dad said   it s cool   i took the next day off work and got insurance and purchasing matters taken care of   it was mine   i could pick it up that night if only the rest of the process had gone so smoothly   i couldn t pick the car up from the dealer for almost a week because there was    worth of work to be done to it   why hadn t it been done before the car was put up for sale   i don t care   i want my t bird   gimmie   finally i got the car and about a week later   the oil pressure gauge would slip down to   and the check gauges light would come on every time i stopped at a stoplight   now   in my subie s   the oil pressure would slip down at a stoplight   but the light would never come on   and it was normal   in the thunderbird   the oil pressure gauge stood steadily in the middle all the time   and the light coming on caused me to have all sorts of worry   but besides that   it ran fine   i brought it into the shop and it needed a new oil pump   they said   i ended up in a rental car   driving an escort   wonderful   the car was supposed to be in the shop a week   but it was only there for three days   i went and got the car back and that night   sure enough   i stopped at a light on the way to work and the oil pressure went down to low and the light came on   i screamed and hit the horn     then i drove to work and had it towed in   of course   it got towed to the wrong dealership   then   they found out that i had somehow blown a bearing in the crankshaft   i was none too happy to hear about that   but it was fixed for free   and i figured that if something else substantial happened to it   i could apply the lemon law to it but after that   it ran just dandy   i ve had a few problems with it   my gas line started to leak because it had been rubbing up against a sharp edge on the gas tank and it rotted   but this was covered by my warranty   the cruise control module broke   the windshield washer fluid no longer dispenses   and last but not least   one day i came back from lunch and went to shut the car off to find that the car would not shut off   i had to have the battery disconnected and have it towed   come to find out   some plastic pin had broken off inside the steering column   and i had to pay for just labor    and this was at the first day of my new job   thanks   car   not covered by warranty   figure that one out   but after the pieces of doody i ve driven this stuff is all minor   now the car has    miles on it   and i hope nothing else goes wrong with it   the warranty is up   i have taken this car on so many road trips it s amazing   i live in albany   and i drive to massachusetts all the time   i ve driven to cape cod twice   i drove to manhattan once   and one time going to cape cod and the drive to manhattan were both complete spur of the moment trips   i ve owned the car for almost two years now and put    miles on it   that s twice the average   considering how much i drive this car and pound the doody out of it   the things that have gone wrong with it are pretty insignificant   it s a beautiful car   lots of potential for modifications   i only wish for a v   leather    speed   and i think instead of buying a new car   i want to trade this in on a    with the v and leather   i put a kenwood deck in it   all new kenwood speakers in the doors and in the rear   i had the basic cassette tape player when i bought the car   and i thought it was terrible   a kenwood changer in the trunk and    quot   jl audio s and a kicker amp in the trunk   even with all that stuff in the trunk   i can still fit a good amount of groceries back there   and there s always the backseat   it s usually just me and dave in the car   so i don t even worry about it   but i find that the backseat is pretty damn big compared to the subaru s i ve driven and the escort s and sentra s you see all over the place   i have the    liter v   and it s quick   but it could be a lot quicker   the    jetta my dad s driving now is a lot quicker   but with the thunderbird   highway driving is something else   it feels like you re at a standstill doing    i ve never had that before   it s one of the best feelings in the world   and speeding up on the highway is very effortless   i can make the tires squeal pretty easily   i love rear wheel drive   i just put studded tires on the back last winter and didn t have a problem at all in the snow   i didn t even have anything in the trunk except the speakers   i feel pretty powerful driving this beast   too   it s comfortable and the car is very responsive   i can take curves at a very scary speed   i got into an accident with this car   wrecked the front end on some poor kid s saab in the rain while trying to merge   and when i drove the rental   lumina   i noticed how badly it handled around curves   and then i realized that i d taken the thunderbird s handling for granted   it handled a lot better than anything else i d driven i love this car so much   i really want a    with a v and leather   and i m not real thrilled about the job the body shop did on the front end   and i m also really scared because of all those head gasket horror stories but this car is like a part of me   i love being able to tell people that i drive a thunderbird   and i want to be able to do that as long as possible   and i know i can t spend forty grand next year i also have turned into a car snob because this car just screams   quot beefcake quot   while all these pimped out honda civics try to do the same but come on i give it a ten   chuck shame i can t post a picture br br  
1336,1,  i am very impressed with this large people hauler   the overall quality of this vehicle seems to be higher than what i have seen on gm and dc vans   first impressions   i knew at first these were large vehicles   i also knew that i would be hauling around   passengers   scary thought at first   especially since i had never before had the chance to drive an extended version of the club wagon   overall   i have to admit once i began driving this vehicle i fell in love with it   the interior of the van was rather quiet considering there were about a dozen people conversing   the ride was very smooth over all pavement except for on grooved pavement   handling was good and the van seemed to hold to curves very well considering it s size   city driving also wasn t very hard   only caution i have is to not cut your right turns to close or you ll go for a joy ride over the curb   now that i have driven one and am a college student who hauls around a lot of stuff and people i am looking to purchase one of my own within the next year and a half   why get one   good towing capacity   hauling capacity   and people mover   and the biggest factor reliability on this van is great   i know many who have had great experience with the econoline   i only hope if i get one i have the same great experience br br  
1337,1,  i just graduated from college   moved to a new city   and needed a car   i didn t want very much   just a cheap car with good gas mileage   i was willing to sacrifice looks   endure insults from friends   even deal with some visits to the shop in short i would have settled for a hyundai   kia   or a yugo if they still made them   i thought that with such standards finding a car would be easy   but as i did my research i realized that it wasn t the gas mileage most economy cars get was a big surprise to me   considering the lack of size and horsepower that defines most economy car engines i expected my high gas mileage requirement to be easily filled however no car under   k did that   granted i want more than most people seem to from reading other opinions on numerous cars   i am fairly environmentally conscious and i would buy the honda insight in a second if i could afford it   i expected a car with at least   miles a gallon in the city and in the s on the highway   if you want that too don t bother looking under   k   echo   corolla or civic are your only options   about   city   high way   golf and jetta as well if you raise the price bar a bit more   most economy cars are rated about mid s in the city and high s low s on the highway   i am not sure why people are impressed with this gas mileage my    buick skylark was getting about    and that thing is old   heavy   and had   i think    l i that was definitely not multi valve   some of my friends have suvs that get low s high s   anyway   another way to think about it   if the weight is light and the engine is small what accounts for gas mileage that is    less than something like a corolla   i d call it bad engineering   may be engine timing isn t as good   may be compression ration is low   may be transmission sucks   probably all of the above and more   i was seriously considering getting a corolla    echo gets expensive quick after you add some necessary   options   it is a great car   my dad owns one and i drive it a lot   reliable   great resale value   great gas mileage   quiet   etc   i didn t really want to spend k though   i probably would have gotten one   or a hyundai accent   if my friend didn t work at   because i could get a good deal i decided to check out some cars   i am not the biggest fan of and even though i own one now i definitely can t say i trust it   but with dealer and factory incentives thrown in the escort was the best deal i found   believe me   i looked at every economy car more times than i ever thought i d need to   and it is definitely one of the best looking compacts out there i don t want to bore you with the details of everything you get in this car   i would recommend that you go to the site and check it out   but here is a short list of things that escort had that many others didn t   rear defogger   yeah   really     tires   aluminum wheels   cassette deck   remote trunk     seats   spoiler   power mirrors   tachometer   intermittent wipers   etc   also   you get keyless entry if you opt for the power group   in no other car i found do you get as much included and after all is said and done the car was less than   without the college rebate   i didn t end up using my friend at this was a lower a price than he could get i also think it is the best looking car under   k and it holds its own for higher priced cars   most people compliment me on the car and everyone thinks it cost a lot more   so i didn t have to deal with insults from friends after all     and it doesn t say escort on it anywhere if you get the   model i had the car for about   months and   miles including some long road trips   one thing to note is that it is a four seater   there is no middle seat belt   check the roominess stats on your favorite car web site it isn t much   even corolla has more hip room in the back   but it is enough   four people are comfortable and five people is manageable   there was no complaining from three passengers in the back after over eight hours in the car   and i got my share back there too also   the trunk is small   coupes are not hatchbacks   as far as trunk room you d do better with almost anything else   echo   focus   corolla   civic   except may be for the accent   but again   i think the trunk is sufficient    people fit their stuff for a   days trip with no problems   including sleeping bags ok   now for actual driving the car is noisy   perhaps not too noisy if you are used to driving ferrari s but it is very noisy if you are used to corollas   noise is definitely hard to ignore if the radio is off it is virtually impossible   having a conversation with someone is hard with normal voice   road and wind noise are enough but the engine also makes a lot more noise after about   rpms   and then there is a lot more noise after about   rpms   my recommendation is test drive it   take it on the highway roll the windows up and see if its managable   oh   turn the radio and the sales person off until you want them back on the engine is pretty fast and the tranny is responsive   unfortunately this is my first manual transmission car so my opinion is fairly unsubstantiated   somewhere i saw the acceleration stat of    in    seconds   it seems about right and this is fast for a compact   its on par with cars like the eclipse   the other day i left a zx in the dust yeah yeah you don t have to tell me he was probably asleep   but it still felt nice   seriously though   this car is fast enough to be fun   no old lady will pass you as you are trying to merge you will need to shift a little more the gear ratio is definitely shifted to the low end   expect to shift out of first almost immediately and expect to be in th at about    if you want power though nd gear will carry you into the s   oh and a huge disappointment to me the transmission is not overdrive   it is listed as overdrive on a number of websites and i thought it was but it isn t   expect about rpms at mph   my guess is this is largely responsible for low gas mileage   reported    although i ve been getting more like    though its still early to count as far as raw speed passing power   rest assured there is enough of it   i was a little concerned with the engine being at rpms at mph but there is no reason to be   i trust you ll keep this a secret but on a recent road trip i took the car up to about mph with a full trunk and   people in the car   and the engine was still comfortable at around rpms   red line is at    assuming there is no governor on it this car will easily top out the speedometer     now the point isn t that you should drive that fast   the tires are only b rated    but to convince you that there is plenty of extra power to pass even at high speeds as far as reliability i still don t really trust it   it doesn t really feel like a solidly built car although i am sure   don t know though   that it compares very well with cars in the k range   and supposedly the reliability ratings for new escorts have been decent   one example of questionable cost cutting is that the alternator is rated at amps and is a heavy duty model   most cars   in fact all other cars i saw   use at least an amp alternator   odds are the thing will need replacement early especially if you are using lots of utilities on the car i think this review is getting pretty long but hopefully i gave you more than a re listing of features you can find anywhere else   for the money it was a good car   i sacrificed gas mileage and reliability to get this deal   if those things are very important go with a corolla or a civic you will make up the difference in price when you sell   i checked blue book values   if you want bottom priced car and can get this car for around   k without options i think you are getting a better deal than you would with an accent or a kia rio   if above else you want a good looking car with some pep for cheap this is definitely among the strongest contenders especially if they offer    back again   however   if you see yourself spending   k or so on this car i would definitely say give some other cars a very close look another thing to remember is that this is either the last year or close to it for the escort   the focus is replacing this car and the zx has the same engine but is a much better overall car   without cash back the two cars cost almost the same  
1338,1,  about   months ago   i purchased a brand new   zx right off the lot   and since then i ve learned a whole lot about cars   including one thing   this car tricked me into buying it   it has a sleek   sexy exterior   as well as a playfully agressive stance that looks very sporty and fast   the interior has very comfortable seating   and the   cyl z tech engine peels this little car off the line every time you floor the gas   but if you re looking for a contender in the sports car class   this isn t it   don t let it trick you too   those of you who are interested in building a hot street racer or just tricking out your car for fun should definately get this car   there is room for improvement in all areas   and if you re seen driving this car with some hot ground effects on it   you ll definately turn heads   because not many parts are out for the zx   if you really want something that can talk the talk and walk the walk from off the lot   then you might want to consider another car   such as the vw jetta or the honda prelude   however   if you re looking for a beautiful and affordable ride that looks and feels sexy and sporty   but won t get you a ticket   this is the car for you   i bought the zx because   at the time   i just wanted something new   fully loaded   and affordable   and this is what i ended up with   in retrospect   i would have much rather invested my money in something with less extras and more horses   if the were a bar of soap   the zx is what it would look like after about   uses   i think everyone looking for a new   sporty and affordable car should at least give the escort a test drive   it s such a well rounded   banger for the price that it s hard to form an opinion for or against the car   you ll just have to go see for yourself  
1339,1,  i ordered my zx on jan    before i read the opinions already written   i now have around    miles on it and i really like the car a lot i was ready to hate the car because it took   weeks from day of order to day of delivery   i was also prepared to be disappointed in the performance of the car because i read some of the negative comments on this page   neither have been the case the car is a   speed with cruise control which works extremely well even on hills   i ve been driving small fords since   when i got a pinto and have gone through the pintos and the escorts ever since   this car is as good or better than any of the others that we ve owned   it s fun to drive very comfortable for the two of us that own it and use it   it wouldn t be a good choice for a family only seats   but it does have a good sized trunk   my gas mileage is regularly in the   mph range   i do a lot of short trips and a few   mile trips and the mileage has been around   every time we ve filled it   i didn t get the cd in it   just the radio and cassette player so have no problem with a cd changer in the trunk   it does step right out when you want to go unlike some cars that take forever to reach the   speed limit on our expressways   the only problem i have at this time is that we can t find a good place to mount the   deer whistlers   that we put on all of our vehicles   i ended up paying a little under     for the car with cruise control   comfort group which included air conditioning   and the power package which gave me power windows   door locks and keyless entry   that was after a     rebate   i haven t even found any little things that require taking it back to the dealer like you usually do when you buy a new car   or used one for that matter  
1340,1,  due to the many emails and enquiries i have had concerning my original epinion on the   probe   i am writing an update to that epinion   for some reason epinions won t let me edit my old epinion   and so i am writing a new one   the old epinion can be found at   crimson epinions auto review f eacd fda bd it s now been a year since i wrote the first epinion on my   probe   and i would like to say that the car is   still   running great   although i have had to do a few more repairs   the car is nearly   years old now and i have had it for    it s now got near enough to    miles   the body is still solid and showing very few signs of rust   although the ohio weather has not been great on some of the underside   the brakes have started making horrid noise in reverse and i haven t yet been able to figure out why even though i have changed all the brakes the other problem that has recently cropped up is with the factory cd player and stereo   the lights in the lcd radio display have burned out and the cd player is being less than cooperative these days   it seems that the cd player uses a plastic gear system to pull the cd in and out of the player and i believe that a few cogs have broken off of the gears   sometimes the cd will not go all the way in and begins to make an awful clicking sound i think that the lazer is near to burning out as well   it tends to skip alot easier these days   however the stereo is a minor detail and really   i m quite surprised it has lasted this long the original factory paint has faded a good deal as well   the roof of the car has become somewhat dull over the past few years and the paint seems to be rather thin up there by now i don t know that this is due to poor craftmanship or whether it s due to ohio s harsh weather i still highly recommend the   probe however because of the general reliability of the car and the lack of major repair work that i have had to do on it   i recently drove the car all the way to chicago from ohio and this was a   hour drive and we spent a good hour and a half sitting in a traffic jam the car did not overheat at all and we made it nearly the entire way on one tank of gas i didn t have to fill up till we got within   minutes of chicago   and if it weren t for the huge traffic jam   we probably would have made it all the way without needing to fill up again br br  
1341,1,  i bought my   probe lx    l v   about   years ago   since then i ve had to replace the brakes   front rotors   the radiator and a few radiator hoses   a power steering hose   and the rear wiper   also   it is in need of some new injectors   it now has k miles   these are all expected normal wear and tear items   the and transmission have been rock solid   the   l is a really tough no wonder it is in just about all the other fords     taurus sable   aerostar windstar   tempo topaz   and the mazda pickups   the manual transmission is very strong and it shifts very smoothly and is the perfect match to the   l v   handling on snow and ice are pretty good if you are careful    studded or all season tires help tremendously   i basically have no problems dropping a gear and passing people if i have to   there is plenty of trunk space under the hatch and good space up front   however typical of a car like this the rear seats are fairly cramped   the perspective from the drivers seat is excellent   you can raise or lower your seat with the automatic controls on the side as well to help with visibility and comfort   i really like being able to see the hood when i drive as well as the pop up headlights   good for aiming the car down the road all of the power options are nice   power windows   power steering   power seats   power mirrors   power antenna   etc   anti lock brakes come in handy on ice believe me   i know living in alaska   for you gear heads into modifying cars the    seems to be very responsive   i installed a cat back exhaust w high flow muffler   and a k n filter   the thing growls and rumbles alot like a v   suprises alot of honda and other   cyl owners out there   cars that i owned previous to this one    escort    toyota celica gt    toyota celica gt s    nissan sx    mitsubishi eclipse gs  
1342,1,  now first off my title might be a bit misleading   owning an escort doesn t make you spoiled by any means   its not like my parents went out and bought me luxury car or anything   as a matter of fact my parents didn t go out and buy me anything   i bought it myself   and i also make my own insurance payments   i am not looking for wide spread acclaim by stating that just that i am not a materialistic suburban brat    now to the car b i love my car    the zx   i own the four door model which is quite different than the zx pictured by opinions   mine is actually the exact car they show in the   escort picture only mines a     the zx is a two door model that has more of a pinched tail end   and a bit more of a bullet shape overall   it s the   sporty escort   my best friend owns a zx and she couldn t be more pleased with it   although its not the car of her dreams it is still her baby   and she couldn t be happier    the sedan   most people don t associate a   real   car with the escort name   i have heard time and again   wow escorts have changed this is like i a car i   now as intellectual as this comment might sound it is all to true up until recent years escorts have been cheep looking hatchbacks   the escort of today has a much larger body and a spacey interior   the sad news is that you can say goodbye to the sedan   after   they are being replaced by the focus which is an equally cute car if you ask me   but the escort legacy isn t going to dye so soon   is planning on keeping the zx around for a while b my ties to the escort   this is my third escort   yes my third   when i first got my license i drove around in the car my step grandmother had driven since she bought it brand new in    ha   yes   i drove an   manual escort with no air conditioning   or any other perks for that matter including a radio   not to mention the    miles it had racked up   but that was just fine   i loved it because it was a car   it was   my   car   however   it started to encounter some mechanical problems   finally   and we   the   rents and my self   thought best if i got a bit newer car because they didn t want me to be a   year old female stranded on the road somewhere   so i went with them to get a newer car   we got a   escort   this one had air   a cd player   power mirrors   and power seatbelts so i did manage to get some more stuff   that was a plus but not necessity   i grew to love that car   i really did   the only problem it has was one of the speakers had been blown out by the previous owner   but the problem was solved when i asked my mom buy me speakers for christmas   then the next problem came my cd player died   i was able to pick up a pioneer flip face cd player   nice stuff   at best buy on sale   it cost me    but it was nice   and it has and will last me for quite some time   for a surprise my mom paid for that for my birthday though   she didn t have to and i told her that   but she did and i love it   and those were the only two problems i ever had with the car   just the audio system   other than that i loved it and it loved me   however   a couple of months back i learned the inevitable lesson that you can t drive through other cars   and i lost my car to the   totaled   gods   because i bought the car so cheep   i worked my finagling powers   i ended up making a bit of cash off the wreck   because when the car is totaled the insurance gives you market value of the car   so after a month of no car i went on a search for another car   with the money i had made off the accident i was able to spring for a nicer car   although i was looking at   s originally   i realized that i could spend about the same for a    at the time i thought i had a job that was an hour or more away so i sprung for the     again i love my car   i have an automatic   remote keyless entry   power mirrors and all that fun stuff   i honestly love my car   and better yet   i was able to get the old speakers and cd player installed into the new car   so everything is great   mechanically the car is wonderful b my friends do it so should i   all of my friends sadly own escorts   it is a very practical car for a teenager to drive   they are cheep   have great gas mileage   cheep to insure i mean come on how perfect is that m   drives a   zx   so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil changes   l   owns a   four door   so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil changes   j   owns a   two door so far only problem was when car was side swiped and insurance paid for the fixing   out side of that no costs outside of gas and oil changes   me and l   own    four door sedans   surprise   surprise   so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil chnges   b   owns a    neon poor   poor b   has had to put her car in the shop for the   check engine light   poor   poor girl she should have bought an escort b the car i haven t told you about the car   what is there to say   i have no complaints   it says something that i have gone out and bought two of the same car   it says something that the   escort with    miles was still going   fords have a bad rep   with some people   maybe they have been burned before   but i am happy as a pig in mud   i could sit here and tell you that the car has decent pick up   i can tell you that i have had nothing but success   i could even tell you about how comfortable the seats are but i think the fact that so many are on the road lets the car speak for itself    have you driven a lately b br br  
1343,1,  my husband and i were looking for a new vehicle our first   and decided on a escort   the price was right between eleven and twelve thousand dollars   and the four doors are appropriate for a family of four   the back seat fits   car seats   but not much else   trunk space is great if you are going on a nearby vacation or camping somewhere   it fits a stroller   diaper bag   and other baby supplies beautifully   driving is smooth   but the passengers feel all bumps   the one thing i really dislike about my car is the engine noise is extremely loud   you hear every little shift and brake the car makes   one of the bonuses though is the power brakes   steering   windows and doors   there is expandable leg room for the front   and the bucket seats also recline   i really feel this car is great in price   size   and comfort for new parents   i love to drive my car   and with   kids   everything seems to fit well into the trunk for long trips to the grocery store or grandma s house     
1344,1,  about a year and    ago my went in my   cavalier   so i started to look for a used car   i was looking for something a little sporty but reasonable to afford   because my kids are older and have their own cars now i do not need the old fashion station wagons to cart them and their friends around in   i looked at many models and at many dealers   i found a few to be at my interest   after review loan and interest with banks i found that buying a brand new car my payment would be fairly close to the payment for a used car   i decided at that point to look at the   escorts   i went to the dealer and the model that was in the show room was an awesome color   very sporty looking   it didn t have all the option i was looking for so the dealing order up the parts and had the options added   i took it for a test drive and bought it   i never had a brand new car before so this was very exciting   i have it it for one year now and i love it   it has power locks   sunroof   rear spoiler   mag wheel and lots of power   i would just like you all to know before purchasing a used car and someone else s headache check into what it will cost you to buy a brand new one   it s well worth the feeling of owning a brand new one br br  
1345,1,  i recently purchased a   escort   the handled my questions quickly and efficiently my car was and is a great buy   it gets great mileage and a full tank usually costs around     with gas prices being      the escort is a nice economy sized car and is excellent for the whole family   the back seat can be pulled down for more room for larger things   the trunk is midsize and can fit almost anything   the crash rating is high   i had a little fender bender and fixed it quickly in a week or less   the sound system makes you feel like you are there at a concert   even better is that some escorts have a   cd changer in them problems with the escort is the bumpy ride   i am used to bigger cars   this is quite a change   more noise retention is needed with this car   this car is small and along with it come small shocks   the tire rims always need cleaning   i can clean them and go driving for an hour just to come back and have them dirty again   the windshield wipers wash the rain off but some of it stays on the side of the window   the wind pushes you around also and can be scary at times this is a great car   i bought it because i like small cars and i feel safe in it   the drive   once you get used to it   is nice br br  
1346,1,  i am   years old and have had my zx for a little over a year   i m happy to say that it has proved to be quite reliable   when i went looking for my first car my father and i looked at every conceivable small car on the market   tercel   corolla   civic   protege   contour   mirage   saturn sl   and sentra   except for the saturn all of these small cars were excellent   the saturn is sold by great dealers   but the car itself is unrefined   so why did i buy the zx   well   first off the zx had the most horsepower     only the contour with the v   had more     also i had just read an article in the may   issue of car and driver in which the zx came in first place when compared to other small coupes   moreover   consumer s reports had rated the   model at above average reliability   something that other domestic sedans   cavalier and neon   could not say   but enough with the boring stuff what the car is like in action is what convinced me to buy   performance   i can t say enough about this car s acceleration   but    in    seconds should sum it up pretty well   the car has plenty of power in th gear   therefore when i want to pass on the parkway a downshift into th is not needed   there are some drawbacks to this engine though   it is kind of noisy at speeds above    rpm   but that s o k   most small   cylinders are   more annoying is that when the a c is on the compressor is always cycling   turning on and off   and it makes it feel as though the car has misfired   however   after reading some newspaper articles about the zx it turns out this is normal   intended the a c to cycle to save gas   once the engine gets this car moving the suspension does not let you down   the handling is awesome    this car inspires confidence in the driver   and the tires have never squealed on me yet   the ride is pretty good too   most of the large potholes are absorbed well   and the suspension makes a nice thud noise   braking is o k   my car is equipped with abs   but the brakes don t have an initial grippy feel interior   the seats are nicely shaped up front   and the back seat is not bad for hauling around friends   i just recently completed a two hour road trip   and the car proved comfortable coming and going   the cruise control keeps the set speed very well   the factory installed power moon roof has never leaked   no problems with the power windows   locks   or keyless entry   i did have an after market cd player put in the dash   and because of the oval pod i had to pay    to get a special faceplate   overall   i am very pleased with my decision to buy the zx   there are times   however   when i would have liked to have the extra two doors of a sedan   but whenever i long for those two doors the admiring looks i get from other drivers in their dowdy sedans   suvs   and minivans always changes my mind   not to mention the internal joy i get when i drive this car   it is just plain fun     
1347,1,  the zx seems to be breaking away from the overall   quot escort quot   category   while there is still a small   quot escort quot   on the back   there is a large zx in script on the rear window   rear bumper and on the backs of the front seats   and there s a good reason for this this isn t an escort   it s more like a slightly smaller probe   the engine is a contour engine so it has a bit more getup and go   it still pulls a bit too much rpm when you floor it   but it s better than a plymouth breeze or stratus   inside there is surprising room   i m    quot   tall and i actually have headroom   shoulder room is a little less   but it s less in everything but the most   quot luxury quot   cars these days   there actually seems to be more leg room than there is in the taurus   the car looks sporty   which is something you can t say about any of the other fords   save the   and the has rear wheel drive and costs a couple grand more   the car does sit a little higher off of the road than most sporty vehicles   it handles well but doesn t quit stick to the corner   gearing is good   the automatic transmission is smooth   the model i purchased came with everything   power windows   power doors   a   cd changer   power mirrors   anchored floor mats   fancy wheels   larger tires   tilt steering wheel and the price tag was still around   k   to get the same ammenities on any other car i looked out would have taken the price over the   k mark   the seats are nicely designed   but slightly small   if you re not over    and not over   lbs you probably won t notice this   the sound system is excellent   other controls are easy to reach   though the horn needs to be a little more sensitive   outside mirrors are adequate   though they seem a bit chintzy   they do the job   but that s all   the cabin is a bit noisy during acceleration   but about what you d expect for a subcompact with a bigger than normal engine in it   cornering in normal driving is good   but sharp cornering is not quite what it should be     
1348,1,  ok   anyone who is looking for a car under    that is a coupe   should take a look at the escort zx   this car has a lot to offer including exceptional power   a hp ztech engine   the automatic will cost more   but i think it is funner to drive   lets hope that dosent discontinue this nice car it has improved so much over the years   i had a mercury tracer before and i loved it   i love my zx more though   i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality made car thank you ok   anyone who is looking for a car under    that is a coupe   should take a look at the escort zx   this car has a lot to offer including exceptional power   a hp ztech engine   the automatic will cost more   but i think it is funner to drive   lets hope that dosent discontinue this nice car it has improved so much over the years   i had a mercury tracer before and i loved it   i love my zx more though   i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality made car thank you   
1349,1,  we just bought a explorer and got rid of our old escort and then kept our camry had   miles on it while the escort had only   what a mistake that was   the camry pooped out on us now don t get me wrong the camry was a great little car well mid sized car but it had a lot of miles and needed a new trans   and the engine was soon to come we decided instead of getting all that replaced we would just get a new car we decided on another escort we needed something to balance everything out so to speak we have a big gas guzzling roomy dependible explorer   now we needed a not so roomy   fuel efficient just as dependible car we had had great luck with the old escort and we decided once again to get one this one would be a sedan lx with a standard trans it proved to be a great little car   the explorer is our vacation daily driver   the escort is our around town daily driver   the biggest problem is that it is a little underpowered   no pick up at all another one is the seats are not very comfy and it is cramped front and back we have had no troubles at all with this car if you are looking for a fuel efficient very dependible car the escort is for you br br  
1350,1,  i bought the   lx in november of    i was looking for a dependable small car with a reasonable price   i have not been disappointed with the car itself   i have    mile and it runs like a dream   i took a trip from south dakota to mississippi this summer    miles   and was very comfortable the entire trip   the car is great   however   the service has not been so great after purchasing i noticed a flaw in the window molding   i reported to when they did the customer satisfaction phone call   i was told to take to my local dealer where i had purchased the car   i was told they would fix it but could not right now   i have called a few times to see when it would be fixed and have been given no time that it can be taken care of   i am a easy person to deal with but the noise from the window may change that pretty soon   the escort is a good car for average size people i would not recommend this car for larger people   my wife is    quot   and loves the way it handles and that she can see over the steering wheel   i will purchase another in the future if the follow up service is improved     
1351,1,  i purchased a   escort se in september   i had a escort years ago   got good mileage and very few repairs so i decided i wanted another one   this car is comfortable   gets good gas mileage   sporty   amp   attractive   i like the cruise control something i never had on a car   the rear defrost is a must and of course   air conditioning   it has an excellent heater   i love the color red the car really stands out   it has plenty of leg room and it is a perfect buy for me   i think anyone would enjoy driving this car especially students and retired people   it is economical and yet attractive   so far i haven t found anything i don t like about this car   anyone who is used to a lincoln probably wouldn t be suitable for this car   i purchased the   door which has a reclining back seat which makes it nice for hauling mostly anything within reason   i would buy this vehicle again   ruth anna rote   
1352,1,  in june of    my   mercury tracer finally kicked the bucket   that was a two door coupe which was basically a big   red   problem   so off i went   carshopping with my father   i trust his opinion   and knew he d help me choose a good car    besides   i had learned the hard way that car salesmen ignore solitary women i shopped alone   read   consumer reports   faithfully and followed their reliability charts on used cars   i noted that the escort s reliability had improved drastically over the past ten years   i began looking toward an escort being an economical solution to my dilemma   and then   tired of being ignored and treated like a   stupid woman   by salesmen   i asked my dad to go with me we chose the   escort se   in silver   and i can not say enough good things about it   i adore it   my son   who is    still refers to it as   mommy s new car   even though i ve had it for nearly seven months now   the four door escort is a practical family car   for me with just one child   which gets excellent gas mileage   i have had no major problems with it   and no costs except gas and oil changes   oh   wait   i did have   one   cost   i had one flat tire   due to the fact that there is always construction going on   and almost always near someplace i need to be   i have only had one minor problem with the tape player   yes   i said tape player   the car was   and still is   under factory warranty   so off i went back to the dealers   to get it fixed   and i was an even happier camper the only drawback to the escort lies not with the car   but with me   i am not used to owning a car as new as this one   so i am sure the salesman who helped me as well as the automotive department is probably tired of seeing me   every little noise   and back i went   i was fearful of something major going wrong   as it had with my tracer   nothing is wrong with the car   i was   and still am   a paranoid new car owner  
1353,1,  i owned an escort several years ago   and i didn t care for it mainly because of a bad   speed transmission   but now   with the new escort   it s like a totally different car   i considered this car   at first   mostly because of the price   i purchased this new escort a couple months ago i already have    miles on it   and it is the best compact i have ever had   the engine is quite fast and the features for the price are out of this world   i have air   automatic   power locks   power doors   power mirrors   rear defrost   car alarm   etc   it is the best equipped car for the price   i checked out a saturn   cavalier   honda civic   hyundi   neon   etc   and nothing came with the features and a better price   it has a smooth shifting transmission and the handling is top notch   the only shortcomings are stiff seats go for the extra comfort seats otherwise   i have no complaints   if you need a small car and you are on a budget   you can not beat this car   it is also well reviewed by other consumer mags   so ask around and you will see that everyone loves this little car   was actually going to discontinue the escort   but with the new design   it has been a huge success and they are keeping it   buy it now br br  
1354,1,  you heard it from coach back in high school   your golf or tennis pro says it today   you hear the same thing from your kid s martial arts instructor    you can t reach your full potential without being tested by competition   a case in point   for twenty five years   s f   has been the undisputed king of the road   outselling every competing light truck on the road   for eighteen of those years   the f   outsold every single vehicle on the road   passenger cars and suvs included   but perhaps became a bit complacent   for    after its   update   the f   slowly lost ground to gm s silverado twins and the ram   updates to those two    for the silverado    for the ram   further encroached on the f   s lead   but the biggest scare for dearborn came in    when toyota morphed its undersized t into a true full sized truck   the tundra   combining the nearly legendary reliability of toyota s truck line with a full size truck was certain to take a bite out of s sales    and slip they did   adding more fear and loathing is the promise of another japanese full size entry    the nissan titan   promised for this model year   couldn t help but hear ever louder footsteps fortunately for the folks at the blue oval   a rebuild from wheels to the tip of the antenna was in the cards for the   model year   and    faced with slipping sales of s    rushed the redesigned f   into production   the first models rolled out in mid summer   and are sitting on showroom floors now   the big question is    did the competition bring out the best in the f   b what was   wrong   with the f   b on the face of it   not a thing was really   wrong   with the   a href content    f   a   a vehicle that came in so many configurations and trims that the only thing they seemed to have in common was a grille shaped like a cameron diaz smile   it s that the competition   especially the tundra   had started doing things better   s   redesign of the line stuck with a clunky dual leaf spring rear suspension that   while friendly to full loads of cargo   is less kind to passengers   kidneys   then   too   saddled the   pound truck with a standard    liter v so under powered    hp   that a basic model couldn t outrun its own shadow   and when you come right down to it   eight years is a long time to go without a redesign   even for trucks   vehicles that generally have precious little wiggle room for design but change they did   the boasts that they ve touched on every system in the vehicle in an effort to make the   redesign total    and from where i sit   it looks like they have   but again we must ask    did they do the job   let s look and see b first   let s talk choices   truth be told   the f   comes in so darned many configurations that it s easier to describe with a set of matrices than it is to list   em all   but i can t draw a matrix here   so let me break it down this way i drive train i   wd or wd i trim levels i   five   from the base xl   stx   xlt   fx   and lariat i cab configurations i   three   regular   not available in lariat trim   supercab   and supercrew   not available in xl and stx i bed length i   three       not available on regular cab       not available on supercrew   and     not available on supercrew i body style i   two   flareside and styleside   availability dependent on both cab configuration and bed length whew   i think that makes forty seven different combinations   but i lost count somewhere in the bed lengths   those are just the basics    of course offers the truck in eleven different colors and with two different standard engines and two transmissions   you can also purchase special towing packages   including an obstacle sensing   radar   system for the rear   and a snow plow package for your x   this vehicle is in no way a purchase for the decision challenged person   me   i just took the first truck i happened upon in the dealer s lot   an stx wd supercab with the standard   l engine and a couple of options   cruise control and the towing package   for those of you keeping track   it was black with a gray   technically    medium flint   interior b looks count for something   face it   a truck is a truck is a truck   from the outside   at least   a pickup is just a naked box on wheels with a bit of covered space where a driver can sit   except for the badging and taillight shapes   pickups are fairly hard to tell apart in silhouette    though from the front   the grille shape quickly gives   em away   still   has managed to apply some cosmetic changes to the previous version   resulting in a model that s distinguishable even to one who s not a enthusiast compared to the previous model   a walkaround will show that has dumped the raked   streamlined shape of the front end that was so reminiscent of early taurus models   instead   they ve essentially recreated the body style of the f   s beefier siblings   the f   and f    up front the headlights are more squared   and that grinning grille takes a bite out of the leading edge of the hood   in fact   the hood now   includes   the grille   which may come as a painful surprise for tall owners the first few times they check their crankcase oil   stroll down the length of the body   and you ll note that all f s now have a notched front window like the big guys   and the door handles aren t the old ovals but beefy looking square pads with wraparound handles   further back   flares on the rear fenders have a flat strip integrated at their outer edge instead of the smooth curve of last year s f    this latter is very noticeable on the flareside   which is pretty much the same idea as chevy s stepside bed   naturally   the tail end has undergone a little change   too    mostly in the shape of the taillights   they re slightly shorter and wider than in the previous design   and the hideous teardrop shaped lenses on the flareside have been dropped in favor of the same light housings used on the styleside   btw   while i once called the flareside s taillights the ugliest ever mounted on a pickup truck   that was before i saw the lights on a tundra   stepside   all tailgates are removable and locking   and i found them surprisingly light for a hunk of metal that large   this may be the   tailgate assist   feature   which no salesman could explain   by the way   the cargo boxes are now two inches deeper than before    the side rails are a whopping   inches off the ground now   go back toward the front and open the doors   and keep opening doors   in a definite coup for   every last f    regardless of cab configuration or trim level   has four doors   even a regular cab boasts a pair of skinny rearward opening doors for improved access to the enlarged cubby behind the front seat s   did do the job   yes to the four doors   no to the body   redesign    cheaters b notes from the interior   lavished more attention to the interior of the f    with as much landscape as is available there    what   an acre or two   they had plenty of room to play   all basic amenities are present   standard ac   dash mounted cupholders   with more in the flip down console for bench seats   a pair of power points   one on the passenger side of the dash   and a surprisingly puny glove compartment   map pockets are incised into all doors   with integrated cutouts in the front doors for bottle holders   where seems to have paid the most attention is not in design   although it s certainly changed   but in materials   while lower end models   like the   stx sport i drove last month   were once slathered with cheesy looking plastics   the materials in the   have a more solid look   they feel solid   too   and the model i drove had even better build quality than that     already good power windows in both the front and rear   for supercrew and supercab   are standard in xlt   fx   and lariat trims but in the xl and stx trims the rear windows are fixed   they don t even tilt out   the cab s rear window can be ordered as a slider in any cab and trim   a powered slider is optional in the top three xlt   fx   and lariat trims offer a nifty optional   overhead rail   system that lets ceiling mounted storage and a v goodies move front to back   it s unavailable on the xl or my stx   the rails   which include transmission of power for a dvd screen or speaker and climate controls   are finished in brushed aluminum    they re incompatible   however   with the optional power moonroof did do the job   no question about it   yes b driving interface   oh   yeah   the cab   is   about an acre in area    large enough that for average sized me   reaching some controls even in the center of the dashboard was a bit of a stretch   if a potential driver is on the short side   you may wish to spring for the optional power adjustable pedal cluster   standard on lariat   all trims and cabs have tilt steering   an instrument panel with speedometer    odometer    fuel    voltmeter    temperature gauges   and manual lumbar support   the breakover point for cushiness appears to be between the stx and the xlt   the upper three trims have a standard tach   power front and rear windows   and cruise control   the two lower trims have optional cruise control climbing into the cab is made a bit easier by a pair of grab handles   though i found them located awkwardly far to the front   once seated high above the madding crowd in the cab   you ll find that for the most part the instrument panel is well laid out and intuitive   i found the standard bench seat a bit deep   and it could use a little more contouring to the average posterior shape   as it s rather flat   the large steering wheel makes reaching left hand controls and the ignition a little tough   occluding both wiper and light controls   the sound system controls are high on the dash   keep your eyes on the road   bud   and seem marginally larger than those of the previous year   climate control knobs and buttons face directly rearward at the center of the dashboard   potentially a stretch for short armed drivers   unless you spring for the pricey captain s chairs and floor mounted shifter   the column mounted shifter makes access to the ignition a bit awkward   buttons for the optional cruise control are on the face of the steering wheel   always a plus in my book the white on black instrument panel is clear and easy to read   note that lariat trims have a ritzier black on offwhite look   besides the gauges   there s also a set of idiot lights for all the usual warnings   lariat drivers will find one of those ultra cool   and occasionally distracting   information centers with readouts of time   distance   fuel economy   etc   tucked beneath the voltmeter and oil pressure gauge did do the job   ummm   not really    it s pretty much the same layout and interface as the    with a continuation of reach and access problems   especially for smaller drivers b time for the driving experience   must ve listened to me last time around    they ve dumped the underpowered v engine that was standard in the last model run   rumors say it will return next year   but i ll bet it s no longer a wimpy   hp   mind you   they haven t offered a   new   standard engine   just dropped the little one   now standard is the   l triton sohc v that was optional last year   which generates   hp and   lb ft of torque   last year s   l v has undergone a major workover   bulking up to   hp and   lb ft   much of the work on this engine    introducing variable valve timing and three valves per cylinder    was intended to boost both power and torque low in the rpm range   claims that the engine delivers over   lb ft of torque at   rpm   just barely above an idle   comparison of last year s model specs with this year s   though   shows that the s are are about a five inches longer and    pounds heavier across the board   which tends to dampen my enthusiasm for any increases in power manual transmissions went the way of the v engine   no word on whether they ll return   for    bought out a new   speed electronic overdrive automatic   the only tranny available   errr   excuse me     but how come you haven t been able to come up with a   speed   i thought you were working on   innnovation but the proof is in the driving   and to tell the truth   it s bit tough to tell that anything s been updated in some arenas   acceleration isn t particularly impressive   try comparing it to a similar sized suv   like the   a href content   chevy suburban a   although it s admittedly better than the sluggish v   handling is somewhat improved   though still decidedly truck like   although brags that they refined the rear suspension    mostly by mounting the rear shocks outboard of the leaf springs and stiffening the frame rails    the truck still has a jittery ride and lots of side to side motion when empty   ride quality will most certainly increase when some payload is added   however   as is normal for pickups   steering has been improved by introduction of a power rack and pinion system   in a departure from previous steering   the driver maintains a good   road feel   even through the power steering system   and that certainly helps   for a truck this size   minimum length    maximum    handling is relatively sprightly    but beware the huge turning radius when it s time for parking   handling is better for this vehicle than others i ve driven in its class   although i m waiting to get my hands on a   tundra and have yet to drive the latest version of the ram   i ll let you know   still and all   the ride is certainly an improvement over the punishing   kidney bashing ride of even ten years ago   looks like the influx of drugstore cowboys seeking that   cool   pickup truck look has had an upside after all   sound wise   this f is about the same as last year s   minor engine noise and low to moderate wind and road noise did do the job   a qualified   maybe   they dumped the wimpy v and improved the suspension and steering    but i m unvconvinced that the improvement is enough to leapfrog the competition   i also miss manual trannies b safety   all f s come with two dual stage front airbags   a passenger side deactivation switch is provided for regular cabs   front seatbelts   which are integrated into the body of the seat   are equipped with pretensioners and an energy management system   all outboard seating positions have three point harnesses as does the rear center position in supercrews and supercabs latch points are standard all configurations have standard four wheel disc brakes with abs   and side intrusion door beams side airbags are not available even as an option   neither is a side curtain system   this is troubling   since certainly knows how to install them in their other vehicles   including the excursion and an optional canopy system offered in the a href content   expedition a   go figure did do the job   no   where are the side airbags   the traction control    line at the bottom   to sum up   has indeed touched on every major system in the new f    frame   suspension   transmission   engine   they cheated a bit there   and interior and exterior design   where they ve done best is in the cosmetics   especially the amount of attention lavished on the interior and in the across the board inclusion of four doors on the cab   they were smart to drop the v   but   i think   dumb to drop the manual tranny   the updated automatic transmission may be an improvement but it s not particularly noticeable   a couple of points stand out in my overview of the model update   first   how come can t seem to come up with a broader range of powertrain options   only two engines and one transmission is about what they offer in their bottom of the line compacts   and second   why do they steadfastly refuse to even offer optional side airbags or a canopy system   we know thay have one from their suvs   it s my feeling that just didn t quite leap far enough forward with the update   sure   they ve stayed ahead of or even with the gmc and offerings   but those footsteps with a japanese accent are sounding just as loud as before   i m gon na say that the improvement wasn t enough to bring the f   up to five stars   i ll let you know for sure after i ve finished testing a new tundra   but right now   i m not overly impressed by the model change   at the moment s are selling at     discounts   and you ll get a darned good truck for that price   hurry   though    cause the selections are dwindling  
1355,1,  way before i got interested into writing about cars   the f series has been america s best selling truck   it s been like that for more than   years   in fact   many industry insiders will admit that the f series has saved when it hits hard times   it goes without saying that on our local freeways and highways   you will find an f   truck out of every   truck   i had never given much attention to the truck until i started spending more time on a friend s farm   it appears that all his father s trucks have been a f   over the years   what i have found to be the enduring values of this great vehicle are its practicality and strength   this year   the   sounds quieter and more refined thanks to a   part noise   vibration and harshness upgrade   from what i can remember   the   f   supercrew drives so much better than its predecessors   it appears that can only continue to improve its well known crown jewels   this is a truck that has withstood times and economic hardships   it continues to deliver power and durability in the line of full size pickups   based on the   f series   i just can t wait to test drive the   f series which has caused so much hoopla so far there are three trim series that are available on the supercab models xl   xlt and lariat   it offers so much comfort and cargo carrying capacity that most buyers end up comparing it with its main competitors on the market   it makes sense that they end up purchasing this truck for the type of package and value    taking a look at its interior   some of the features that you will find on this truck include the following   standard power adjustable pedals   power moonroof and a functional bed extender in case you want to increase the box length for carrying longer items   this truck has come handy on the farm   many construction workers purchase them too   it s great to carry cargo   other features include   air conditioning   overhead console   power windows with delayed accessory power and one touch down driver s window   power locks   tilt steering wheel   speed control and power moonroof   electronic automatic temperature control is standard on the truck to help secure your cargo   tie down hooks are located in each corner of all f   cargo boxes   in addition   you will find out that the cargo light on the back of the cab makes loading and unloading the truck box very easy at night   designs this truck with the owner user in mind   to provide you with comfort   the designers place a rear step bumper that gives easy access to the cargo area   the tailgate can be removed for special loading duties b how about the truck s powertrain b f   supercab    liter ohv v   engine produces   horsepower and   foot pounds of torque   the split port induction system tends to optimize fuel efficiency and engine response   no wonder that i had a ball when test driving and working with this truck on the farm   very few trucks are that responsive when you need them to   it comes with a four speed automatic overdrive transmission   that s an option that the owner wanted   with so many packages that are available out there on these trucks   you can have anything that you want as long as you can afford it   this is true in the case of the towing and payload ratings of the f   tester    with all those statistics   how did i feel driving the truck b i ride   handling   safety and security issues   fyi   all f   trucks come equipped with a four wheel anti lock braking system   that s standard   the short and long arm independent fron suspension enhances my ride and handling   all in all   it was quite a smooth ride   i was amazed by its handling   for the driver and passenger   the truck is equipped with air bag supplemental restraint system   there is also the side door intrusion beams that help protect passengers or occupants in the case of a side door impact or accident   countless lives may have been saved thanks to this upgrade   latch child safety seat tethers are standard equipment on the f   trucks   also   belt minder system encourages safety belt use   this way   you won t have to drive long and short distances without putting on your belts   remote keyless entry offers added convenience and security at night by activating the interior lights   how handy this features has come especially when you have to park away from the lighted parking lot   in the fields of california   we sometimes have to leave our trucks for very long periods of time b final thoughts   the   series can only get better   the wants to innovate with the   pickup too   if you have not gotten a   you can wait for the   truck   i don t necessarily trust other vehicles   but after working with the f series   i would invite anybody to give it a try    why should you buy the   a href content    toyota sienna a   find out more  
1356,1,  ok so maybe econoline vans aren t for everyone   especially if you live in the city   if you aren t someone that lives in the city and you like to drive long distances on vacations then this vehicle is for you what s the interior of the econoline like well one way to explain this question is by comparing the interior of an econoline to that of an airplane that is first class   the seats are very comfortable   and my particular model is equipped with gadgets galore   a plug in vacuum   a tv and vcp   a mechanical bed that turns into a back seat   a   disc cd changer   and much more   with power ac a ride to my grandparents house in florida is very comfortable what s the mile per gallon on the econoline although i am very seldom a driver of my econoline since my parents do most of the driving i do know that the econoline gets better miles to the gallon then that of a jeep grand cherokee   note   this may not be accurate for all types of cherokees   the only reason i say this fact is because i recall my mother and my uncle comparing gas mileage prices   and the econoline was better then the jeep how is the handling of an econoline although i very seldom use the econoline for my personal driving the few times i ve used it i noticed that it is a difficult vehicle to manuever in tight situations   this is due to the size of the vehicle rather then the steering   the steering is very good   the only difficulty with the handling is getting used to the size of the vehicle why should someone buy one these like i said earlier the econoline is not for everyone   if you are however one who likes the travel   then this is the perfect car for your needs   with good miles to the gallon   and an extremely good ride   it is well worth the money br br  
1357,1,  last year   we decided to trade our family car for a sports car   we already had a chevy lumina   so we decided it was time to get rid of the unreliable grand am and go to a sporty car   we shopped around before deciding on what car to purchase   we test drove a mitsubishi eclipse   chevy monte carlo   mazda rx    probe and eagle talon   all the ones that we test drove were around the same year and handled relatively the same we went out of town to a car dealer to look and test drive more models   at the third dealer we came to   we told the sales person what we were looking for and the price range and he immediately directed us to a lonely     just waiting to be brought home by some lucky person   without delay   we test drove this car   this is a   lx v automatic with power windows   power door locks   cd stereo system   dual air bags and power driver s seat   while looking this car over   we discovered that it only had    original miles on the odometer   we checked everything on the car   inside and out   and we decided to purchase   we got it for a steal at     after having the car for almost a year   i still love it as much as the day we bought it   well   that is a little exaggerated because we have had a few small problems   but overall it is still great the engine in my     is a little short on power   but it will do for me   it does get good gas mileage   if i keep my foot out of it   in curves   i really do not like the way it handles   i had a saturn   door coupe that would whip it in curves as far as handling goes   but this car cruises the highway very comfortably the fit and finish on my is great   everything lines up and looks good   however   the dash and all the plastic molding on the inside do rattle and squeak but i will deal with this little annoyance because i love the car so much   the mounting pads in the strut tower tend to squeak really bad on bumps   obviously all   mustangs   are like this because my husband had an    model that done the same thing   we have done routine maintenance on the car and that has kept this stang in great working order   my hubby loves this car because it is one of the few that is still rear wheel drive   he likes the fact that the engine is sitting in the car the way it should be   in other words   he can work on the car easily the only major problem that we have experienced with the car is the check engine light coming on   the flap in the gas tank sticking open and not building up enough fuel pressure caused this   once we took it to a dealer and had the problem corrected   we have not had any more problems but i will admit   it is not great for when kids are involved   a rear facing car seat will not fit into the small back seat   i now use a front facing car seat and do not have any problems   even though we have experienced a few minor problems   i would still highly recommend the     to anyone wanting a good cruising car   the car is not only reliable   but is very sexy   it has a muscular stance and does not look like a catfish coming down the road like the chevy camaro   i am not knocking the camaro because it is a great car too   but mine just looks better   lol   
1358,1,  if you are looking for a new car   for sure go with the   i ve had my    cherry red for a little over    years now and it s the best car i have ever owned   it gets great gas mileage   high speed   and of course it looks awesome   only thing is   this is not a family car   the front seats give you plenty of leg room and you can be very comfortable   but   i must say the back seat area must of been designed for kids only   it s rather small and crampy   if you have young children who still use car seats this   is most likely not the car for you   i ve tried numerous times to fit a carseat in the backseat and still have the passenger in my car comfortable with enough room   needless to say it never worked out   what i love about this car   is that i have had basically no problems with it whatsoever   never had to take it to the shop   new tires put on   nothing   it s a very high quality car   the car drives like a dream   i highly suggest it for anyone   insurance can be a real pain in the rear end though   owning a means outrageous insurance people   but   it s well worth every penny of it br br  
1359,1,  i bought my gt   year ago   it was a low mile   v   convertible   i absolutely love it   a very fun car   the styling is great    better than the    s and k s   and much nicer than the earlier boxy style   the fit and finish is fine   it did have some acid rain damage from the previous owner   a trip to the body shop and    later solved    of the problem   the car is black   and i am very fussy   it s a bit noisy with the top up while on the highway   but heck   it s a convertible   the leather seats are very comfortable   i love getting into it   the   l engine and   speed transmission are super   plenty of power   nice sounding stock   dual exhaust   i use the car mostly on weekends    as a fun car   it will be stored for the winter   this car will never see snow   ice and salt   a friend has a bmw   series convertible   sorry   dollar for dollar   no comparison to my pony   the bmw is a high tech   high priced   sterile car   the is an all american muscle car   i could see buying a   cylinder coupe as a family or second car   although rear wheel traction would be a problem in winter     
1360,1,  as my th birthday rolled around   the dream of owning a hot set of wheels became more prominent in my blonde little head   i knew nothing about cars   engines   etc   but i did know that i loved the color purple   this   v that sat at a local dealer was very much purple   and is now very much mine   my boyfriend   who is a die hard chevy man   warned me about the car   but now has grown to love it almost as much as me as far as power goes   the v is all i will ever need   although it may be a little sluggish for some power hungry people   i adore the color   a bright vibrant purple that i can only find in    stangs   and i think the light grey interior is tasteful   the power locks   windows   and seats are a luxury that i have grown to appreciate   the front seats are very comfortable and with being only     tall   the power up button on the seats makes driving very comfortable   however   as for any sports car the backseat is perfect for holding my backpack   shopping bags   and purse but not my friends   the gas cap can be slightly awkward as i recall being at a filling station   minutes away from home   the needle on   e   bawling to my boyfriend on my cell phone that i couldn t figure it out   once i got the hang of it   there hasn t been any problems since   speaking of gas   it gets around   mpg when i drive it in town and about   mpg when my bf drives it    although   i ve been told that mustangs are   a dime a dozen   i take pride in the fact that i drive a new model of an original classic car   i also take pride in the stares i receive when i drive down the road   i also like the fact that aftermarket parts are so easy to find   so fixing one up is a breeze all in all   i suggest this car for anyone who doesn t have children   usually drives alone   and wants a good looking car  
1361,1,  i am originally from nyc   no one there drive as pickup primary car   the explorer sport trac breaks all the rule and whenever   i drive my ride home people stop and ask me so many questions about this good looking ride   never in a million years did i think i would ever be caught in a pickup   not only that you think parrallel parking would be difficult   especially in nyc   i have put this baby in some spaces   went way out on this ride by combining the comfort of the suv explorer and f truck to come up with a ride both woman and men could take pleasure   the sport trac definitely makes a statement about ones personality and a taste this four door pickup truck easily accommodates four   ft men   fully powered even the automatic rear window is great feature   the sound system alone blows most cars off the road   equipped with not only standard speakers   this ride roars with bottom   bass   just like a night club   with all the windows rolled up and volume at set at half sounds heard outside the car are crystal clear long distance driving is a breeze   comfortable and great on gas   switch   to   wheel drive   high or low in a breeze   air conditioning is great   i spent tow in in charleston   sc and it get hot down there   the best part is the bed   this sure comes in handy   of course it is larger than a car trunk put smaller than a standard size bed   however   you can fit most anything in there i purchased this vehicle last october   for my birthday and what i love most is this is simply a great looking all around multi purpose truck that i am proud to take anywhere whether it to the supermarket or waiting valet attendant   this suv mpv pick up truck turns heads and burns rubber when i have to  
1362,1,  with all the hype about the   focus   you d think that was giving away rocketships   is the   focus a well equipped   comfortable economy car   absolutely   is it the dawning of a new era of euro styled   ergonomically attuned   new edge globally conceived econovehicles   or whatever the marketing gobbledegook says   uh   i dunno   that part is a little over my head   but it sounds overstated   it s just a car   but it s a good car b mission affordable b i wanted to purchase a new car for my sister for her birthday   i m no millionaire   and her needs are simple   she doesn t drag race   nor does she haul a horse trailer   transport scout troops   or need to make a socioeconomic statement with her vehicle   she just needs to commute to work and get to wherever else she needs to go   it would be nice if her butt didn t go numb and if she didn t explode into flames in the process   in the past   my family has had a host of american label economy cars   and i admit that that s what i m partial to   i looked at a number of comparable cars   cavalier   plymouth neon   saturn s series   escort   etc   i had never even heard of a focus until i began researching new cars   and i certainly hadn t seen one   but in the end   that s what i ended up with   my sister is happy   i m happy   i d do it again   i d recommend this car to others b bang for the buck b so   what does     get you these days   the standard   focus se sedan costs     msrp     invoice   one can visit s official website   fordvehicles   for all the specifics   but this includes such standard features as   dual air bags   air conditioning   am fm radio with cassette   power locks and mirrors   remote keyless entry    quot securilock quot   passive anti theft system   panic alarm    hour roadside assistance    quot   wheels     split fold rear seat   manual seat height adjuster   vanity mirrors on both visors   interior trunk release latches    year    mile bumper to bumper warranty the options i selected are as follows upgraded   quot zetec quot   engine      msrp    invoice automatic transmission      msrp    invoice comfort group   arm rest with storage   tilt telescoping steering wheel   cruise control   map lights      msrp    invoice front and rear floor mats      msrp    invoice power windows      msrp    invoice anti lock brakes      msrp    invoice the destination fee is     and the manufacturer determined advertising fee is     these two fees are supposed to be non negotiable   adding all this up gives a figure ranging from      msrp figures   to      invoice figures   this makes the   focus se sedan an affordable car   but not the least expensive car that one could possibly purchase   i will echo what everyone else has said   for the money   this car offers a lot of features and feels like a more expensive vehicle   also very relevant to me   since i wanted to finance this car   is credit s attractive financing rate   in my area   the best credit union offered a    apr on   year auto loans   currently   offers     for the same loan      for   year loans   and     for   year loans   this is another area where one can save a few dollars with this vehicle b form embodies function b either you think that the   focus is attractive   or you don t   there s not much middle ground   the se sedan looks very similar to a volkswagon jetta with ugly and unmistakable triangular headlights   it took me a while to learn to accept the headlights   i admit   the car is tall and blunt not unlike a toyota echo with a hood that arcs sharply downward and a rump that seems a bit elevated   it s not to everyone s taste   to be sure   several professional writers have called the sedan   quot boring quot   but i think that it is an appealing car   i think that the focus hatchback is an eyesore   however   to each his own   frankly   i don t select a car based strictly on aesthetics the shape of the car is functional   to be sure   because it is tall for its size   it gives the illusion of being a larger car   seats are set high enough that one doesn t feel like their   quot knees are bumping the handlebars quot   when seated   it has accurately been described as chairlike or mini van suv like inside   legs hang comfortably   and one views the road from a taller vantage   you don t feel vulnerable in this car like you might in some other small car   it is easy to get in and out of   because the seats are rump level   i found that the back seat is especially comfortable in this regard   similarly   the elevated height makes it easy to access the trunk without a lot of bending and stretching    what i like about this car b roominess   as discussed above   the car feels a lot bigger than it is   in addition to head and leg room   the trunk is cavernous   both back seats can be folded to offer even more cargo area   i expect a small car to feel small   so the roomy feel to this small car is a really nice surprise   comfort   no question about it   this is a very comfortable car for its class   the fabric seats are well cushioned and supportive   the suspension absorbs irregularities in the road very effectively   my neighborhood is rotten with potholes and road construction at the moment   and yet i barely feel any lumps and bumps in this car   even though it s a small car   i could travel a distance in it with ease   the back is sufficiently spacious for two passengers   especially kids adjustable driver s seat   related to the above is the driver s seat itself   it is adjustable in three different ways   the back of the seat can recline as much as you need it to   the seat can be pulled closer to or further away from the steering wheel   and the seat can be raised and lowered   i love the latter feature   some writers have complained about the simple crank mechanism that raises or lowers the seat   but i consider it refreshing to have a non electronic means to adjust the seat   the fact that i can do it at all is wonderful   but the fact that it didn t cost me a small fortune as an option is even better   this is particularly important because my sister and i differ in height by six or seven inches adjustable steering wheel   if adjusting the seat isn t enough   the steering wheel can be adjusted up down or in out with the tilt telescoping properties   whether someone is short or tall   small or large   i believe that they d be able to make the necessary adjustments to be totally comfortable in this car handling   this car is really a pleasure to drive   the small diameter steering wheel has comfortable swollen grips on it   and the steering is accurate and easy   braking is similarly responsive   in spite of some of the literature that suggests that the car is underpowered   my experience is that it is very zippy   put simply   it starts   stops   and turns very comfortably and easily   it feels very secure on the road   never light or tippy or weak   not bad for a car that only weighs    pounds   i can only imagine that anyone displeased with the handling is comparing it to something out of its class   perhaps a larger luxury car or racy sportscar   peace and quiet   the focus is smooth handling and surprisingly quiet in certain respects   turn signals quietly tock tock tock   the hydraulically opening trunk is shockingly quiet   as are the doors    by contrast   i jump a foot in the air when the doors automatically lock as i drive away   that s loud   again   in spite of reports to the contrary   i have not found that the engine is excessively noisy   you hear it rev when you accelerate   but it s never loud enough to interfere with conversation   my friend s saturn has a much louder engine silly little things   the storage slots on the inside of the front doors for holding maps and such are really wide   you can easily fit a novel instead of just a magazine in these slots   one of the things i like best about that is that it makes them easy to vacuum clean the radio faceplate can be removed easily so that the radio is rendered functionless if it s stolen   i don t know who would steal the factory radio out of an economy car   nor do i know who would worry about it getting stolen   but hey   it s one of those fun things to show your friends   worth noting   the radio allows you to preset   am and   fm stations   if you have a lot of favorite radio stations   that s a nice feature   there s a pen holder next to the driver s seat   the glove box is huge   you could fit a taco bell dog in there   along with your owner s manual   the aspca advises against this   however the owner s manual comes in a nice little zippered storage case that looks sophisticated   there are special hooks in the back seat to attach car seats for little ones   i don t have kids   but if i did   that would be a big plus   there are two great big cupholders in front with removable liners that can be easily cleaned b gripes b visibility   this is the biggest drawback to the focus   with a hood that arcs sharply downward   it is virtually impossible to see the front of the car   you get a feel for where it is   but i d hate to have to parallel park this thing   it s not a car for tailgaters or big city parking for that reason   similarly   the car s rump is elevated   so it s difficult to see where you re going when you back up   the big   obtrusive   front headrests and car frame itself further impede visibility rearward   the side mirrors compensate for this   however illogical controls   most of the controls are clearly labelled   and for the most part i have no complaint   but some of it seems senseless to me   the hazard light switch is the single most prominent feature on the dashboard   it s a huge orange triangle that begs to be pushed   i m in my thirties   and i ve never had the need to turn on the hazard lights in any car i ve driven   even when the switch is less obvious   i ve always known where it was   but i ve never needed to use it   why on earth is it so prominent in this vehicle   what is trying to tell me   by contrast   the am fm switch on the radio is microscopic and situated way to the right side of the radio   i ve learned where it is   but i still have to take my eyes off of the road to find it   am i the only person who finds this irritating windshield wiper controls   the turn signal control is on the left side of the steering wheel   in most cars i ve driven   the windshield wipers are located on the same stalk   not in this car   the windshield wiper control is a separate stalk on the right side of the steering wheel   why   this particular departure from convention annoys me fuel gauge   it annoys me that i can t read the fuel level without turning the car on   similarly   the odometer is an led panel that doesn t appear unless the car is on   i m not sure what the point of this is   other than to look fancy   but i suspect that with age   if either of these things got quirky   it would be expensive to fix them   rear floor mats   um   these things look like furry business envelopes   they re tiny   i believe that floor mats have become standard on the   focus   i certainly wouldn t pay extra for the rear ones marketing   i have simple tastes   so i find a lot of the marketing for this car to be incredibly annoying   the brochure for this car is ugly and contains almost no information   although the target market is young   ish ish   women   the sales pitch is gimmicky and yuppified in tone with lots of irritating buzzwords bandied about   anybody who uses the term ergonomic should be run over with a hummer   ironically   all the hype stresses how   quot european quot   this car is   i ve always owned american cars   i like american cars   don t tell me that my michigan built is european   dammit   it s a turn off    the unknown b reliability   nobody knows   plain and simple   i purchase a car with the intention of putting     miles on it and keeping it for ten years or more   i hope this car carries me there   in any case   i ll update this as needed to reflect my gripes and concerns b warnings b if you order your focus   be aware that they take forever to arrive   i was promised mine in    weeks   and it showed up   weeks later   judging by what other people say   the average wait is about   weeks   also   keep in mind that some people have had problems with these cars   take a look at the   quot town hall quot   at edmunds   edmunds   and or the message board at club focus   discussion board clubfocus   to see what others have had to say    bottom line b be clear about what you want in a car   if you want an economy car that is comfortable and well equipped   at least consider a   focus   do your homework at edmunds   edmunds   and other online sites   take a look   go for a test drive   my sister used to be a firm hater   but she loves this car   if i had it to do over   i d buy it again   hopefully it will stand the test of time     
1363,1,   what a pleasant surprise to have build an affordable   cool   well sorted domestic pocket rocket and then to have so many bolt on performance parts available after only a year b to start out with the zx has a racing history in the fia world rally championship   wrc   drivers colin mcrae and carlos sainz are trying to capture the manufacturers title this year   anyway   your zx likely did not get the rally option with the   hp   but you ll be pleased to learn that you can come real close to that with some carefully chosen bolt on goodies    disclaimer   these upgrades may invalidate your warranty    do your homework before modifying your new car b     start with a k amp n air filter if you want to keep a stealth stock look   or you could opt for one of the umpteen gazillion cold air induction kits     next you ll want an aftermarket exhaust to let everything breate a little easier   the one from focussport has a great exhaust note and is relatively easy to put on   you will have to cut the stock exhaust off   however     next go for an underdrive pulley which will free up a few horsepower    a performance chip is always an easy way to increase power    sometimes by as much as   hp     if you re really serious about more horsepower there are actually turbo kits available as well     think about some nice cosmetic goodies also    a duck tail rally car style wing    check out   focaljet   for group buys   there are also tons of ground effects kits from west wings and others     lower the car to improve the handling and appearance    try the coil overs if you can afford it   but just a solid set of lowering springs should do fine for all but the most serious competitior   try h amp rs     wheels     some people use the   contour svt   quot   wheels   my personal favorite b   while others have used the cougar   quot   wheels   both of these fit great since the bolt pattern is shared   there are also a ton of   quot   wheels that are fairly cheap that look great like the konig monsoon the sky is the limit from there   check out the websites mentioned above for great tech articles also   what a great car and some great ways to improve it even more br br  
1364,1,  i decided to put some fun in my commute     miles a day roundtrip   when i decided to buy a new car   enter the focus zx b my first new car    main reasons to buy   i bought it because it s great handling   decent fuel economy   price and over all fun ness to drive   i know   fun ness   is very subjective but trust me    take a zx for a test drive you ll see   it was my first new car ever and i didn t want to throw my money away   i researched very carefully   i looked at the obvious in it s class ish honda   reliable but dull   toyota echo   see my other review   way too many cons   vw   too much money for not enough car   and some others   i went to each dealer armed with tons of information off the internet with stats and invoice pricing on each car   i knew exactly what each car cost the dealer at its invoice price   so   i knew what i could get for how much without paying too much over sticker   i wound up paying exactly the invoice price for my new silver zx   spd with ac and tilt wheel with navigator options b   the drive   to tell you the truth   the   spd is really zippy   it won t beat a corvette or anything on a jack rabbit stop light start   but it really cruises along best at highway speeds   i often look down at the speedometer to unknowingly be going    the zx is very easy to negotiate through all kinds of traffic   with good stopping power   and the cornering is awesome for a little   take it on a test drive   hopefully without the sales person   just so you can take those corners fast    you ll see added bonus   parking   if you live in a city where parking is at a premium   you can squeeze into those tiny spots while the envious monster suv owners have no choice but to cruise on by   n   side of chicago especially b interior   the interior is great    easy to get to everything and doesn t look feel cheap for the inexpensive amount you paid    the leather wrapped steering wheel is a nice touch   the back seat is very roomy   every time someone gets back there they always say something about how much room there is   and most of these people drive full sized cars and are used to room b added bonus   leather wrapped steering wheel fog lights cd player are all standard b   the not so great    now this is not to say the car hasn t had problems   it has   the brake pads and rotors were replaced at    miles   i am at    no probs since   and of course the re have been recalls   mine was only affected by one recall   these are actually things i can deal with   but considering my service dept where i bought the car sucks   it makes it even more difficult to deal with these problems   i expected to have some probs   did not expect the service to suck as much as it does   so   before you buy make sure you find out how good the   service   is in the service department     overall   some problems are to be expected if you want to be the first kid on the block with the cool new toy such is the case with the   focus zx the really good news is   a lot of the bugs have since been worked out with the s just because you have to buy economy doesn t mean you have to feel like you re driving an econo box   see the toyota echo b focus zx    you get a lot of car   for not a lot of money     note   why revised   because i wrote this before i knew at epinions   i simply wrote it at first   to tell everyone in the market what a great car this was   i didn t even know what epinions was   the revisions have cleared up some of the format to be more epinion friendly   thanks   revised june   update     miles in one year so far so good   warrenty will be up soon   no problems with brakes since k   but still worried about them still handles well   although gas milage seems to be dipping   i used to get about mpg   mostly highway   now i average about   mpg  
1365,1,  my sister purchased a new focus hatchback zx and i have had the chance to drive it around a ton   the weird part about it is i can t stop driving this little car   i love it   now i know that is weird to say about a   especially their affordable compact   but it s true   has put together one of   if not the best   small cars on the market   the idea behind the focus is to make a safe   reliable   and fun car that can be had in three body styles   hatchback   sedan   and wagon   i was personally expecting to build a mediocre compact similar to the escort   but they certainly outdid themselves with this car the exterior of the focus has yet to grow on me   it seems tall   oddly shaped and misproportioned   i am starting to get used to the   quot new edge quot   styling that is employing   but i am not convinced that it makes a good looking or striking car   if anything it makes the car less striking and more boring   if this car had clean   sleek lines i think would have had an even bigger winner than they have   overall   for the money   the exterior is solidly built and in it s own way sporty   the one thing about the car that sets it apart though is its shape   especially the hatchback   people always seem confused on what they think about the car when they see it   the exterior of the car is not where the beauty is   as a matter of fact the interior isn t much better   the beauty of the car starts behind the wheel   this car is more fun than anyone could imagine from looking at it   the steering is crisp   gives good feedback   and can seriously corner   you would think a car so tall would be washy on the road   but this thing can be tossed around   i was so surprised that at first i didn t believe it   i thought it was more of an illusion than reality   so i looked up the focus   statistics in car and driver and i wasn t wrong   the car puts up slalom and skidpad numbers that rival cars such as the camaro and firebird   now that is impressive for a compact that rounds out at     i felt very sure of the car s footing and felt as if i had total control of the car at all times   body roll was a little excessive   but still much better than    of american made cars   back to the interior   there s really not a lot to say   obviously   since it is a cheap car it is very basic   the ergonomics of the instruments are good   everything is in the right place and is easy to use   you also may notice the included air bags at no extra cost   a very responsible move by that i appreciate   the great part about the interior is the build quality   it is much better than the escorts poorly built interior   as a matter of fact   with a little refinement   the focus   build quality will be comparable to honda and other japanese companies now that i have ranted and raved about this car   are there any downsides you ask   yes   the engine   that is not to say it isn t sufficient   it just doesn t match the ability of the suspension system   the zetec   cylinder is zippy   but does not have the punch you need for merging into highway traffic   if they could fit the   cylinder from the contour in this car it would be an absolute blast   the other downside is the suspension can be a little stiff at times   more than it could or should be   some may also say the styling is a major problem   but i think if you get behind the wheel   the styling will be forgiven   my sister has not had the car long enough to see if it will be reliable or not   but it seems that it will be   those are the only gripes   and for a car this price   that is amazing   has put together exactly what they wanted to create   and they definitely did not forget the fun   this car could also catch on with the tuner crowd also   and if i was gon na build a boy racer   this would probably be the car i started with   it has the goods to be amazing   this is one great car br br  
1366,1,  at the age of    i found myself in the market for a commuter car when we decided to give our old one to a relative   as it had been some time until i had looked at an   entry level   car   it was with some trepidation that i approached a dealer lot to look at the focus   the last   entry   i had owned was an    mercury bobcat straight out of college   and quality was not a word you would associate with that car even though markets this car to a much younger audience   i found that it had a number of features that appealed to me   the styling   a bit annoying at first   grew on me   my wife and niece think the car is   cute   for just over     paid for my hatchback model zx   the car is well equipped with   l   quot zetec quot   engine    hp   power windows doors   a c   automatic transmission   more on that later   cruise control   front and rear mats   remote entry system and alarm   tilt telescoping steering wheel   and a surprisingly adequate cd radio combination   i like to listen to loud classical music    with plenty of low brass   the radio even can adjust its sound level automatically to deal with ambient noise   about the only option i would have like to have added was the side impact air bags   which are available    a rarity in a car of this class   i m    quot   and have a pretty wide body   but the seats are quite supportive and the head room excellent   the telescoping steering wheel was a big plus   since i did have to tilt the driver side seat back   then again   i ve had to do that in much larger cars   handling is fairly crisp   especially for an american small car   but overall ride quality is quite decent   as is road noise   fit and finish is excellent   comparable to small japanese cars has hit the nail on the head with this award winning   world car   or at least come closer than they have before to producing a small car that can take on the hondas and toyota small models   the only inconveniences are small ones   for a   hp    ft lb torque engine   the automatic transmission ratios do not seem terribly well implemented   i had test driven a coupe model with the standard   speed which seemed much more responsive   i find a lot of downshifting required to accelerate promptly   on the highway   a convenient   quot overdrive off quot   button on the shifter makes this somewhat easier   zx s don t seem to come with center consoles   which leaves your right arm sort of hanging   front passenger seats   although equipped with a handle to tilt out of the rear passengers   way   do not automatically slide out of the way as do many other small cars   seats   cd player can not fast forward through tracks   a minor but odd omission all in all   if you re looking for a small   fun   inexpensive   well built   and cute car   you d do worse than to test drive the focus   also available   but not reviewed   are several models of sedan with differing trim levels   se   lx   zts   a station wagon se   and a couple of   quot custom quot   models including the sony and   i think   one featuring a trek bicycle and rack   with a unique color called   quot dirt quot     
1367,1,  i bought my focus   se sony edition as a new leftover about a month ago   and i am extremely pleased with it   i bought it to replace my escort se   which was a decent car   but nowhere near as fun as the focus   i have also previously owned a   subaru loyale   which felt like an old lady car   and a   mitsubishi eclipse   which was not a very good car   but there was some fun to it   and i like the focus by far the best first   handling and driving   i have seen a few opinions that say that this car is not quite as peppy as the writers   expectations   i disagree   i have a bit of a lead foot   and i find that the car does quite well at higher speeds   i live in philadelphia   and travel on interstate   daily   and you have to be able to drive between   and   mph to keep up   it doesn t take the car long to get to those speeds   mine is a   speed manual z tec engine   and the car performs very well with no shimmying or shaking   the ride is extremely smooth for a small car   and pot holes and bumps are barely noticeable   which in philadelphia is almost an impossibility   second   features   granted   my model is a much more   packed   model than most of the other focuses   or is it foci   due to the fact that it is a special edition   but i don t feel that i paid an exorbitant amount for the features i got   my model has all leather seats   all electric   windows   mirrors   etc   sport package   spoiler and wheels   and of course the sony xplode stereo    speaker package   all of these amenities are easily accessible to the driver without much reaching   due not only to the fact that it is a small car and the instrument panel is not far from you   but also to the fact that the interior engineering is   in a word   terrific   i am not sure how the features compare on the base model   but i would say that if you are going to buy this car   go for the features   because for the small expense   you will find that they really are worth it third   design   this car is designed very well   it is slightly wider and longer than the escort   it would probably be more appropriate to compare it to the contour   but i don t have much experience with that particular car   but the car is much higher   the additional height makes for a much more comfortable ride for taller drivers   i m     because your legs don t get all cramped up underneath the dash   it also provides additional head room   of which i am not accustomed   there is at least a good    between the top of my head and the ceiling   and for me that is a definite plus   the seats are adjustable up and down   so i m certain that shorter drivers will get as much enjoyment out of this car as taller   and lets face it   the car actually looks pretty good   i have read the biographies on the engineering of this car   and it was mostly designed in europe   the sleeker design and headlight placement give this car a little more personality than its predecessors the escort and contour   passengers that have ridden in the back seat have commented that it is surprisingly comfortable for a small car   and the rear leg room was much more than expected forth   it s a   for a while   was a bit of a punchline      fix or repair daily   or found on road dead   but in the last   or so years   they have really changed things around   the redesign of the escort   tempo   which essentially became the contour   and taurus in the   model year went very well   my escort required no major repairs    i never even had to get tires on it after   years and     miles   and from what i m reading   the focus takes even further steps in being a maintenance free car in short   i would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a smaller   but really not too small   that is fun to drive  
1368,1,  has done it again   they have crammed a ton of engineering in a sport value package   i was extremely impressed by this car   from the outside it looks like a new edge design   nothing too special there   once you get in you know its something different   the interior is wonderfully laid out   the stereo is near perfect   the right touch   button size and distance from both passengers   the materials scream quality for    like no other i ve been in   the interior material also has style   something i ca nt say for most value oriented cars   the seats are comfortable   the room   amazing   i m      and i could easy sit in any of the seats   the middle rear is a stretch   the steering wheel and shifter feel like they have been stolen off an a european sports sedan   the zetec four   should come clean   they must have stolen that off a japanese car   smooth   nice sound   good power   no way an american   cylinder   the suspension   wow   its fun to drive too   imagine that   has really done it with this car   this segment is full of buzzing econoboxes   but this car stands apart   numbers on its datasheet ca nt tell you about this car   you need to drive it to understand   yea there are cars that can do all of these things better but not at this price   that is the key   for this amount of money its a true value   put a lot of thought into the car   safety   reliability   simplicity   performance   looks and value   great package perfomance   for this segment its great   acceleration   handing and steering are all top of the pack   the engine could be a bit more powerful but i will wait for a svt version for that   a larger wheel tire package would be nice too comfort   the seats are good   they are nt volvo seats but for this size car they are comfortable for long trips and around town   they could use some more bolstering for spirited driving   styling   that s a personal opinion   i find the car attractive   not an attention getter but not too cute like the beetle   the front end is nice but the rest of the car seems a little bland   again this is not a very expensive car so i ca nt complain safety   almost all products   lets not get into tires here   have high crash ratings   the focus   package is well put together and solid   airbag equipment is present   its brakes are good   traction control option would be nice   added cost though     
1369,1,  i am currently driving a focus   my van is in the shop and i got this car as a rental   i was exited to get it as i was just checking them out on the lot at the dealership   my husband in the next year or two will be needing a new car and this in in our price range the first thing i noticed after getting in the car was the roominess my husband is   quot   tall and has no problem fitting in it   it feels like you are not in fact in a compact car   but after driving it for the last few days i have been noticing little things that i don t like about it   one is the fact that there is no arm rest between the front seats   for me it was uncomfortable to have no place to put my arm   also i had a hard time adjusting the seat back   the handle for it is in an awkward position and i had to open the door to gain access to it   also i understand that the focus is a compact but it seems to work really hard to get to highway speeds   this might be due to engine size but i don t know what size it has one last thing i did not like is the shifter   the car i have is an automatic and you can easily knock the shifter into another gear without pushing in the button a plus of the focus is that it comes with tether anchors for car seats   three of them   i don t know that three car seats could actually fit back there but two definitely could   the car sits a little higher up than other compacts that i have been in   you don t feel like someone could drive right over you   all in all i thought it was a good basic car   great for a first car or a second family car   it seems to get great gas mileage   i myself prefer my van but hey   if someone gave me this car i wouldn t turn it down     
1370,1,  i bought my focus hatchback in late november     and i now have almost    miles on it   it s the only new car i ve ever bought that didn t have any   bugs   everything is perfect   i handles so well   it rides nicely   gets decent gas mileage   and is very nimble    easy to park   i bought it because it was unusual looking   to tell the truth   the honda civic was my other choice   but that car hasn t changed much in the last   years especially the interior   i just wanted something that not many people had   and even a year later   i don t see many hatchbacks mostly sedans are running around in l a there are a few things that i would change   the side view mirrors stick out too far i ve almost caught them on the garage wall several times   i still haven t been able to spot the oil filter in the engine compartment so i take it to the dealer for oil changes   i liked the seat s back support a little better in the civic consumer reports recently rated it as the best small car they ve tested even better than the jetta   if   they   liked it   you know it s a good car   i think their one complaint was that the doors didn t automatically unlock when you turn off the car   well   i would like to be the one who decides when to unlock the doors   what if you re in an iffy neighborhood   to wrap up you can t go wrong with this car   a note   the hatchback is built at s factory in hermosillo   mexico   this plant has the highest quality output of all the factories in north america   i can attest to the quality   as my car has no squeaks or rattles   the sedan and wagon are built in wayne   michigan   from what i ve heard   their quality is good too   but the mexico factory has a better reputation i got the car for    over invoice    no doc fee at crystal in silver spring maryland   update     car now has    miles    still not a single problem   really glad i bought this car   i read consumer reports    they say that the focus isn t that reliable   but i think they must be talking about the sedan    wagon   i have no regrets    i think the hatchback would be a great used car for anyone  
1371,1,  i recently purchased the   focus   i am very impressed with the   valve    litre engine   the engine provides lots of power   there is plenty of room in the front and rear seats   my baby car seat fits comfortably in the rear seat   the console is attractively designed and has an original look   the led display on the radio gives the time and station simultaneously   the manufacturer s cd and stereo system operate smoothly and provide decent sound   the car gets excellent gas mileage and performs well on the highway   it is convenient being able to access the trunk from the interior of the car   the windows and mirrors provide good   degree visibility   for first time car buyers   this is the one   the price is reasonable for what you get   the car is inexpensive but has a luxury feel br br  
1372,1,  i am definitely not a girl   everyone i have ever known who has owned a has called it a nightmarish experience   then there are the cute acronyms     quot found on road dead quot   or   quot fix or repair daily quot   this past week   however   i drove a car that might start to change my mind   i had the delight of driving a   focus   if i were to ever break down and purchase a   this would have to be the car for me when i first sat in the car   it looked like the interior of a jet   the dash board is designed so that all the controls for the air conditioning and the radio as within a comfortable reach of the arm   therefore   the driver need not lean in anyway to adjust the radio or control the temperature   often when people lean with their bodies inside the car to do anything   they accidentally steer the car in that direction   not needing to lean over to make these adjustments may avoid an accident the gas pedal offers just the right amount of tension   the driver need not press the pedal all the way to the floor just to go sixty   but it is not so sensitive that you sneeze and   poof   your doing    the overdrive control button is on the gear shift   this was a new one to me because i had never even heard of overdrive before   the chairs were designed for the ultimate in comfort   the seat on the driver s chair has a crank which allows you to adjust the seat back to the correct position for you using the minimalist of adjustment   the steering wheel telescopes as well as tilts   the turn signals are fairly quiet and unobtrusive   so you are not stuck at a light with your turn signal on hearing an annoying   quot click   click   click quot   the light which illuminates the dash board is soft and not glaring   the head lights are adjusted using a dial on the dash to the driver s left   which change the lights from off   to parking lamps   to head lights   the brights come on by clicking the turn signal wand toward you once   on most   compacts   i could not even find the control for the brights   another light control which is usually difficult for me to find is the hazards   on the focus   the hazard lights are controlled by a button on the dash   right above the radio where you can not miss it   the car s gas tank fills with about     the trunk has a phenomenal amount of room   the cabin is large enough so that my boyfriend who is    quot   could sit comfortably the car has many safety feature   too   it comes with air bags   it also comes with special anchors along the top of the back seat to better secure a child s safety seat   it has a gear lock    a safety feature which allows you to lock the gears so that you can not move the car out of park with out pressing down on the break first   the trunk has a latch on the inside that allows you to pop the trunk if you should get locked inside it   this is a safety feature i think that any person with children should look for in a car it also comes equipped with quite a few luxury items which i never knew existed   but now want in every car i own   it has a clear digital mileage display   the top display is the amount of miles you traveled that day   and the bottom display is the total miles traveled   the cabin light does not just turn off suddenly    it fades to black   the radio has an option that allows it to become louder when the engine revs   and softer as the car slows down so that you can always hear your radio comfortably   the air conditioning system does not just go from hot to cold   but has many subtle levels in between allot of thought was put into every aspect of the focus   this car was a dream to handle   maneuvered easily   and was a joy to drive   i do not think i even scratched the surface   but for the six days i had the car   i practically lived in it   if i could find a car that even equals the focus   i might get it   but   in the end   i think i may just have to break down and buy this car br br  
1373,1,  i managed to get ahold of the keys for a new   model year focus zx   honestly   i wasn t sure what to expect from this car   i d seen small fords before   specifically the escort   and remembered that that vehicle was characterized by a bare bones interior   very little power   and sloppy handling   the focus blew most of my expectations out of the water it s equipped with a rather gutsy   liter zetec four cylinder   the engine is reasonably quick to respond   and provides good acceleration for a car of this class and price range   stopping power was handled by front disc rear drum brakes   and the vehicle stopped reliably   however   the pedal feel was too spongy for my liking   and the car as a whole felt rather dull as far as powertrain the car s transmission shifted well   but hunted a bit for gears and hesitated slightly when power was demanded of it   while acceptable for a car of this class   it s not a sportster by any means however   the handling is an entirely different story   the car rides on   quot   diameter wheels   with low profile tires   alloy wheels are standard on this model   and the split five spoke design fits the car quite well   without drawing too much attention to them   the car s handling is very crisp and precise   the power rack and pinion steering is well weighted   providing enough resistance to feel just right   without being overboosted   the car has a very sprightly   nimble feel to it that most people will enjoy   especially in a car of this class the interior is actually reasonably equipped   the front buckets are comfortable   but i wouldn t want to be stuck in them for more than a few hours   rear seat room is typically cramped   as is rear headroom   front headroom   however   is not a problem   front legroom   on the other hand   is   the seat could use another inch or two of travel   as even pushed all the way back   it was just not far back enough   and my knee brushed against the steering column   a tilt wheel is an option   and one i reccomend you get   otherwise   the guages could be obstructed by the steering wheel   the radio controls in this car are fairly large   and easy to use   this car had the cd stereo   and it sounded fairly good   with some distortion at high volumes   however   there s quite enough power in the stock unit to overcome most road noise   not that there is much   for a compact car   this vehicle has a well behaved   quiet ride   highway irregularities are for the most part ignored   and only the bigger stuff gets really noticed   again   they ve dialed in just a little bit of that feel that makes a good car great this is a solid   well rouned economy car   that is also a good budget enthusiast s car   with spirited handling and a reasonably comfortable interior   this s not a bad choice at all br br  
1374,1,  i bought the focus because of the overall value and quality of the car   my focus came with all the options except a cd changer and it was under   grand   i love how the car handles and rides   i had a mercury mystique before the focus and this car is so much more refined in the ride and comfort of all passengers   the only complaint i have about the suspension of the vehicle is that when riding over dips over the road sometimes there is a thump sound from the front of the car   the powertrain of my focus came with the   horsepower    liter zetec four cylinder mated to a   speed manual tranny that motivates the car pretty good   the tranny is matched perfect with the engine   providing pretty good acceleration in all gears   the seats are very supportive and comfortable on long trips   the design of the dash is ergonomic and it looks good   everything is where it should be   within easy reach from the driver s seat and the tilting telescoping steering wheel is a nice addition   there are three cupholders in the focus   one in the back of the center console for a rear passenger   and two up front   the front cupholders are allright for soda cans and bottles   but don t try to put a big gulp in them because the dash hangs down too low   trunk space is a very respectable   cubic feet and the fuel tank holds    gallons which will give you an estimated range of   miles in town based on   miles per gallon and   miles on the highway based on   miles a gallon   the sound system in the focus is surprisingly good considering that all four of the speakers are in the doors   you can turn the volume up and the speakers will not distort   overall   i love my focus   and for the money you get a whole lot of car br br  
1375,1,  i had the opportunity to rent a   door focus in germany earlier this year   i drove it from cologne down to mannheim and back twice   and also hit the twisties along the mosel river   the car is excellent   absolutely no wind noise   very little road noise   and decent if not abundant   power   the car easily cruises at      mph even in the uphill sections   the car also does a respectable job in the stoplight grand prix if the competition is not to stout   i can only confirm what has already been written about the handling   even with the skinny rental tires it is too bad that the   door apparently isn t sold here in the us   it is the best version with the versatility of the   doors with the styling of the coupe   the driving position fit this    quot    pounder perfectly i also rented a   door sedan with auto trans here in the us   other than the expected lack of grunt with the auto i found this version a superb car br br  
1376,1,  i am not generally a fan of small cars   especially the four door econobox variety   i am a fairly good sized person and like my space when i drive   my wife is a fan of small cars but shares my opinion about the   quot cookie cutter quot   sameness of the majority of sub compact offerings available today   the one thing we do agree on is   quot four cylinders   speeds quot   no slushboxes allowed in our vehicles   we both expect a vehicle to perform and have a reasonable level of over   the road comfort   on a whim   we recently stopped at a dealer who had a number of focus cars on the lot   i had looked at the four door model before and was not impressed enough to drive one since they had all contained automatic transmissions   what caught my eye this time was the one vehicle that had two doors   a manual transmission and a very non conforming appearence   we took a drive in the zx and it was love at first sight   the car has what i consider to be a very european appearence   no glitz   everything is where it is for a reason   the vehicle accelerates and handles far out of expectation to it s sticker price   finally   the seat was more confortable than the standard size car we had just test   driven at another dealer   i did not feel confined and my wife did not have the big car blues   bottom line is that the focus zx is the pick of the litter in the low cost   small car class   we bought it     
1377,1,  in june we bought the sony limited edition focus se   dr sedan   simply put this is one great little car   we have the vehicle equipped with at   ps pb   pw   pdl   cc   tilt wheel   comfort group   sport group   alarm w   keyless entry   and the awsome sony xplod stereo   the sony limited edition focus is a limited production of   vehicles   and comes in at   amp    spd   and is only available in four color choices   green   black   infa red    amp   going platinum   with the last being unique only to the sony edition   the sony xplod has a cd head unit w    pre sets   a cd player w   remote   and a   watt amplifier   amp    quot   sub woofer mounted in the trunk   it is one awsome stereo   and will drive you out of the vehicle if you really crank it up   i have never heard such a wonderful clear sound in a vehicle until we bought this sony focus   i would really recommend this to anyone who loves music   all comes wrapped in a great vehicle the vehicle itself is very roomy   extremely comfortable in both front and back   and plenty of legroom too   the car handles and drives like a much more expensive vehicle   we had a   camry that did not ride or drive any where near as nice as the focus   we got the z tec engine as part of the sport group   and would say that would the engine i would recommend   it puts out   hp   and is plenty powerful for   adults in the car   and even on hilly terrain   the only bad thing about the car is the poorly designed and placed cupholders   they sit on either side and in front of the gear shift lever   this leaves little room to reach a cup   and is very limiting to size of cup as well   not a huge issue to an otherwise great little car   it was also announced this week   that the focus is top selling car in the world   to go along with all the awards   all i have to say is watch out toyota and honda   here comes the focus br br  
1378,1,  after    miles   we decided to replace my wife s   toyota camry   we found the new camrys to be overpriced   offering essentially   technology with seats that weren t as adjustable or as comfortable as the old ones   so we started shopping around much to our amazement   we ended up buying a focus station wagon with the ztec engine   this car is amazing it is the easiest car to get in and out of and has great seats   really important if you have a bad back   the doors open wide   the seats sit high   and the car has a high roof line    the seating couldn t be much better   i m    quot   and can sit with inches to spare between the top of my head and the roof   my wife is    quot   and can adjust the seat to fit her perfectly   the seats offer great support   too   they seem to have just the right amount of firmness and are designed to help you sit properly   without slouching   there is plenty of room in the back seat   too the   quot trunk quot   door height is just perfect for loading things   this is the first car we have owned that makes it easy to load groceries   the car is loaded with features    electric windows   locks   trunk door release   cruise control   mirrors   cd player   power brakes   tilt steering wheel   automatic transmission   center arm rest   cup holders   filtered air hvac system   etc   the interior light stays on after you leave the car   and then gradually dims and shuts off the design and placement of the instruments and controls   and even the dashboard vents   couldn t be better   really took consumers into account when this car was designed the car is inexpensive to operate   it gets about   mpg on regular gasoline   the car handles extremely well   the steering is precise with good road feedback   the brakes are abs front disks and rear drums   and in our experience offer good stopping   and the   quot   tires aren t firestone   the transmission is as smooth as you can find   the finish and fit are both excellent the car has a few disadvantages but i would not call them problems   even with the ztec engine it s not as powerful as i would like   but it s more responsive than the four cyl   camry that we replaced   the car tends to be a little noisy   the manual seat adjusters take a little getting used to   does not have a sunroof option   the radio sound system is on the boomy side   there have been two recalls since we bought the car   an inconvenience to deal with in summary   the focus station wagon is a real bargain for most anyone   we have owned toyotas   acuras   hondas   vws   cadillacs   buicks   and oldsmobiles   this is our first and it is without a doubt the best value for the money we have ever seen in an automobile     
1379,1,  the focus is a great little record setting car   it is the first car to ever win north american car of the year   and european car of the year awards   and it definitely deserves it   this car is the same overall length as the escort   but the wheelbase is about   inches longer   this means that the cabin is extremely roomy   the roof is high   enabling the driver to sit up higher   and provide more room   in every direction   designed in europe   it is extremely easy for older people to use   the staff designed a suit which made the wearer feel more elderly   this made it possible for them to design a car that is more friendly to older drivers   this car also looks awesome   the   quot new edge quot   design that uses gives this car a clean   sporty   distinctive look   it is hard to figure out which of the models   sedan   wagon   zx coupe   looks the best   but the wagon is definitely very functional   has scratched plans for an mpv vehicle   and will probably not build a coupe model   it is possible that the new volvo s and v will be built on this platform   but this isn t definite   overall   this car is a steal   it is cheap and gives you a lot of   quot car quot   it was given the revered   quot automobile of the year quot   status   and is great for any kind of person with a low budget for a car   if the looks don t hook you   the drive will   i recommend the zx model because it is the cheapest and has the most standard features     zetec engine at about   bhp   cd player standard   etc   in the month of july   the focus was the th best selling vehicle in america with about    units   the only real down side to the focus is the interior   in my opinion   it could have been made much nicer   the buttons feel a little fragile   the seats are great   but the headrests are terrible   my    nissan sentra has a very nice interior   it is simple and durable   overall   the focus is a great car   and it leads the class in almost every way br br  
1380,1,  i needed a new car because my hyundai excel   had it so i decided to shop around for a nice small car with a affordable price tag i wasn t really thinking about american car because of all the negative talk i was thinking more of a honda accord nissan altima jetta so i went to the closest car place which so happens to be   quot quot   so i browsed around for a bit see what i would like quot i just knew i wasn t going to see nothing i like and there it was a car i thought didn t make a car that stood out from the rest of their cars the   quot focus quot this car was really different when i looked inside the window and saw the inside and saw how spacious it was for a small car so i said to myself they probably want alot for this car i looked at the ticket price and said i have to have this car   quot this is in my budget quot i love the roomy interior and easy the controls are to reach the way the seats feel is very comfortable i m not to found of the lumbar when it is lowered too low it leaves a big space it needs a little more horsepower though it rides nicely on the streets but rough going up a steep hill it s very comforting driving a long ride when the seat is up it makes you feel on the same level of a   quot suv quot   this is certainly a great economical car i think anybody who is looking for a small affordable car with a midsize car feel once you sit inside you will love the car br br  
1381,1,  the   focus se   door sedan has a spacious interior and a solid feel   i m the only person in my neighborhood to own one   and nearby friends and acquaintances regularly ask me how this stylish and affordable car performs among the first things i tell them is to spend a little extra money and buy a focus model that includes the perky   valve zetec engine   this adds several hundred dollars to the purchase price   but the investment is worth it if you value passing performance on the freeway and climbing ability on hills   i drove   and   models with the underpowered standard engine and came away disappointed   zetec is definitely the way to go engineered the focus to provide a roomy interior and did so with great success   my head always bumped the ceiling in my escort   the car i traded when i bought the focus in november    head rattling is not an issue with the focus   seat height is adjustable   and leg room for a person of my height    ft   is more than ample   front seat passengers gain the most from the cab forward design   passengers in the rear may feel a bit squeezed if passengers in the front use the maximum amount of legroom my focus came with a cd player and am fm radio   sound quality is not concert like   but i didn t expect it to be   i d rate it better than adequate i ve read a number of reviews that said the focus was   fun   to drive   let me jump on that bandwagon   too   steering is responsive and the car   which has   inch tires   hugs the road one caution to prospective purchasers   read the manual   the focus comes with several design features that initially may create the appearance of being minor malfunctions   one of these is the air conditioning light that signals the air conditioning is in use   during certain times   this light comes on automatically as part of a design feature that   apparently   dehumidifies the air in the car to minimize frosting   i ve read some reviews in which people didn t read the owner s manual and reported a suspected malfunction of the air conditioning unit the styling on the focus also appeals to me   and to my inquisitive neighbors   the se model i own has power windows and door locks   keyless entry   tilt wheel   cruise control and other options   gas mileage is about   on the highway    not great   but good   trunk room is surprisingly adequate one small problem is that the cup holders can t accommodate large beverages   another problem is that the car doesn t seem well insulated against road noise hey   i regularly drive a saturn and a toyota corolla   the focus beats them readily in performance   interior room and value   i am very pleased with this purchase
